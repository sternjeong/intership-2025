                  "context": "As electric grids are expanding, there is an increasing need for fault detection and location as well as maintaining system stability in real time which requires precision timing. There is also a raising interest to have other clock synchronization sources in addition to GNSS.\n\nIEC 61850-9-2 standard [49] specifies the protocol for transmitting measurement information in a power system using Ethernet. Standard also recommends the use of PTP (Precision Time Protocol) for clock synchronization and IEC 61850-9-3 standard [7] shall be followed whenever PTP is used. PTP accuracy is affected by network structure and devices in the network. Since different types of clock devices produce different time errors and jitters, overall time inaccuracy must be verified to make sure that application time accuracy requirements are fulfilled. Requirements in IEC 61850-9-3 [7] aim at achieving a network time inaccuracy better than 1ms after crossing 15 transparent clocks or 3 boundary clocks. PTP profile for power utility automation defines the inaccuracy as follows:\n\nTable 5.19.1-1. Allowed inaccuracy defined by IEC 61850-9-3 [7]\n\n| Clock type             | Inaccuracy |\n| Transparent clock (TC) | < 50ns     |\n| Boundary clock (BC)    | < 200ns    |\n| Grandmaster clock      | < 250ns    |\n\nGrandmaster clocks in substations today use a GNSS receiver to achieve accurate clock synchronization with holdover time even up to 24h (corresponding to <1ms accuracy). However, since the time source (GNSS) may become unavailable due to failure (e.g. broken antenna, satellite availability or interference), 5G is a candidate resiliency solution (see [51] clause 5.2). In order to reach the same level of measurement accuracy, 5G capable grandmaster clock should fulfil the requirement of maximum 250ns inaccuracy when its timing reference is used in the same location as of the Grandmaster clock that is used to synchronize the Smart Grid devices over Ethernet.\n\nSynchronization requirements are related to various aspects. In particular, IEC/IEEE 60255-118-1:2018 [50] defines a Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU) that must maintain less than a 1% total vector error (TVE). Such error includes time, phasor angle, and phasor magnitude estimation errors. Standard also recommends that a time source that reliably provides time, should be at least 10 times better than values corresponding to 1 % TVE. Therefore IEC 61850-9-3 [7] should be followed whenever substation has PMUs either as standalone devices or PMU capable protection relays.\n\nBy using PTP within a substation the system can have multiple grandmaster capable clocks which, in case of failure of the current grandmaster, can be used to maintain accurate time between devices and processing sampled values. However, when sampled values are processed outside the substation, time inaccuracy limits defined by IEC 61850-9-3 [7] must be followed since the devices are not connected to the same grandmaster clock and therefore measurement timestamps may have too much inaccuracy. Application outside substation may be but not limited to Wide Area Protection.",

Modern PMUs and accompanying entities such as Phasor Data Concentrators (PDCs) [22] could connect to the time source and with each other in a number of different ways such as: using direct connection with GPS via an internal GPS receiver, using a connection via IRIG-B (legacy method) or IEEE Std 1588-2008 [23]/IEEE C37.238-2011[24] or PTP time synchronization profile in IEC 61850-9-3 [7] , over an Ethernet to achieve 1 ms time accuracy.

Some interesting applications based on synchrophasors are: power system model validation, wide-area protection, advanced state estimation, frequency-control and oscillation mitigation, etc. With the fast adoption of DERs, the power system will undergo challenges of increased variability and unpredictability, which means the synchrophasors could offer utility operators an effective means to understand, respond and predict the real-time dynamics of the power systems.\n\nUp till now, wide-area measurement systems based on synchrophasors have been under expansion in large scale throughout America, Europe, and Asia. It is an area of opportunity for 5G systems to provide connectivity and services.

The figure below comes from [25]. But it is important to know that PDCs can have one to many interconnections with each other for the sake of e.g. redundancy. There could be many internal and external functions defined at each PDC, and PDCs could eventually interface with SCADA, EMS and DMS, where applicable. As defined in [25], a PMU and a PDC may transmit its data in one or more separate data streams. Each stream may have different content and may be sent at a different rate. The destination of each stream may be different device(s) and location(s) (multicast data is sent to multiple destinations). Each stream must then be individually controllable, and have its own identification and a separate configuration control. This feature is useful for sending data to different devices with different purposes, allowing streams with different wait times and class of service (M and P class), as specified in [22].\n\nFigure 5.13.1.1: Synchrophasor data collection network [X6]\n\nWithin the synchrophasor system, PMUs can be configured with various reporting rates [25]. In a 60Hz system, reporting rates could be {12, 15, 20, 3, 60} per second, and in a 50Hz system, the reporting rates could be {25, 50} per second.

In [28], the real-time communication between PMUs is addressed, and there two performance classes (P and M) are specified with the corresponding dynamic performance requirements. The P class is mainly for protection and control purposes, which requires fast response, minimum filtering and minimum delay. The M class is mainly used for measurements in the presence of out-of-band signals, which requires greater precision and significant filtering, and allows slower response and longer delay.

With the advent of GNSS and other time sources that provide phasor measurement units (PMUs) with accurate timing signals, the concept of synchrophasor came into existence [21]. Modern PMUs and accompanying entities such as Phasor Data Concentrators (PDCs) [22] could connect to the time source and with each other in a number of different ways such as: using direct connection with GPS via an internal GPS receiver, using a connection via IRIG-B (legacy method) or IEEE Std 1588-2008 [23]/IEEE C37.238-2011[24] or PTP time synchronization profile in IEC 61850-9-3 [7] , over an Ethernet to achieve 1 ms time accuracy. This 1 ms time accuracy as referred to in these IEC standards assumes every PMU is has a built-in synchronization modem.\n\nAs a result, the phasors throughout a wide-area power system can be measured at different but strategically selected locations (such as at tie-lines and on the key network buses) in a synchronized fashion. This powerful possibility releases huge potential for power utility operators to innovate, so as to achieve various goals in safe, robust and efficient network operation and maintenance. Some interesting applications based on synchrophasors are: power system model validation, wide-area protection, advanced state estimation, frequency-control and oscillation mitigation, etc. With the fast adoption of DERs, the power system will undergo challenges of increased variability and unpredictability, which means the synchrophasors could offer utility operators an effective means to understand, respond and predict the real-time dynamics of the power systems.\n\nUp till now, wide-area measurement systems based on synchrophasors have been under expansion in large scale throughout America, Europe, and Asia. It is an area of opportunity for 5G systems to provide connectivity and services. Thanks for the wide-area coverage of 5G, it is seen by many utilities that 5G could play a major role in supporting PMU wide-area applications paradigm.\n\nSynchrophasors are measured and collected in a hierarchical structure to meet the power system needs. The figure below comes from [25]. But it is important to know that PDCs can have one to many interconnections with each other for the sake of e.g. redundancy. There could be many internal and external functions defined at each PDC, and PDCs could eventually interface with SCADA, EMS and DMS, where applicable. As defined in [25], a PMU and a PDC may transmit its data in one or more separate data streams. Each stream may have different content and may be sent at a different rate. The destination of each stream may be different device(s) and location(s) (multicast data is sent to multiple destinations). Each stream must then be individually controllable, and have its own identification and a separate configuration control. This feature is useful for sending data to different devices with different purposes, allowing streams with different wait times and class of service (M and P class), as specified in [22].\n\nFigure 5.13.1.1: Synchrophasor data collection network [X6]\n\nWithin the synchrophasor system, PMUs can be configured with various reporting rates [25]. In a 60Hz system, reporting rates could be {12, 15, 20, 3, 60} per second, and in a 50Hz system, the reporting rates could be {25, 50} per second. It is encouraged to adopt higher rates up to 120 per second.

In [28], the real-time communication between PMUs is addressed, and there two performance classes (P and M) are specified with the corresponding dynamic performance requirements. The P class is mainly for protection and control purposes, which requires fast response, minimum filtering and minimum delay. The M class is mainly used for measurements in the presence of out-of-band signals, which requires greater precision and significant filtering, and allows slower response and longer delay.

The UE shall set the TIN when receiving an Attach Accept, a TAU Accept or RAU Accept message according to the rules in table 4.3.5.6-1.\n\nTable 4.3.5.6-1: Setting of the TIN\n\n| Message received by UE                                           | Current TIN value stored by UE   | TIN value to be set by the UE when receiving message |\n| Attach Accept via E-UTRAN; (never indicates \"ISR Activated\")     | Any value                        | GUTI                                                 |\n| Attach Accept via GERAN/UTRAN; (never indicates \"ISR Activated\") | Any value                        | P-TMSI                                               |\n| TAU Accept; not indicating \"ISR Activated\"                       | Any value                        | GUTI                                                 |\n| TAU Accept; indicating \"ISR Activated\"                           | GUTI; P-TMSI or RAT-related TMSI | GUTI; RAT-related TMSI                               |\n| RAU Accept; not indicating \"ISR Activated\"                       | Any value                        | P-TMSI                                               |\n| RAU Accept; indicating \"ISR Activated\"                           | P-TMSI; GUTI or RAT-related TMSI | P-TMSI; RAT-related TMSI                             |\n\nWhen \"ISR Activated\" is indicated by the RAU/TAU Accept message but the UE shall not set the TIN to \"RAT-related TMSI\" is a special situation. Here the UE has deactivated ISR due to special situation handling. By maintaining the old TIN value the UE remembers to use the RAT specific TMSI indicated by the TIN when updating with the CN node of the other RAT.\n\nOnly if the TIN is set to \"RAT-related TMSI\" ISR behaviour is enabled for the UE, i.e. the UE can change between all registered areas and RATs without any update signalling and it listens for paging on the RAT it is camped on. If the TIN is set to \"RAT-related TMSI\", the UE's P-TMSI and RAI as well as its GUTI and TAI(s) shall remain registered with the network and shall remain valid in the UE.\n\nTable 4.3.5.6-2: Temporary UE Identity that the UE shall indicate in Attach Request and TAU/RAU Request (as \"old GUTI\" or as \"old P-TMSI/RAI\" information element)\n\n| Message to be sent by UE       | TIN value: P-TMSI           | TIN value: GUTI             | TIN value: RAT-related TMSI |\n| TAU Request                    | GUTI mapped from P-TMSI/RAI | GUTI                        | GUTI                        |\n| RAU Request                    | P-TMSI/RAI                  | P-TMSI/RAI mapped from GUTI | P-TMSI/RAI                  |\n| Attach Request via E-UTRAN     | GUTI mapped from P-TMSI/RAI | GUTI                        | GUTI                        |\n| Attach Request via GERAN/UTRAN | P-TMSI/RAI                  | P-TMSI/RAI mapped from GUTI | P-TMSI/RAI                  |\n\nTable 4.3.5.6-2 shows which temporary identity the UE shall indicate in a Tracking or Routing Area Update Request or in an Attach Request message, when the UE stores these as valid parameters.\n\nSituations may occur that cause unsynchronized state information in the UE, MME and SGSN. Such special situations trigger a deactivation of ISR locally in the UE.\n\nThe UE shall deactivate ISR locally by setting its TIN to the temporary identity of the currently used RAT in following special situations:\n\n- Modification of any EPS bearer context or PDP context which was activated before the ISR is activated in the UE;\n\n- At the time when the UE moves from E-UTRAN to GERAN/UTRAN or moves from GERAN/UTRAN to E-UTRAN by means other than PSHO, if any EPS bearer context or PDP context activated after the ISR was activated in the UE exists;\n\n- At the time when the UE moves from GERAN/UTRAN to E-UTRAN by means other than PSHO and CS to PS SRVCC, if the PDP contexts were suspended in GERAN and not successfully resumed before returning to E-UTRAN;\n\n- After updating either MME or SGSN about the change of the UE specific DRX parameters to guarantee that the other CN node is also updated;\n\n- After updating either MME or SGSN about the change of the UE Core Network Capabilities to guarantee that the other CN node is also updated;\n\n- E-UTRAN selection by a UTRAN-connected UE (e.g. when in URA_PCH to release Iu on UTRAN side);\n\n- E-UTRAN selection from GERAN READY state;\n\n- GERAN selection by an E-UTRAN-connected UE via Cell Change Order that is not for CS fallback;\n\n- After a LAU procedure if the UE has CS fallback and/or SMS over SGs activated.\n\n- For a UE that is IMS registered for voice, then after that UE moves from a Tracking Area List that supports IMS voice over PS sessions (see 4.3.5.8 for more information) to one that does not, and vice versa. It shall be possible, e.g. using Device Management or initial provisioning, to configure the UE to apply/not apply this particular exception.\n\nNOTE 2: A UE moving between Tracking Area Lists that both support IMS voice over PS sessions, or that both do not support IMS voice over PS sessions, is unaffected by the above.\n\nThe UE shall deactivate ISR locally by setting its TIN to the temporary identity of the RAT that is still available to the UE in following special situations:\n\n- After the RAT-specific Deactivate ISR timer expires, e.g. because the coverage of that RAT is lost or the RAT is no more selected by the UE (this may result also in implicit detach by SGSN or MME).\n\nISR shall be deactivated in the UE by the CN node using normal update signalling, i.e. by omitting the signalling of \"ISR Activated\", in following special situations:\n\n- CN node change resulting in context transfer between the same type of CN nodes (SGSN to SGSN or MME to MME);\n\n- Serving GW change;\n\n- When the UE only has bearers related to emergency bearer service;\n\n- When the UE is registered for RLOS service;\n\n- TAU or RAU when UE moves over the border between local and macro network where SIPTO at local network with stand-alone GW and Serving GW relocation without mobility are supported in the core network.\n\n- TAU or RAU when the network confirms to use PSM for the UE.\n\nIf tracking area list or routing area covers both local network and macro network, the ISR shall not be activated if the UE is allowed to use SIPTO at local network and Serving GW relocation without mobility are supported in the core network.",

The conditioning sequence shall be comprised of the four additional sentences 1- 4 described in ETSI TS 103 106 [34], applied to the beginning of the 16-sentence test sequence. The conditioning signal level is +1.3 dBPa at the MRP, measured as active speech level according to ITU-T P.56 [37].\n\nNOTE: The sequence of speech samples concatenated for the test signal, consisting of alternating talkers in the sending direction, reduces the overall test time but may represent an unrealistic behaviour for certain voice enhancement technologies. Alternative concatenations are for further study.\n\n2) The send speech signal consists of the 16 sentences of speech as described in ETSI TS 103 106 [34]. The test signal level is +1.3dBPa at the MRP, measured as active speech level according to ITU-T P.56 [37]. Three signals are required for the tests:\n\n- The clean speech signal is used as the undisturbed reference (see ETSI TS 103 106 [34], ETSI EG 202 396-3 [36]).\n\n- The speech plus undisturbed background noise signal is recorded at the terminal's microphone position using an omnidirectional measurement microphone with a linear frequency response between 50 Hz and 12 kHz.\n\n- The send signal is recorded at the POI.\n\n3) N-MOS-LQOn, S-MOS-LQOn and G-MOS-LQOn are calculated as described in ETSI TS 103 106 [34] on a per sentence basis and averaged over all 16 sentences. The results shall be reported as average and standard deviation.\n\n4) The measurement is repeated for each ambient noise condition described in Table 2d2.\n\n5) The average of the results derived from all ambient noise types is calculated.",

In order to fulfil the end-to-end QoS requirements for the AR session, the AR UE need to acquire the tethering link status via measurement tests or empirical values, and takes it into account when determining the QoS for the 5G system link. With the tethering link status, the Media Access Function may communicate with AF for dynamic QoS policy adjustment accordingly.",

Table 5.3.1-1 illustrates the typical estimated power load now and future in the area.\n\nTable 5.3.1-1: the typical power load estimated in the CBD\n\n| Growth rate | Now(2020); (MW) | Long future (2030); (MW) | Power load density (Now); (MW/km2) | Power load density (future); (MW/km2) |\n| High        | 1043            | 1454                     | 20.72                              | 28.89                                 |\n| Middle      | 1003            | 1348                     | 19.93                              | 26.78                                 |\n| Low         | 952             | 1277                     | 18.91                              | 25.37                                 |\n\nGenerally, one single urban medium voltage distribution line should not be separated exceed 4 segments, and the load of each segment should not exceed 1MW. So, for one single circuit 10kV distribution line, the line load should not be higher than 4MW (1MW*4 = 4MW). In the medium level listed in the above table, the load density of the CBD area is about 20MW / km2, the number of 10kV lines per square kilometre can be calculated as follows:\n\nN = 20mV / 4MW = 5.\n\nAccording to the distribution network reliability configuration principle, one backup is required and the N will be 6.\n\nConsidering the switches per segment and additional switches on the high voltage side, the number of required distribution terminal n can be calculated as follow:\n\n- Overhead line scenario: n = 6 * (5+4) = 54.\n\nNOTE:  \"6\" represents the number of 10kV lines per square kilometre, \"5\" is switches number per line, \"4\" is the number of the boundary switch which is installed on the high voltage side of the distribution transformer of each segment of the line.\n\n- Power distribution cabinets scenario: n = 6 * (4 * 3 + 1) = 78.\n\nNOTE:  \"6\" represents the number of 10kV lines, \"4\" means the number of distribution cabinet in one 10kV line. \"3\" is the number of switch including the boundary switch in each power distribution cabinet, \"1\" means every line end has a switch to monitor the line.\n\nIn the future, when the power load density increases, or with differential protection utilized in the Feeder automation, more distribution terminals (e.g. more than 100) need to be considered.",

                  "context": "The AI/ML-based mobile applications are increasingly computation-intensive, memory-consuming and power-consuming. Meanwhile end devices usually have stringent energy consumption, compute and memory limitations for running a complete offline AI/ML inference on-board. Many AI/ML applications, e.g. image recognition, currently intent to offload the inference processing from mobile devices to internet datacenters (IDC). For example, photos shot by a smartphone are often processed in a cloud AI/ML server before shown to the user who shot them. However, the cloud-based AI/ML inference tasks need to take into account the computation pressure at IDCs, required data rate/latency and privacy protection requirement.\n\nImage and video are the biggest data on today's Internet. Videos account for over 70% of daily Internet traffic [4]. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models have be widely used for image/video recognition tasks on mobile devices, e.g. image classification, image segmentation, object localization and detection, face authentication, action recognition, enhanced photography, VR/AR, video games. Meanwhile, CNN model inference requires an intensive computation and storage resource. For example, AlexNet [7], VGG-16 [8] and GoogleNet [9] require 724M, 15.5G and 1.43G MACs (multiply-add computation) respectively for a typical image classification task.\n\nMany references [10-14] have shown that AI/ML inference for image processing with device-network synergy can alleviate the pressure of computation, memory footprint, storage, power and required data rate on devices, reduce end-to-end latency and energy consumption, and improve the end-to-end accuracy, efficiency and privacy when compared to the local execution approach on either side. The scheme of split AI/ML image recognition can be depicted in Figure 5.1.1-1. The CNN is split into two parts according to the current image recognition task and environment. The intention is to offload the computation-intensive, energy-intensive parts to network server, whereas leave the privacy-sensitive and delay- sensitive parts at the end device. The device executes the inference up to a specific CNN layer and sends the intermediate data to the network server. The network server runs through the remaining CNN layers. While the model is developed or invocated, the split AI/ML operation is based on the legacy model.\n\nDue to the characteristics of some algorithms in the model training phase, a model has a certain degree of robustness[xx-xy]. Therefore, if there are errors in the intermediate data transmission, the model has a certain tolerance and can still guarantee the accuracy of the inference results. Since the inference result needs to be forwarded to the UE, the reliability of the inference result transmission needs to be guaranteed.\n\nFigure 5.1.1-1. Example of split AI/ML image recognition\n\nThe split AI/ML image recognition algorithms can be analyzed based on the computation and data characteristics of the layers in the CNN. As shown in figure 5.1.1-2 and 5.1.1-3 (based on figures adopted from [13]), the intermediate data size transferred from one CNN layer to the next depends on the location of the split point. Hence, the required UL data rate is related to the model split point and the frame rate for the image recognition, as also observed by [13-14]. For example, assuming images from a video stream with 30 frames per second (FPS) need to be classified, the required UL data rate for different split points ranges from 4.8 to 65 Mbit/s (listed in Table 5.1.1-1). The result is based on the 227x227 input images. In case of images with a higher resolution, higher data rates would be required.\n\nFigure 5.1.1-2.

                  "context": "The AI/ML-based mobile applications are increasingly computation-intensive, memory-consuming and power-consuming. Meanwhile end devices usually have stringent energy consumption, compute and memory limitations for running a complete offline AI/ML inference on-board. Many AI/ML applications, e.g. image recognition, currently intent to offload the inference processing from mobile devices to internet datacenters (IDC). For example, photos shot by a smartphone are often processed in a cloud AI/ML server before shown to the user who shot them. However, the cloud-based AI/ML inference tasks need to take into account the computation pressure at IDCs, required data rate/latency and privacy protection requirement.\n\nImage and video are the biggest data on today's Internet. Videos account for over 70% of daily Internet traffic [4]. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models have be widely used for image/video recognition tasks on mobile devices, e.g. image classification, image segmentation, object localization and detection, face authentication, action recognition, enhanced photography, VR/AR, video games. Meanwhile, CNN model inference requires an intensive computation and storage resource. For example, AlexNet [7], VGG-16 [8] and GoogleNet [9] require 724M, 15.5G and 1.43G MACs (multiply-add computation) respectively for a typical image classification task.\n\nMany references [10-14] have shown that AI/ML inference for image processing with device-network synergy can alleviate the pressure of computation, memory footprint, storage, power and required data rate on devices, reduce end-to-end latency and energy consumption, and improve the end-to-end accuracy, efficiency and privacy when compared to the local execution approach on either side. The scheme of split AI/ML image recognition can be depicted in Figure 5.1.1-1. The CNN is split into two parts according to the current image recognition task and environment. The intention is to offload the computation-intensive, energy-intensive parts to network server, whereas leave the privacy-sensitive and delay- sensitive parts at the end device. The device executes the inference up to a specific CNN layer and sends the intermediate data to the network server. The network server runs through the remaining CNN layers. While the model is developed or invocated, the split AI/ML operation is based on the legacy model.\n\nDue to the characteristics of some algorithms in the model training phase, a model has a certain degree of robustness[xx-xy]. Therefore, if there are errors in the intermediate data transmission, the model has a certain tolerance and can still guarantee the accuracy of the inference results. Since the inference result needs to be forwarded to the UE, the reliability of the inference result transmission needs to be guaranteed.\n\nFigure 5.1.1-1. Example of split AI/ML image recognition\n\nThe split AI/ML image recognition algorithms can be analyzed based on the computation and data characteristics of the layers in the CNN. As shown in figure 5.1.1-2 and 5.1.1-3 (based on figures adopted from [13]), the intermediate data size transferred from one CNN layer to the next depends on the location of the split point. Hence, the required UL data rate is related to the model split point and the frame rate for the image recognition, as also observed by [13-14]. For example, assuming images from a video stream with 30 frames per second (FPS) need to be classified, the required UL data rate for different split points ranges from 4.8 to 65 Mbit/s (listed in Table 5.1.1-1). The result is based on the 227x227 input images. In case of images with a higher resolution, higher data rates would be required.\n\nFigure 5.1.1-2.

Still assuming images from a video stream with 30 FPS need to be classified, the required UL data rate for different split points ranges from 24 to 720 Mbit/s (listed in Table 5.1.1-2).\n\nFigure 5.1.1-3.

Table 5.7.3-1 depicts the typical QoS requirements that have to be fulfilled in order for the users' QoE to be satisfactory.\n\nTable 5.7.3-1 Typical QoS requirements for multi-modal streams [14] [15] [16] [17] [18]\n\n|                                 |Haptics                      |Video                          |Audio                        |\n|Jitter (ms)                      |<= 2                          |<= 30                           |<= 30                         |\n|Delay (ms)                       |<= 50                         |<= 400                          |<= 150                        |\n|Packet loss (%)                  |<= 10                         |<= 1                            |<= 1                          |\n|Update rate (Hz)                 |>= 1000                       |>= 30                           |>= 50                         |\n|Packet size (bytes)              |64-128                       |<= MTU                          |160-320                      |\n|Throughput (kbit/s)              |512-1024                     |2500 - 40000                   |64-128                       |\n\n3.  The controller starts to capture the first Media Units (MUs) of haptic information, video and voice at the same time. In this case, the three MUs have the same timestamp, which represents the generation time. Assuming that the sampling interval for haptics, video and audio are 1 ms, 30 ms and 20 ms. The source transmits the first haptic MU about 20-30 ms earlier than the MUs of audio and video, which may result in more 20 ms difference between the arrival time of the MUs of different modalities. If the destination outputs the MUs at the same time, it has to delay the output of the haptic MU until the voice and video MUs arrive at the destination.\n\n4.  A Synchronization Unit is assumed to preserve the time relation of the original signal as steady as possible and synchronize the three media streams with each other. This unit can be part of TSM or can be located in the Tactile Edge. Synchronization becomes increasingly challenging with the increasing demand from the application itself, for example immersive XR experience, as well as the inevitable jitter/delay issues (especially due to the nature of the wireless communication) in the network domain. Necessary information is exchanged between the TSM (including the synchronization unit) and the 5G network for the assistance of the synchronization between different streams of a multi-modal communication session. Audio, video and haptic MUs arrive at the Synchronization Unit and are re-synchronized before getting to the destination.",

The 5G QoS model supports both:\n\n- QoS Flows that require guaranteed flow bit rate (GBR QoS Flows)\n\n- and QoS Flows that do not require guaranteed flow bit rate (Non-GBR QoS Flows).\n\nThe 5G QoS model also supports Reflective QoS (see clause 5.7.5 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [8]).\n\nA QoS Flow ID (QFI) is used to identify a QoS Flow in the 5G System. User Plane traffic assigned to the same QoS Flow within a Protocol Data Unit (PDU) Session receives the same traffic forwarding treatment (e.g. scheduling, admission threshold).\n\nThe QFI may be dynamically assigned or may be equal to the 5G QoS Identifier (5QI). A QoS Flow may either be 'GBR', 'Non-GBR' or \"Delay Tolerant GBR\" depending on its QoS profile and it contains QoS parameters as follows:\n\n- For each QoS Flow, the QoS profile includes the QoS parameters:\n\n- 5G QoS Identifier (5QI); and\n\n- Allocation and Retention Priority (ARP).\n\n- For each Non-GBR QoS Flow only, the QoS profile can also include the QoS parameter:\n\n- Reflective QoS Attribute (RQA).\n\n- For each GBR QoS Flow only, the QoS profile also include the QoS parameters:\n\n- Guaranteed Flow Bit Rate (GFBR) - uplink (UL) and downlink (DL); and\n\n- Maximum Flow Bit Rate (MFBR) - UL and DL; and\n\n- In the case of a GBR QoS Flow only, the QoS profile can also include one or more of the QoS parameters:\n\n- Notification control;\n\n- Maximum Packet Loss Rate - UL and DL\n\nThe one-to-one mapping of standardized 5QI values to 5G QoS characteristics is specified in table 5.7.4-1 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [8] and shown below in Table 4.3.3-1.\n\n5QI values potentially

The 5G QoS model supports both:\n\n- QoS Flows that require guaranteed flow bit rate (GBR QoS Flows)\n\n- and QoS Flows that do not require guaranteed flow bit rate (Non-GBR QoS Flows).\n\nThe 5G QoS model also supports Reflective QoS (see clause 5.7.5 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [8]).\n\nA QoS Flow ID (QFI) is used to identify a QoS Flow in the 5G System. User Plane traffic assigned to the same QoS Flow within a Protocol Data Unit (PDU) Session receives the same traffic forwarding treatment (e.g. scheduling, admission threshold).\n\nThe QFI may be dynamically assigned or may be equal to the 5G QoS Identifier (5QI). A QoS Flow may either be 'GBR', 'Non-GBR' or \"Delay Tolerant GBR\" depending on its QoS profile and it contains QoS parameters as follows:\n\n- For each QoS Flow, the QoS profile includes the QoS parameters:\n\n- 5G QoS Identifier (5QI); and\n\n- Allocation and Retention Priority (ARP).\n\n- For each Non-GBR QoS Flow only, the QoS profile can also include the QoS parameter:\n\n- Reflective QoS Attribute (RQA).\n\n- For each GBR QoS Flow only, the QoS profile also include the QoS parameters:\n\n- Guaranteed Flow Bit Rate (GFBR) - uplink (UL) and downlink (DL); and\n\n- Maximum Flow Bit Rate (MFBR) - UL and DL; and\n\n- In the case of a GBR QoS Flow only, the QoS profile can also include one or more of the QoS parameters:\n\n- Notification control;\n\n- Maximum Packet Loss Rate - UL and DL\n\nThe one-to-one mapping of standardized 5QI values to 5G QoS characteristics is specified in table 5.7.4-1 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [8] and shown below in Table 4.3.3-1.\n\n5QI values potentially

the PER. NOTE 2: It is required that default MDBV is supported by a PLMN supporting the related 5QIs.

                  "context": "Clause 5.7 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [8] explains the QoS model for 5G. The 5G QoS model is based on QoS Flows. The 5G QoS model supports both:\n\n- QoS Flows that require guaranteed flow bit rate (GBR QoS Flows)\n\n- and QoS Flows that do not require guaranteed flow bit rate (Non-GBR QoS Flows).\n\nThe 5G QoS model also supports Reflective QoS (see clause 5.7.5 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [8]).\n\nA QoS Flow ID (QFI) is used to identify a QoS Flow in the 5G System. User Plane traffic assigned to the same QoS Flow within a Protocol Data Unit (PDU) Session receives the same traffic forwarding treatment (e.g. scheduling, admission threshold).\n\nThe QFI may be dynamically assigned or may be equal to the 5G QoS Identifier (5QI). A QoS Flow may either be 'GBR', 'Non-GBR' or \"Delay Tolerant GBR\" depending on its QoS profile and it contains QoS parameters as follows:\n\n- For each QoS Flow, the QoS profile includes the QoS parameters:\n\n- 5G QoS Identifier (5QI); and\n\n- Allocation and Retention Priority (ARP).\n\n- For each Non-GBR QoS Flow only, the QoS profile can also include the QoS parameter:\n\n- Reflective QoS Attribute (RQA).\n\n- For each GBR QoS Flow only, the QoS profile also include the QoS parameters:\n\n- Guaranteed Flow Bit Rate (GFBR) - uplink (UL) and downlink (DL); and\n\n- Maximum Flow Bit Rate (MFBR) - UL and DL; and\n\n- In the case of a GBR QoS Flow only, the QoS profile can also include one or more of the QoS parameters:\n\n- Notification control;\n\n- Maximum Packet Loss Rate - UL and DL\n\nThe one-to-one mapping of standardized 5QI values to 5G QoS characteristics is specified in table 5.7.4-1 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [8] and shown below in Table 4.3.3-1.\n\n5QI values potentially relevant for XR applications in the context of this Technical Report are highlighted in italics.\n\nTable 4.3.3-1: Standardized 5QI to QoS characteristics mapping (identical to Table 5.7.4.1-1 in 3GPP

The 5G QoS model supports both:\n\n- QoS Flows that require guaranteed flow bit rate (GBR QoS Flows)\n\n- and QoS Flows that do not require guaranteed flow bit rate (Non-GBR QoS Flows).\n\nThe 5G QoS model also supports Reflective QoS (see clause 5.7.5 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [8]).\n\nA QoS Flow ID (QFI) is used to identify a QoS Flow in the 5G System. User Plane traffic assigned to the same QoS Flow within a Protocol Data Unit (PDU) Session receives the same traffic forwarding treatment (e.g. scheduling, admission threshold).\n\nThe QFI may be dynamically assigned or may be equal to the 5G QoS Identifier (5QI). A QoS Flow may either be 'GBR', 'Non-GBR' or \"Delay Tolerant GBR\" depending on its QoS profile and it contains QoS parameters as follows:\n\n- For each QoS Flow, the QoS profile includes the QoS parameters:\n\n- 5G QoS Identifier (5QI); and\n\n- Allocation and Retention Priority (ARP).\n\n- For each Non-GBR QoS Flow only, the QoS profile can also include the QoS parameter:\n\n- Reflective QoS Attribute (RQA).\n\n- For each GBR QoS Flow only, the QoS profile also include the QoS parameters:\n\n- Guaranteed Flow Bit Rate (GFBR) - uplink (UL) and downlink (DL); and\n\n- Maximum Flow Bit Rate (MFBR) - UL and DL; and\n\n- In the case of a GBR QoS Flow only, the QoS profile can also include one or more of the QoS parameters:\n\n- Notification control;\n\n- Maximum Packet Loss Rate - UL and DL\n\nThe one-to-one mapping of standardized 5QI values to 5G QoS characteristics is specified in table 5.7.4-1 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [8] and shown below in Table 4.3.3-1.\n\n5QI values potentially

The 5G QoS model supports both:\n\n- QoS Flows that require guaranteed flow bit rate (GBR QoS Flows)\n\n- and QoS Flows that do not require guaranteed flow bit rate (Non-GBR QoS Flows).\n\nThe 5G QoS model also supports Reflective QoS (see clause 5.7.5 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [8]).\n\nA QoS Flow ID (QFI) is used to identify a QoS Flow in the 5G System. User Plane traffic assigned to the same QoS Flow within a Protocol Data Unit (PDU) Session receives the same traffic forwarding treatment (e.g. scheduling, admission threshold).\n\nThe QFI may be dynamically assigned or may be equal to the 5G QoS Identifier (5QI). A QoS Flow may either be 'GBR', 'Non-GBR' or \"Delay Tolerant GBR\" depending on its QoS profile and it contains QoS parameters as follows:\n\n- For each QoS Flow, the QoS profile includes the QoS parameters:\n\n- 5G QoS Identifier (5QI); and\n\n- Allocation and Retention Priority (ARP).\n\n- For each Non-GBR QoS Flow only, the QoS profile can also include the QoS parameter:\n\n- Reflective QoS Attribute (RQA).\n\n- For each GBR QoS Flow only, the QoS profile also include the QoS parameters:\n\n- Guaranteed Flow Bit Rate (GFBR) - uplink (UL) and downlink (DL); and\n\n- Maximum Flow Bit Rate (MFBR) - UL and DL; and\n\n- In the case of a GBR QoS Flow only, the QoS profile can also include one or more of the QoS parameters:\n\n- Notification control;\n\n- Maximum Packet Loss Rate - UL and DL\n\nThe one-to-one mapping of standardized 5QI values to 5G QoS characteristics is specified in table 5.7.4-1 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [8] and shown below in Table 4.3.3-1.\n\n5QI values potentially

The 5G QoS model supports both:\n\n- QoS Flows that require guaranteed flow bit rate (GBR QoS Flows)\n\n- and QoS Flows that do not require guaranteed flow bit rate (Non-GBR QoS Flows).\n\nThe 5G QoS model also supports Reflective QoS (see clause 5.7.5 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [8]).\n\nA QoS Flow ID (QFI) is used to identify a QoS Flow in the 5G System. User Plane traffic assigned to the same QoS Flow within a Protocol Data Unit (PDU) Session receives the same traffic forwarding treatment (e.g. scheduling, admission threshold).\n\nThe QFI may be dynamically assigned or may be equal to the 5G QoS Identifier (5QI). A QoS Flow may either be 'GBR', 'Non-GBR' or \"Delay Tolerant GBR\" depending on its QoS profile and it contains QoS parameters as follows:\n\n- For each QoS Flow, the QoS profile includes the QoS parameters:\n\n- 5G QoS Identifier (5QI); and\n\n- Allocation and Retention Priority (ARP).\n\n- For each Non-GBR QoS Flow only, the QoS profile can also include the QoS parameter:\n\n- Reflective QoS Attribute (RQA).\n\n- For each GBR QoS Flow only, the QoS profile also include the QoS parameters:\n\n- Guaranteed Flow Bit Rate (GFBR) - uplink (UL) and downlink (DL); and\n\n- Maximum Flow Bit Rate (MFBR) - UL and DL; and\n\n- In the case of a GBR QoS Flow only, the QoS profile can also include one or more of the QoS parameters:\n\n- Notification control;\n\n- Maximum Packet Loss Rate - UL and DL\n\nThe one-to-one mapping of standardized 5QI values to 5G QoS characteristics is specified in table 5.7.4-1 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [8] and shown below in Table 4.3.3-1.\n\n5QI values potentially

The 5G QoS model supports both:\n\n- QoS Flows that require guaranteed flow bit rate (GBR QoS Flows)\n\n- and QoS Flows that do not require guaranteed flow bit rate (Non-GBR QoS Flows).\n\nThe 5G QoS model also supports Reflective QoS (see clause 5.7.5 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [8]).\n\nA QoS Flow ID (QFI) is used to identify a QoS Flow in the 5G System. User Plane traffic assigned to the same QoS Flow within a Protocol Data Unit (PDU) Session receives the same traffic forwarding treatment (e.g. scheduling, admission threshold).\n\nThe QFI may be dynamically assigned or may be equal to the 5G QoS Identifier (5QI). A QoS Flow may either be 'GBR', 'Non-GBR' or \"Delay Tolerant GBR\" depending on its QoS profile and it contains QoS parameters as follows:\n\n- For each QoS Flow, the QoS profile includes the QoS parameters:\n\n- 5G QoS Identifier (5QI); and\n\n- Allocation and Retention Priority (ARP).\n\n- For each Non-GBR QoS Flow only, the QoS profile can also include the QoS parameter:\n\n- Reflective QoS Attribute (RQA).\n\n- For each GBR QoS Flow only, the QoS profile also include the QoS parameters:\n\n- Guaranteed Flow Bit Rate (GFBR) - uplink (UL) and downlink (DL); and\n\n- Maximum Flow Bit Rate (MFBR) - UL and DL; and\n\n- In the case of a GBR QoS Flow only, the QoS profile can also include one or more of the QoS parameters:\n\n- Notification control;\n\n- Maximum Packet Loss Rate - UL and DL\n\nThe one-to-one mapping of standardized 5QI values to 5G QoS characteristics is specified in table 5.7.4-1 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [8] and shown below in Table 4.3.3-1.\n\n5QI values potentially

the PER. NOTE 2: It is required that default MDBV is supported by a PLMN supporting the related 5QIs. NOTE 3: This MDBV value is set to 1354 bytes to avoid IP fragmentation for the IPv6 based, IPSec protected GTP tunnel to the 5G-AN node (the value is calculated as in Annex C of TS 23.060 [56] and further reduced by 4 bytes to allow for the usage of a GTP-U extension header).

                  "context": "Clause 5.7 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [8] explains the QoS model for 5G. The 5G QoS model is based on QoS Flows. The 5G QoS model supports both:\n\n- QoS Flows that require guaranteed flow bit rate (GBR QoS Flows)\n\n- and QoS Flows that do not require guaranteed flow bit rate (Non-GBR QoS Flows).\n\nThe 5G QoS model also supports Reflective QoS (see clause 5.7.5 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [8]).\n\nA QoS Flow ID (QFI) is used to identify a QoS Flow in the 5G System. User Plane traffic assigned to the same QoS Flow within a Protocol Data Unit (PDU) Session receives the same traffic forwarding treatment (e.g. scheduling, admission threshold).\n\nThe QFI may be dynamically assigned or may be equal to the 5G QoS Identifier (5QI). A QoS Flow may either be 'GBR', 'Non-GBR' or \"Delay Tolerant GBR\" depending on its QoS profile and it contains QoS parameters as follows:\n\n- For each QoS Flow, the QoS profile includes the QoS parameters:\n\n- 5G QoS Identifier (5QI); and\n\n- Allocation and Retention Priority (ARP).\n\n- For each Non-GBR QoS Flow only, the QoS profile can also include the QoS parameter:\n\n- Reflective QoS Attribute (RQA).\n\n- For each GBR QoS Flow only, the QoS profile also include the QoS parameters:\n\n- Guaranteed Flow Bit Rate (GFBR) - uplink (UL) and downlink (DL); and\n\n- Maximum Flow Bit Rate (MFBR) - UL and DL; and\n\n- In the case of a GBR QoS Flow only, the QoS profile can also include one or more of the QoS parameters:\n\n- Notification control;\n\n- Maximum Packet Loss Rate - UL and DL\n\nThe one-to-one mapping of standardized 5QI values to 5G QoS characteristics is specified in table 5.7.4-1 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [8] and shown below in Table 4.3.3-1.\n\n5QI values potentially

                  "context": "Extended reality devices are of different form factors as shown in Figure 4.8-1. These form factors may differ in processing capabilities, communication types and power consumption.\n\nThe majority of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) devices are head-mounted displays (HMDs).. In AR, the display is usually transparent and digital information is superimposed onto real life objects. In VR, the display is not transparent and only virtual information and images are displayed in front of wearer's eyes. Head-mounted display ( HMD) is a device worn over the head. It features a display in front of one or both theeyes. The display streams data, images and other information in front of the wearer's eye(s). Certain HMDs have displays over both of their users' eyes, others only have a display over one of the users' eyes.\n\nTypical components of HMDs are listed as follows:\n\nOptical systems: Display and lenses\n\nTracking sensors and possibly additional sensors\n\nCameras\n\nXR related processing (summarized as XR engine) including GPUs, CPUs, ASICs (e.g. dedicated media encoding and decoding), etc.\n\nCommunication functionalities, as for example provided by a 5G System\n\nA smartphone (defined as XR5G-P1 device type) may be used both for AR as well as for VR (together with a card-board). In both cases, typically an XR engine/runtime is available to support processing of sensor data, viewport rendering as well as SLAM processing. In this case, the 5G modem and all media/XR processing is integrated in the device. Power consumption of such devices is important, but not ultimately critical due to the onboard battery.\n\nVR HMDs typically provide the a large field of view, stereoscopic 3D imagery as well as rotational, translational and positional tracking for full 6DoF experiences. For VR, the following device types are identified:\n\nXR5G-V1 - Simple VR Display wired: Such device types are commonly available in 2019. They only include sensors for tracking as well as a display. The remaining processing is done on a remote device, e.g. a puck or a smartphone. XR/Media Processing, connectivity and power supply are provided through wired tethering.\n\nXR5G-V2 - Simple VR Display wireless: Such device types are not yet available in 2019. They include sensors for tracking, a display, a wireless connection (which could be WiFi based or 5G Sidelink based), and a power supply. The remaining processing is done on a remote device, e.g. a puck or a smartphone.\n\nXR5G-V3 - Smart VR Viewer wireless tethering: Such device types are not yet available in 2019. They include sensors for tracking, a display, a wireless connection (which could be WiFi based or 5G Sidelink based), at least some XR processing, as well as a power supply. The remaining processing is done on a remote device, e.g. a puck or a smartphone.\n\nXR5G-V4 - VR HMD standalone: Such device types are commonly available in 2019, except 5G connectivity. For such devices, the 5G modem, power supply as well as all media/XR processing is expected to be integrated into a single device.\n\nNote that XR5G-V1 and XR5G-V2 are similar in terms of functions, but the wireless connectivity creates additional challenges and may even be done by a 5G sidelink communication.\n\nAn optical head-mounted display is a type of head-mounted display that projects images and allows the user to see through its display and is used in augmented reality (AR). Unlike Virtual Reality HMDs that obscures the vision of the real world, AR devices allow to see the surroundings while streaming data and image overlays in front of the eyes. Optical head-mounted displays may cover only 1 eye or both eyes. Wearers can interact with the projected digital content through input methods such as voice commands, gestures and controllers.\n\nFor AR Glasses,  design constraints are significantly more important. In particular, design constraints apply in terms of sleekness, weight and power. The processing power is expected to be low to avoid battery consumption and thermal dissipation. Wireless AR glasses are commercially compelling. AR is typically associated to using glasses, also referred to as optical see-through. However, AR experiences may be achieved using HMDs with video-see through functionalities. A comparison of different types is for example provided in [40]. The following device types are identified:\n\nXR5G-A1 - Simple AR Wearable Glass wired: Such device types are available in 2019. They include a minimum number of sensors, possibly cameras for AR localization, as well as a display. Power, XR processing and connectivity is supplied from an external source.\n\nXR5G-A2 - Simple AR Wearable Glass wireless: Such device types are not available in 2019 and are still far out. They would include a minimum number of sensors, possibly cameras for AR localization, power supply, as well as a wireless modem for connectivity. XR processing, AR localization as well as network connectivity is provided by external means, e.g. a puck or a smartphone.\n\nXR5G-A3 - Smart AR HMD video see-through: Such device types are an initial entry for AR applications. There are much closer to XR5G-V1 type of devices, but by having cameras projecting the real world on the screen, the VR device can operate as an AR device.\n\nXR5G-A4 - AR Wearable Glass standalone: Such device types are not available in 2019 but are under consideration. For such devices, the 5G modem, power supply, as well as all media/XR processing is expected to be integrated in a single device.\n\nXR5G-A5 - Smart AR Wearable Glass wireless: Such device types are not available in 2019 and are still far out. In addition to an XR5G-A2 device, such a device would include at least a certain amount of XR/Media processing capabilities such as encoders/decoders and XRprocessing.\n\nFigure 4.8-1: XR Form Factors\n\nOne of the most important issues when considering form factors and processing is the ability of the device to dissipate power, especially when no external cooling is available. Figure 4.8-2 shows the temperature rise depending on the surface power density. As example, two points on the figure can be considered:\n\nAt 5C rise over ambient, power density that can be dissipated is 0.023 W/square inch. A smart phone whould have a surface area from 20 to 30 square inch, i.e. the power that can be dissipated is 0.5 to 0.75 Watt.\n\nAT 25C rise over ambient, power density that can be dissipated is 0.18 W/square inch. For a smartphone this would allow around 4 to 5 W continuous power dissipation. However, for an AR glass, the surface area is much smaller and so much less power can be dissipated, somewhere in the range of 1W. As an example, in a 25C room, the device enclosure surface temp would be 50C, which is already on the higher end of what is generally considered acceptable.\n\nFigure 4.8-2: Temperature rise vs. power density\n\nA summary of the different device types is provided in Table 4.8-1 along with tethering examples, placement of 5G Uu modem, XR engine and localization support, power supply and typical maximum available power. In all device types, the sensors are on the device. The table also addresses the options applicable for tethering between the device carrying the 5G Uu Modem, and the XR device, if applicable. The table also addresses options for the XR engine that includes scene recognition and viewport rendering. The following definitions for the XR engine are used:\n\nExternal: the device only supports display and receives a fully rendered viewport data that can be displayed directly. Any scene recognition, if applicable, is not on the device.\n\nSplit: the external device does a pre-rendering of the viewport based on sensor information and the device does the final rendering considering the latest sensor information. Different degrees of split exist, as discussed before. Similalrly, scene recognition can be subject to split computation.\n\nXR device: that device does the full rendering of the viewport in the device, sensor information is only processed locally. Any scene recognition, if applicable, is on the device.\n\nTable 4.8-1: XR Device Types\n\n| XR Type; Number | XR Device Type; Name                        | Tethering; Examples           | 5G Uu Modem | XR Engine Localization | Power Supply | Typical Max Avail Power |\n| XR5G-P1         | Phone                                       | n/a                           | XR device   | XR device or split     | Internal     | 3-5 W                   |\n| XR5G-V1         | Simple VR Viewer wired tethering            | USB-C                         | External    | External               | External     | 2-5 W                   |\n| XR5G-V2         | Simple VR Viewer wireless tethering         | 802.11ad/y, 5G sidelink, etc. | External    | External               | Internal     | 2-3 W                   |\n| XR5G-V3         | Smart VR Viewer wireless tethering          | 802.11ad/y, 5G sidelink, etc. | External    | XR device or Split     | Internal     | 2-3 W                   |\n| XR5G-V4         | VR HMD Standalone                           | n/a                           | XR device   | XR device or Split     | Internal     | 3-7 W                   |\n| XR5G-A1         | Simple AR Wearable Glass wired tethering    | USB-C                         | External    | External               | External     | 1-3 W                   |\n| XR5G-A2         | Simple AR Wearable Glass wireless tethering | 802.11ad/y, 5G sidelink. etc. | External    | External               | Internal     | 0.5 - 2 W               |\n| XR5G-A3         | Smart AR HMD see-through standalone         | n/a                           | XR device   | XR device or Split     | Internal     | 3-7 W                   |\n| XR5G-A4         | AR Wearable Glass standalone                | n/a                           | XR device   | XR device or Split     | Internal     | 2 - 4 W                 |\n| XR5G-A5         | Smart AR Wearable Glass wireless tethering  | 802.11ad/y, 5G sidelink. etc. | External    | XR device or Split     | Internal     | 0.5 - 2 W               |",

These form factors may differ in processing capabilities, communication types and power consumption.\n\nThe majority of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) devices are head-mounted displays (HMDs).. In AR, the display is usually transparent and digital information is superimposed onto real life objects. In VR, the display is not transparent and only virtual information and images are displayed in front of wearer's eyes. Head-mounted display ( HMD) is a device worn over the head. It features a display in front of one or both theeyes. The display streams data, images and other information in front of the wearer's eye(s). Certain HMDs have displays over both of their users' eyes, others only have a display over one of the users' eyes.\n\nTypical components of HMDs are listed as follows:\n\nOptical systems: Display and lenses\n\nTracking sensors and possibly additional sensors\n\nCameras\n\nXR related processing (summarized as XR engine) including GPUs, CPUs, ASICs (e.g. dedicated media encoding and decoding), etc.\n\nCommunication functionalities, as for example provided by a 5G System\n\nA smartphone (defined as XR5G-P1 device type) may be used both for AR as well as for VR (together with a card-board).

As an example, in a 25C room, the device enclosure surface temp would be 50C, which is already on the higher end of what is generally considered acceptable.\n\nFigure 4.8-2: Temperature rise vs. power density\n\nA summary of the different device types is provided in Table 4.8-1 along with tethering examples, placement of 5G Uu modem, XR engine and localization support, power supply and typical maximum available power. In all device types, the sensors are on the device. The table also addresses the options applicable for tethering between the device carrying the 5G Uu Modem, and the XR device, if applicable. The table also addresses options for the XR engine that includes scene recognition and viewport rendering. The following definitions for the XR engine are used:\n\nExternal: the device only supports display and receives a fully rendered viewport data that can be displayed directly. Any scene recognition, if applicable, is not on the device.\n\nSplit: the external device does a pre-rendering of the viewport based on sensor information and the device does the final rendering considering the latest sensor information. Different degrees of split exist, as discussed before. Similalrly, scene recognition can be subject to split computation.\n\nXR device: that device does the full rendering of the viewport in the device, sensor information is only processed locally. Any scene recognition, if applicable, is on the device.\n\nTable 4.8-1: XR Device Types\n\n| XR Type; Number | XR Device Type; Name                        | Tethering; Examples           | 5G Uu Modem | XR Engine Localization | Power Supply | Typical Max Avail Power |\n| XR5G-P1         | Phone                                       | n/a                           | XR device   | XR device or split     | Internal     | 3-5 W                   |\n| XR5G-V1         | Simple VR Viewer wired tethering            | USB-C                         | External    | External               | External     | 2-5 W                   |\n| XR5G-V2         | Simple VR Viewer wireless tethering         | 802.11ad/y, 5G sidelink, etc. | External    | External               | Internal     | 2-3 W                   |\n| XR5G-V3         | Smart VR Viewer wireless tethering          | 802.11ad/y, 5G sidelink, etc. | External    | XR device or Split     | Internal     | 2-3 W                   |\n| XR5G-V4         | VR HMD Standalone                           | n/a                           | XR device   | XR device or Split     | Internal     | 3-7 W                   |\n| XR5G-A1         | Simple AR Wearable Glass wired tethering    | USB-C                         | External    | External               | External     | 1-3 W                   |\n| XR5G-A2         | Simple AR Wearable Glass wireless tethering | 802.11ad/y, 5G sidelink. etc. | External    | External               | Internal     | 0.5 - 2 W               |\n| XR5G-A3         | Smart AR HMD see-through standalone         | n/a                           | XR device   | XR device or Split     | Internal     | 3-7 W                   |\n| XR5G-A4         | AR Wearable Glass standalone                | n/a                           | XR device   | XR device or Split     | Internal     | 2 - 4 W                 |\n| XR5G-A5         | Smart AR Wearable Glass wireless tethering  | 802.11ad/y, 5G sidelink. etc. | External    | XR device or Split     | Internal     | 0.5 - 2 W               |",

                  "context": "Extended reality devices are of different form factors as shown in Figure 4.8-1. These form factors may differ in processing capabilities, communication types and power consumption.\n\nThe majority of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) devices are head-mounted displays (HMDs).. In AR, the display is usually transparent and digital information is superimposed onto real life objects. In VR, the display is not transparent and only virtual information and images are displayed in front of wearer's eyes. Head-mounted display ( HMD) is a device worn over the head. It features a display in front of one or both theeyes. The display streams data, images and other information in front of the wearer's eye(s). Certain HMDs have displays over both of their users' eyes, others only have a display over one of the users' eyes.\n\nTypical components of HMDs are listed as follows:\n\nOptical systems: Display and lenses\n\nTracking sensors and possibly additional sensors\n\nCameras\n\nXR related processing (summarized as XR engine) including GPUs, CPUs, ASICs (e.g. dedicated media encoding and decoding), etc.\n\nCommunication functionalities, as for example provided by a 5G System\n\nA smartphone (defined as XR5G-P1 device type) may be used both for AR as well as for VR (together with a card-board). In both cases, typically an XR engine/runtime is available to support processing of sensor data, viewport rendering as well as SLAM processing. In this case, the 5G modem and all media/XR processing is integrated in the device. Power consumption of such devices is important, but not ultimately critical due to the onboard battery.\n\nVR HMDs typically provide the a large field of view, stereoscopic 3D imagery as well as rotational, translational and positional tracking for full 6DoF experiences. For VR, the following device types are identified:\n\nXR5G-V1 - Simple VR Display wired: Such device types are commonly available in 2019. They only include sensors for tracking as well as a display. The remaining processing is done on a remote device, e.g. a puck or a smartphone. XR/Media Processing, connectivity and power supply are provided through wired tethering.\n\nXR5G-V2 - Simple VR Display wireless: Such device types are not yet available in 2019. They include sensors for tracking, a display, a wireless connection (which could be WiFi based or 5G Sidelink based), and a power supply. The remaining processing is done on a remote device, e.g. a puck or a smartphone.\n\nXR5G-V3 - Smart VR Viewer wireless tethering: Such device types are not yet available in 2019. They include sensors for tracking, a display, a wireless connection (which could be WiFi based or 5G Sidelink based), at least some XR processing, as well as a power supply. The remaining processing is done on a remote device, e.g. a puck or a smartphone.\n\nXR5G-V4 - VR HMD standalone: Such device types are commonly available in 2019, except 5G connectivity. For such devices, the 5G modem, power supply as well as all media/XR processing is expected to be integrated into a single device.\n\nNote that XR5G-V1 and XR5G-V2 are similar in terms of functions, but the wireless connectivity creates additional challenges and may even be done by a 5G sidelink communication.\n\nAn optical head-mounted display is a type of head-mounted display that projects images and allows the user to see through its display and is used in augmented reality (AR). Unlike Virtual Reality HMDs that obscures the vision of the real world, AR devices allow to see the surroundings while streaming data and image overlays in front of the eyes. Optical head-mounted displays may cover only 1 eye or both eyes. Wearers can interact with the projected digital content through input methods such as voice commands, gestures and controllers.\n\nFor AR Glasses,  design constraints are significantly more important. In particular, design constraints apply in terms of sleekness, weight and power. The processing power is expected to be low to avoid battery consumption and thermal dissipation. Wireless AR glasses are commercially compelling. AR is typically associated to using glasses, also referred to as optical see-through. However, AR experiences may be achieved using HMDs with video-see through functionalities. A comparison of different types is for example provided in [40]. The following device types are identified:\n\nXR5G-A1 - Simple AR Wearable Glass wired: Such device types are available in 2019. They include a minimum number of sensors, possibly cameras for AR localization, as well as a display. Power, XR processing and connectivity is supplied from an external source.\n\nXR5G-A2 - Simple AR Wearable Glass wireless: Such device types are not available in 2019 and are still far out. They would include a minimum number of sensors, possibly cameras for AR localization, power supply, as well as a wireless modem for connectivity. XR processing, AR localization as well as network connectivity is provided by external means, e.g. a puck or a smartphone.\n\nXR5G-A3 - Smart AR HMD video see-through: Such device types are an initial entry for AR applications. There are much closer to XR5G-V1 type of devices, but by having cameras projecting the real world on the screen, the VR device can operate as an AR device.\n\nXR5G-A4 - AR Wearable Glass standalone: Such device types are not available in 2019 but are under consideration. For such devices, the 5G modem, power supply, as well as all media/XR processing is expected to be integrated in a single device.\n\nXR5G-A5 - Smart AR Wearable Glass wireless: Such device types are not available in 2019 and are still far out. In addition to an XR5G-A2 device, such a device would include at least a certain amount of XR/Media processing capabilities such as encoders/decoders and XRprocessing.\n\nFigure 4.8-1: XR Form Factors\n\nOne of the most important issues when considering form factors and processing is the ability of the device to dissipate power, especially when no external cooling is available. Figure 4.8-2 shows the temperature rise depending on the surface power density. As example, two points on the figure can be considered:\n\nAt 5C rise over ambient, power density that can be dissipated is 0.023 W/square inch. A smart phone whould have a surface area from 20 to 30 square inch, i.e. the power that can be dissipated is 0.5 to 0.75 Watt.\n\nAT 25C rise over ambient, power density that can be dissipated is 0.18 W/square inch. For a smartphone this would allow around 4 to 5 W continuous power dissipation. However, for an AR glass, the surface area is much smaller and so much less power can be dissipated, somewhere in the range of 1W. As an example, in a 25C room, the device enclosure surface temp would be 50C, which is already on the higher end of what is generally considered acceptable.\n\nFigure 4.8-2: Temperature rise vs. power density\n\nA summary of the different device types is provided in Table 4.8-1 along with tethering examples, placement of 5G Uu modem, XR engine and localization support, power supply and typical maximum available power.
