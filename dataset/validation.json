The eNB can configure the UE to use UDC or not. If UDC is configured for a DRB, ROHC is not used for that DRB. One byte UDC header is introduced to indicate whether the PDCP PDU is compressed by UDC or not, whether the compression buffer is reset or not, and 4 validation bits of checksum to check whether the compression and decompression buffers are synchronous. For each DRB, at most 8192 bytes compression buffer is used. If there are some errors or failure due to buffer mismatching, the eNB can send an error notification control PDU to the UE, the UE may reset the compression buffer.\n\nTo improve compression efficiency of the first few packets, two types of pre-defined dictionary can be used for UDC. One is standard dictionary for SIP and SDP signalling as defined in RFC 3485, and another is operator defined dictionary. The eNB could configure whether or which dictionary is used for a UDC DRB.\n\nUDC related capabilities are also defined in UE capability. There are three capabilities: supporting basic UDC function; supporting standard dictionary and supporting operator defined capability. If the UE supporting operator defined capability, it should also report the version of the dictionary and the associated PLMN ID to assist the eNB to identify the dictionary stored by the UE. The eNB should configure UDC according to UE capabilities.\n\nReferences",

There may be zero, one, or several uplink DPDCHs on each radio link.\n\nThe uplink DPCCH is used to carry control information generated at Layer 1. The Layer 1 control information consists of known pilot bits to support channel estimation for coherent detection, transmit power-control (TPC) commands, feedback information (FBI), and an optional transport-format combination indicator (TFCI). The transport-format combination indicator informs the receiver about the instantaneous transport format combination of the transport channels mapped to the simultaneously transmitted uplink DPDCH radio frame. There is one and only one uplink DPCCH on each radio link. The uplink DPCCH may also carry DL FET ACK/NACK signalling information for DL FET operation when DL_DCH_FET_Config = 1.\n\nThe uplink DPCCH2 is used to carry control information generated at Layer 1. The Layer 1 control information consists of known pilot bits to support channel estimation for coherent detection, and transmit power-control (TPC) commands. When DPCCH2 is configured there is one and only one uplink DPCCH2 for all radio links. When DPCCH2 is configured, the UE shall transmit DPCCH2 only in the slots in which DPCCH is transmitted.\n\nThe uplink S-DPCCH is used to carry control information generated at Layer 1. The Layer 1 control information consists of known pilot bits to support channel sounding and channel estimation for coherent detection. There is up to one uplink S-DPCCH on each radio link in the case that UL_CLTD_Enabled as defined in [5] is TRUE. Figure 1 shows the frame structure of the uplink DPDCH, the uplink DPCCH, the uplink DPCCH2 and the uplink S-DPCCH. Each radio frame of length 10 ms is split into 5 subframes, each of 3 slots, each of length Tslot = 2560 chips, corresponding to one power-control period. The DPDCH, DPCCH, S-DPCCH and DPCCH2 are always frame aligned with each other.\n\nThe parameter k in figure 1 determines the number of bits per uplink DPDCH slot. It is related to the spreading factor SF of the DPDCH as SF = 256/2k. The DPDCH spreading factor may range from 256 down to 4. The spreading factor of the uplink DPCCH, the uplink DPCCH2 and the uplink S-DPCCH is always equal to 256, i.e. there are 10 bits per uplink DPCCH/S-DPCCH/DPCCH2 slot.\n\nThe exact number of bits of the uplink DPDCH and the different uplink DPCCH fields (Npilot, NTFCI, NFBI, and NTPC) is given by table 1 and table 2. What slot format to use is configured by higher layers and can also be reconfigured by higher layers. The exact number of bits of the uplink S-DPCCH is given by table 2A.\n\nThe uplink DPCCH2 reuses slot format #1 of DPCCH, and the exact number of bits is given in table 2.\n\nThe channel bit and symbol rates given in table 1, table 2 and table 2A are the rates immediately before spreading. The pilot patterns are given in table 3 and table 4, the TPC bit pattern is given in table 5.\n\nThe FBI bits are used to support techniques requiring feedback from the UE to the UTRAN Access Point for operation of closed loop mode transmit diversity. The use of the FBI bits is described in detail in [5].\n\nThere are two types of uplink dedicated physical channels; those that include TFCI (e.g. for several simultaneous services) and those that do not include TFCI (e.g. for fixed-rate services). These types are reflected by the duplicated rows of table 2. It is the UTRAN that determines if a TFCI should be transmitted and it is mandatory for all UEs to support the use of TFCI in the uplink. The mapping of TFCI bits onto slots is described in [3].\n\nDPCCH slot format 5 is used when DL_DCH_FET_Config is configured by higher layers. In this case, over a 20ms Compression Interval (CI) consisting of 30 slots, the bits in the TFCI field carry TFCI information in the first 10 slots, and may carry an ACK/NACK indicator for DL FET in the remaining 20 slots. The ACK/NACK for DL FET is sent when DL_DCH_FET_Config = 1.\n\nIn compressed mode, DPCCH slot formats with TFCI fields are changed. There are two possible compressed slot formats for normal slot formats 0 and 2. They are labelled A and B and the selection between them is dependent on the number of slots that are transmitted in each frame in compressed mode. When DL_DCH_FET_Config is configured by higher layers, UL DPCCH slot format 5 is used in compressed mode. In compressed mode when UL_DCH_FET_Config is configured by higher layers, TFCI bits represent TFCI information in the first 10 slots that are not in compressed-mode gaps in a 20ms CI. The TFCI bits in subsequent slots that are not in the compressed mode gaps represent ACK/NACK indication for DL FET when DL_DCH_FET_Config = 1.\n\nIf UL_DTX_Active is TRUE (see [5]), the number of transmitted slots per radio frame may be less than the number shown in Table 2 and Table 2A.\n\nThe pilot bit pattern for S-DPCCH is the same as that for uplink DPCCH with Npilot = 8. The Nfixed bits in the S-DPCCH are fixed to \"10\".\n\nThe pilot bit pattern for DPCCH2 is the same as that for uplink DPCCH with Npilot = 8.\n\nThe pilot bit patterns are described in table 3 and table 4. The shadowed column part of pilot bit pattern is defined as FSW and FSWs can be used to confirm frame synchronization. (The value of the pilot bit pattern other than FSWs shall be \"1\".)\n\nThe relationship between the TPC bit pattern and transmitter power control command is presented in table 5.\n\nMulti-code operation is possible for the uplink dedicated physical channels. When multi-code transmission is used, several parallel DPDCH are transmitted using different channelization codes, see [4]. However, there is only one DPCCH per radio link, one DPCCH2 if DPCCH2 is configured and up to one S-DPCCH in the case that UL_CLTD_Enable is TRUE.\n\nA period of uplink DPCCH transmission prior to the start of the uplink DPDCH transmission (uplink DPCCH power control preamble) shall be used for initialisation of a DCH. The length of the power control preamble is a higher layer parameter, Npcp , signalled by the network [5]. The UL DPCCH shall take the same slot format in the power control preamble as afterwards, as given in table 2. When Npcp > 0 the pilot patterns of table 3 and table 4 shall be used. The timing of the power control preamble is described in [5], subclause 4.3.2.3. The TFCI field is filled with \"0\" bits.",

In order to support these charging mechanisms, the network performs real-time monitoring of resource usage on the above three levels in order to detect the relevant chargeable events. The charging levels are further described in clause 5.3.\n\nIn offline charging, the resource usage is reported from the network to the BD after the resource usage has occurred. In online charging, a subscriber account, located in an OCS or CCS, is queried prior to granting permission to use the requested network resource(s).\n\nTypical examples of network resource usage are a voice call of certain duration, the transport of a certain volume of data, or the submission of a MM of a certain size. The network resource usage requests may be initiated by the UE (MO case) or by the network (MT case).\n\nOffline and online charging may be performed simultaneously and independently for the same chargeable event. Clause 5.5 provides further insight into potential utilisation of the charging information produced by the offline and online charging mechanisms.\n\n4.1.1\tOffline charging\n\nOffline charging is a process where charging information for network resource usage is collected concurrently with that resource usage. The charging information is then passed through a chain of logical charging functions that are further explained in clause 4.3.1 and clause 4.3.3. At the end of this process, CDR files are generated by the network, which are then transferred to the network operator's BD for the purpose of subscriber billing and/or inter-operator accounting (or additional functions, e.g. statistics, at the operator's discretion). The BD typically comprises post-processing systems such as the operator's billing system or billing mediation device.\n\nIn conclusion, offline charging is a mechanism where charging information does not affect, in real-time, the service rendered.\n\n4.1.2\tOnline charging\n\nOnline charging is a process where charging information for network resource usage is collected concurrently with that resource usage in the same fashion as in offline charging. However, authorization for the network resource usage must be obtained by the network prior to the actual resource usage to occur. This authorization is granted by the OCS or CCS upon request from the network.\n\nWhen receiving a network resource usage request, the network assembles the relevant charging information and generates a charging event towards the OCS or CCS in real-time. The OCS or CCS then returns an appropriate resource usage authorization. The resource usage authorization may be limited in its scope (e.g. volume of data or duration), therefore the authorization may have to be renewed from time to time as long as the user's network resource usage persists.\n\nNote that the charging information utilized in online charging is not necessarily identical to the charging information employed in offline charging.\n\nIn conclusion, online charging is a mechanism where charging information can affect, in real-time, the service rendered and therefore a direct interaction of the charging mechanism with the control of network resource usage is required.\n\n4.1.3\tConverged charging\n\nConverged charging is a process where online and offline charging are combined. The charging information is utilized by CCS in one converged charging service which offers charging with and without quota management, as well as charging information record generation.",

I don't think it is complicated because UMTS MAC is doing more things than LTE MAC. (In terms of functionalility, I think LTE MAC is doing more than UMTS MAC). I think most of the complexity of UMTS MAC structure come from the design and the complexity of the transport channel.\nOften, things get very confusing and as a result log analysis/troubleshooting gets very tricky. Followins are the topics that will be covered in this page.\n\nAs you see in 25.321 - Figure 4.2.4.1 (Overview on MAC Layer in UTRAN), regardless of whether it is for R99, HSDPA(R5), HSUPA(R6), HSPA+ (R7), every MAC data goes through MAC-d sublayer somewhere along it's path.

But when you want to follow the uplink path, you have to read the figure from bottom to top and for downlink you have to read from top to bottom. The important thing to remember is that for R99 MAC-d is a whole of MAC layer and the MAC flow does not go through any further processing.\n\nBlue path indicate the path for HSDPA(R5) and HSPA+(R7). As you see, the data for HSDPA, HSPA+ goes through MAC-d with a very little processing and are passed to MAC-hs (HSDPA) or MAC-ehs(HSPA+) for further detailed processing. You will go back to this processing later in this section.\n\nGreen path shows the path for HSUPA, meaning this is an uplink path. You have to follow from bottom (from the point labeled 'from MAC-es/MAC-is) to top.\n\nAs you see in Figure 4.2.3.1 (Overview on MAC Layer in UE), regardless of whether it is for R99, HSDPA(R5), HSUPA(R6), HSPA+ (R7), every MAC data goes through MAC-d sublayer somewhere along it's path.

(Note that this PDU applies only to R99 MAC PDU and does not apply to HSDPA, USUPA PDU. ) This is a generic format which contains all the possible fields in the header, but depending on logical channels and mapping type, the header structure gets different. We will see the details for each specific cases in next section.\n\nThe purpose of this field is to indicate the logical channel type (class) and meaning and number of bits for this field differs depending on the logical channel type.

In this section, I will summarize the MAC PDU structures for all the possible combinations.

This will enable broader range of verticals to integrate with 3GPP systems. Currently, multiple northbound API-related specifications already exist (e.g. APIs for Service Capability Exposure Function (SCEF) defined in TS 23.682 [1], APIs for the interface between MBMS service provider and BM-SC defined in TR 26.981 [2]).\n\nFor API consumers or invokers (in particular for 3rd party API developers), a consistent and uniform API framework across multiple northbound API specifications is necessary. In 3GPP Release-15, a Common API Framework (CAPIF) was introduced to support the common API aspects (e.g. authentication, authorization, publishing, discovery, access control policy, etc.), which allows the northbound service APIs to be integrated into CAPIF, such that the API invokers can utilize a single framework for accessing and invoking the 3GPP northbound APIs.\n\nTR 23.722 [3] is a (Stage 2) technical report that analyses existing API frameworks, and identifies requirements and potential architecture solutions to support a common approach for API development within 3GPP, including recommendations for the normative work.\n\nTS 23.222 [4] specifies the (Stage 2) functional architecture model, procedures and information flows needed to support the CAPIF, and guidelines for a consistent development of northbound API (service and CAPIF APIs) in 3GPP.\n\nTS 29.222 [5] specifies the detailed (Stage 3) APIs messages and protocols needed to support CAPIF, based on the Stage 2 functional architecture.\n\nThe CAPIF functional model is illustrated in Figure 2-1. The functional model describes the CAPIF core function (CCF) and API provider domain functions i.e. API exposing function (AEF), API publishing function (APF) and API management function (AMF), and as well as the reference points between these functions and the API invoker/consumer.\n\nThe functional model as described in TS 23.222 [4], specified architecture-level procedures and information flows for common API aspects, including onboarding, offboarding, publishing, unpublishing, update of service APIs, discovery, registration, authentication, authorization, logging, auditing, monitoring, and topology hiding.\n\nIt further specified the application of the functional model to CAPIF deployments (both centralized and distributed deployment), and also CAPIF relationship with network exposure functions defined in 3GPP systems (EPS and 5GS).\n\nThe detailed API specification (Stage 3) supporting the CAPIF functional model is provided in TS 29.222 [5], which translates the procedures and interactions over the reference points into following 9 API services (8 CAPIF core function services and 1 API exposing function service):\n\nReferences\n\n11.2.2\tNorthbound APIs for SCEF - SCS/AS Interworking\n\nSummary based on the input provided by Huawei, HiSilicon in SP-171032.\n\nStarting from Rel-13, 3GPP defined the Service Capabilities Exposure Function (SCEF) framework for exposure of those 3GPP network capabilities to the application domain. However, up until Rel-15, 3GPP specified neither the SCEF functional architecture nor its interactions with Service Capability Servers or Application Servers (SCS/AS), i.e. with the application domain. 3GPP was relying on other standardization fora such as OMA or oneM2M.\n\nTriggered by interactions with oneM2M, 3GPP started with Rel-15 to specify the northbound APIs from SCEF to support oneM2M specifications to facilitate a useable end-to-end M2M architecture.\n\nThe services and capabilities offered by SCEF to Service Capability Servers or Application Servers (application domain) include:\n\nThe interface between the SCEF and the SCS/AS is referred to as \"T8\" interface. This feature specifies the architectural description (including message flows, and parameters) of the T8 interface.\n\nThe T8 interface supports offline and online charging. The charging architecture and scenarios specific to Northbound API, as well as the mapping of the common 3GPP charging architecture onto the Northbound API, are specified in TS 32.240 [2].\n\nThe Northbound API charging architecture, charging principles and scenarios, definition of charging information and content of the CDRs for offline charging are specified in TS 32.254 [3].\n\nThe corresponding AVPs and ASN.1 are specified in TS 32.298 [4] and TS 32.299 [5].\n\nReferences",

The vertical separations are the Ressource Blocks (RB), as defined in the previous section, i.e. a group of 12 subcarriers. The horizontal separations are the OFDM symbols. Four OFDM symbols together with 20 RBs form a so-called \"SS/PBCH (Synchronization Signals/ Physical Broadcast Channel) block\".\n\nThe PSS and NSS are transmitted over 127 subcarriers, i.e. about 10.5 RBs. (They are designed to carry the Physical Cell ID (PCID) selected from 1008 candidates.)\n Once synchronised with the PSS and NSS, the mobiles can retrieve the full SS/PBCH structure, and thus \"listen\" to the Physical Broadcast Channel (PBCH) and its associated Demodulation reference signals (DM-RS).\n\nThe PBCH carries only the minimum system information necessary for initial access, such as system frame number (SFN), initial configurations for PDCCH, PDSCH and DM-RS, and information required to determine the frame timing such as SS/PBCH block index and half-frame index. These are referred to as \"System Information Block 1 (SIB1)\".\n\nOne or multiple SS/PBCH blocks can be transmitted by using transmission beamforming within a half frame, with configurable periodicity from 5 ms to 160 ms. The maximum number of SS/PBCH blocks and the applicable subcarrier spacing for SS/PBCH block transmission are dependent on the frequency range, as shown in Table 5.5.4.3-1. They can be identical or different from the subcarrier spacing used for other DL transmissions.\n\nSIB1 and other system information (SIB2 and onwards) are carried by PDSCH which is scheduled by PDCCH. SIB1 contains necessary information to perform random access procedure for initial access.\n\nPaging message is carried by PDSCH which is scheduled by PDCCH. Numerology used for SIB1 transmission on a NR cell is indicated in master information block (MIB) carried by PBCH and is commonly applied to transmissions for other system information (SIB2 and onwards), Paging, Msg.2 (\"Message 2\", as explained below) and Msg.4 transmissions on the same cell.\n\nFor random access in NR, a four-step procedure consisting of Msg.1, Msg.2, Msg.3 and Msg.4 is defined. For Msg.1 i.e., PRACH transmission in random access, NR supports two types of PRACH sequences as the preamble sequence:\n\nFour different PRACH preamble formats based on the long ZC sequence are defined and corresponding numerology is defined for each PRACH preamble format as shown in Table 5.5.4.3-2.\n\nIn addition, nine different PRACH preamble formats based on the short ZC sequence are defined and corresponding numerology is defined for each PRACH preamble format as shown in Table 5.5.4.3-3.\n\nMsg.2 and Msg.4 for random access are carried by PDSCH that are scheduled by PDCCH.\n\nMsg.3 for random access is carried by PUSCH which is scheduled by random access response (RAR) in Msg.2 or PDCCH in case of retransmission.\n\nFor mobility measurement, SS/PBCH block and/or CSI-RS can be utilized in NR. SS/PBCH block based reference signal received power (RSRP), reference signal received quality (RSRQ) and signal-to-noise and interference ratio (SINR) are defined, and CSI-RS based RSRP, RSRQ and SINR are also defined. For radio link monitoring (RLM), SS/PBCH block and/or CSI-RS can be utilized as RLM reference signal in NR. One or multiple SS/PBCH blocks and/or CSI-RS resources are configured to be monitored to evaluate whether the radio link is in-sync status (i.e., in good quality) or out-of-sync status.",

The position information may be requested by and reported to a client (e.g., an application) associated with the UE, or by a client within or attached to the core network. The position information shall be reported in standard formats, such as those for cell-based or geographical co-ordinates, together with the estimated errors (uncertainty) of the position and velocity of the UE and, if available, the positioning method (or the list of the methods) used to obtain the position estimate.\n\nRestrictions on the geographic shape encoded within the 'position information' parameter may exist for certain LCS client types. The 5GS, including NG-RAN, shall comply with any shape restrictions defined in 5GS and, in a particular country, with any shape restrictions defined for a specific LCS client type in relevant national standards. For example, in the US, national standard J-STD-036-C-2 restricts the geographic shape for an emergency services LCS client to minimally either an \"ellipsoid point\" or an \"ellipsoid point with uncertainty circle\" as defined in TS 23.032 [4].\n\nIt shall be possible for the majority of the UEs within a network to use the LCS feature without compromising the radio transmission or signalling capabilities of the NG-RAN.\n\nThe uncertainty of the position measurement shall be network-implementation-dependent, at the choice of the network operator. The uncertainty may vary between networks as well as from one area within a network to another. The uncertainty may be hundreds of metres in some areas and only a few metres in others. In the event that a particular position measurement is provided through a UE-assisted process, the uncertainty may also depend on the capabilities of the UE. In some jurisdictions, there is a regulatory requirement for location service accuracy that is part of an emergency service. Further details of the accuracy requirements can be found in TS 22.071 [3].\n\nThe uncertainty of the position information is dependent on the method used, the position of the UE within the coverage area and the activity of the UE. Several design options of the NG-RAN system (e.g., size of cell, adaptive antenna technique, pathloss estimation, timing accuracy, ng-eNB and gNB surveys) shall allow the network operator to choose a suitable and cost-effective UE positioning method for their market.\n\nThere are many different possible uses for the positioning information. The positioning functions may be used internally by the 5GS, by value-added network services, by the UE itself or through the network, and by \"third party\" services. The feature may also be used by an emergency service (which may be mandated or \"value-added\"), but the location service is not exclusively for emergencies.\n\nDesign of the NG-RAN positioning capability as documented in this specification includes position methods, protocols and procedures that are either adapted from capabilities already supported for E-UTRAN, UTRAN and GERAN, or created separately from first principles. In contrast to GERAN and UTRAN but similarly to E-UTRAN, the NG-RAN positioning capabilities are intended to be forward compatible to other access types and other position methods, in an effort to reduce the amount of additional positioning support needed in the future. This goal also extends to user plane location solutions such as OMA SUPL ([15], [16]), for which NG-RAN positioning capabilities are intended to be compatible where appropriate.\n\nAs a basis for the operation of UE Positioning in NG-RAN, the following assumptions apply:",

For that, two procedures have been introduced. The first one is the MBMS bearer coordination independent on broadcasted media procedure to be used when there are multiple MC service servers serving users in one specific area covered with one MBMS bearer, but the servers broadcast media independent of each other. The second procedure is the MBMS bearer coordination within one group call. This one is used when multiple MC service servers of the same kind participate in the same group communication. The MC service servers could be different MC service servers assigned the participating role within one MC system. This feature is specified in 3GPP TS 23.280.\n\nB)\tMBMS bearer event notification: This feature includes an activation of an MBMS bearer and different types of events that may occur during the lifetime of the MBMS bearer. The different events notified to the MC service server include the MBMS bearer start result (e.g. when the first cell successfully allocated MBMS resources), including information if any cells fail to allocate MBMS resources to a specific MBMS bearer, the current status of the MBMS bearer, MBMS bearer suspension/resume or overload scenarios. This feature is specified in 3GPP TS 23.280. Further required aspects to this feature are specified in 3GPP TS 23.468, 3GPP TS 23.246 and 3GPP TS 36.300.\n\nC)\tUse of FEC to protect MBMS transmissions: Application layer FEC (Forward Error Correction) has been introduced as an optional feature to recover the packet losses when delivering a MC service over MBMS. Hence, the required level of QoS can be reached. For that, two procedures on how FEC can be applied for MBMS usage were introduced. This feature is specified in 3GPP TS 23.280. Further required aspects to this feature are specified in 3GPP TS 23.468 and 3GPP TS 23.246.\n\nD)\tHeader compression over MBMS with ROHC: Header compression can decrease the required bandwidth for service communications. Therefore, the support of ROHC (RObust Header Compression) over MBMS has been introduced as an optional feature for the MC service servers and MC service clients. If header compression and FEC are both applied to a communication over MBMS, the header compression has to be performed after the FEC encoding. For that, two procedures on how ROHC can be applied for MBMS usage were introduced. Further required aspects to this feature are specified in 3GPP TS 24.380, 3GPP TS 23.246, 3GPP TS 23.468 and 3GPP TS 36.300.\n\nReferences",

What confuse you would about 'how one technology differs from other technologies ?' or 'which technology I have to chose for my application or use model ?'\n\nThe simple answer to the question \"Which technology do I have to pick for my application or my use model ?\" is \"It depends on the nature of your application\".\n\nI know.. you would not take this as an answer. You would ask for more specific answers.\n\nIf you want to get more specific answers, you would have specific answers to a lot of specific questions as listed below. (This list would get extended as learn/observe more from various discussions/forums).\n\nI would not put my comments on each of the questions for now.. just to give you some time for you to think.. (good excuse for my laziness :)).\n\nThis is basically asking about the data rate of the end node in your IoT system. Is it collecting a simple data like Temperature, Humidity which takes up only several bytes at a time of transmission. Normally this kind of IoT device should be very low cost. It is less likely to let this kind of device to use relatively expensive network (like cellular network).\n\nThis is asking 'Are you going to use a simple sensors (like temperature, humidity) ?' or some other devices which requires a relatively large packet transmission/reception or which requires very high level data security.\n\nThis would be highly related to Q1. Usually the type of data to be collected and transmitted would determine the necessary data rate, but there might be some exceptions. For example, if you need very sophisticated data security and add a lot of additional portions to the original data to implement the security, the data rate that you would need would get much higher. Another exception can be the case where you want to upgrade/reconfigure your end-node remotely. Of course, this would not happen very often but if you really want to do this, the data rate should be pretty high for the end-node to download necessary firmware and configuration information.\n\nQ4. Does your end node device will both transmit and receive data ? or only transmit the data (no recieve) ?\n\nMost of the IoT application is Uplink centeric (transmission only in terms of end-device) and in some extreme case there are some application that is uplink only. It is understandable for most of IoT application to be Uplink dominant but there would be a lot of restriction if it goes with uplink only. For example, you have a very simple end-device (e.g, a temperature sensor) and transmitted it to a Gateway or Basestation. If the device is uplink only (transmission only), the device can only transmit the data and there is no way to verify whther it successfully reached the destination or not. To verify the successful transmission of the data, there should be some mechanism by which the destination (e.g, Gateway) can send Acknowledge message to the device that has sent the data. To do this, the system should allow downlink (i.e, reception in terms of end-device). Also, if you want to apply any form of data security or remote re-configuration or remote update, you need both uplink and downlink.\n\nLet me ask another question before this .. Are you going to use unlicensed band/frequency (i.e ISM band) or a licensed band / frequency (e.g, Cellular) ? If you decided to use ISM band, it is highly likely to use sub Ghz band (i.e, around 900 Mhz) or around 2.4 Ghz frequency. If you decided to use licensed band, it will be determined by which frequency will be allowed in the area where your IoT system will be installed.\n\nIf you selected unlicensed band, you are free to use any of the frequency .. but it is not only you who is free to use the frequency.. there might be a lot of other devices that uses the same frequency which might cause unwanted interference. If you decided to use the licensed frequency, there will be licensing / permission issue.\n\nIf the transmitter and reciever is communicating within the range of couple of meters or tens of meters, you can use many of the existing short range communication like Bluetooth, ZigBee etc. However, if it should extend to several km or tens of km, you have to use those technologies that can cover wide range like LPWAN (e.g, LoRa, SigFox etc) or Cellular technology.\n\nBasically IoT requires a cirtain type of Network structure whether it is small or large (in most case it is not peer to peer communication). Then you would have question on how to form such a network and how much control you want to have over the whole network. Some people would say 'I want to implement only the end Node(e.g, terminal sensor module) and get it connected to an exisiting network that are already established'. In this case, you would consider Cellular based IoT or SigFox. In this option, you would have less work to do but very limitted or no controllability for network. Some people would say 'I want to implement everything from the end node to the network and I want to have full control over the network'. In this case, you may like LoRa type of technology. You would have full controllability, but downside is that there are a lot of works for you to do.\n\nFor example, SKT deployed a Nation wide IoT service in South Korea around the end of 2016 based on LoRa technology. According to Ref [5], they were considering LoRa, SigFox, NB-LTE(and other LTE based IoT). LTE IoT was excluded for other reason, but between LoRa and SigFox, the controllability to Network was one of the factor to select LoRa.\n\nQ10. Do you need any security for the data being transmitted and received ? At which level, if you need ?\n\nI personally think this is pretty important issue since there are many cases where it is not easy to change / upgrade the software of a IoT end node once it is installed or take too much cost to visit every installation points and change software of the device. However, I don't see this issues widely discussed in the industry yet (as of early 2017). Probably they are afraid to bring up the issues that does not have any simple / easy solution. In theory, the smartest solution is to let the end node device itself to download the new software and upgrade it by itself. We have seen this type of software upgrade in cellular phone (smart phone) pretty commonly these days. We may think of utilizing the similar technologies to IoT devices. However, the biggest problem would be the bandwidth. Most of IoT device is designed for low data rate communication, but this kind of wireless software upgrade would take pretty big bandwidth. So if you think of this kind of wireless software upgrade, you would need to choose such a technology to provide big enough bandwidth for wireless woftware upgrade.\n\nQ12. What kind of protocol (phy, mac, application layer protocol) do you want to use ?\n\nThere are many different technologies that claim to be the best for IoT. Some of them would already be available at your time of deployment, but some technologies would be being talked a lot but not available or not mature yet. So if your deployment schedule is very near, you would need to choose a technology that are mature right now.\n\nFor example, SKT deployed a Nation wide IoT service in South Korea around the end of 2016 based on LoRa technology. According to Ref [5], they were considering LoRa, SigFox, NB-LTE(and other LTE based IoT). SigFox were excluded for other reason, but between LoRa and SigFox, LoRa was selected mainly due to availability. LoRa technology was already there when they were planning, but there were still a couple of years to go for LTE based IoT to be mature enough.\n\n[3] NarrowBand IoT Demystified: What are the benefits and why do we need it?

Release 8 was frozen in December 2008 and this has been the basis for the first wave of LTE equipment. LTE specifications are very stable, with the added benefit of enhancements having been introduced in all subsequent 3GPP Releases.\n\nLTE (Long Term Evolution) or the E-UTRAN (Evolved Universal Terrestrial Access Network), introduced in 3GPP R8, is the access part of the Evolved Packet System (EPS). The main requirements for the new access network are high spectral efficiency, high peak data rates, short round trip time as well as flexibility in frequency and bandwidth.\n\nGSM was developed to carry real time services, in a circuit switched manner (blue in figure 1), with data services only possible over a circuit switched modem connection, with very low data rates. The first step towards an IP based packet switched (green in figure 1) solution was taken with the evolution of GSM to GPRS, using the same air interface and access method, TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access).\nTo reach higher data rates in UMTS (Universal Mobile Terrestrial System) a new access technology WCDMA (Wideband Code Division Multiple Access) was developed. The access network in UMTS emulates a circuit switched connection for real time services and a packet switched connection for datacom services (black in figure 1). In UMTS the IP address is allocated to the UE when a datacom service is established and released when the service is released. Incoming datacom services are therefore still relying upon the circuit switched core for paging.\nThe Evolved Packet System (EPS) is purely IP based. Both real time services and datacom services will be carried by the IP protocol. The IP address is allocated when the mobile is switched on and released when switched off.\n The new access solution, LTE, is based on OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access) and in combination with higher order modulation (up to 64QAM), large bandwidths (up to 20 MHz) and spatial multiplexing in the downlink (up to 4x4) high data rates can be achieved. The highest theoretical peak data rate on the transport channel is 75 Mbpsin the uplink, and in the downlink, using spatial multiplexing, the rate can be as high as 300 Mbps. \nThe LTE access network is simply a network of base stations, evolved NodeB (eNB), generating a flat architecture (figure 2). There is no centralized intelligent controller, and the eNBs are normally inter-connected viathe X2-interface and towards the core network by the S1-interface (figure 2). The reason for distributing the intelligence amongst the base-stations in LTE is to speed up the connection set-up and reduce the time required for a handover. For an end-user the connection set-up time for a real time data session is in many cases crucial, especially in on-line gaming. The time for a handover is essential for real-time services where end-users tend to end calls if the handover takes too long.\n\nAnother advantage with the distributed solution is that the MAC protocol layer, which is responsible for scheduling, is represented only in the UE and in the base station leading to fast communication and decisions between the eNB and the UE. In UMTS the MAC protocol, and scheduling, is located in the controller and when HSDPA was introduced an additional MAC sub-layer, responsible for HSPA scheduling was added in the NB.\nThe scheduler is a key component for the achievement of a fast adjusted and efficiently utilized radio resource. The Transmission Time Interval (TTI) is set to only 1 ms.\nDuring each TTI the eNB scheduler shall:\n\n- consider the physical radio environment per UE. The UEs report their perceived radio quality, as an input to the scheduler to decide which Modulation and Coding scheme to use. The solution relies on rapid adaptation to channel variations, employing HARQ (Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request) with soft-combining and rate adaptation.\n- prioritize the QoS service requirements amongst the UEs. LTE supports both delay sensitive real-time services as well as datacom services requiring high data peak rates. \n- inform the UEs of allocated radio resources. The eNB schedules the UEs both on the downlink and on the uplink. For each UE scheduled in a TTI the user data will be carried in a Transport Block (TB). DL there can be a maximum of two TBs generated per TTI per UE - if spatial multiplexing is used. The TB is delivered on a transport channel. In LTE the number of channels is decreased compare to UMTS. For the user plane there isonly one shared transport channel in each direction. The TB sent on the channel, can therefore contain bits from a number of services, multiplexed together.\n\nTo achieve high radio spectral efficiency as well as enable efficient scheduling in both time and frequency domain, a multicarrier approach for multiple access was chosen by 3GPP. For the downlink, OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access) was selected and for the uplink SC-FDMA (Single Carrier - Frequency Division Multiple Access) also known as DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform) spread OFDMA (figure 3).\n\nOFDM is a multicarrier technology subdividing the available bandwidth into a multitude of mutual orthogonal narrowband subcarriers. In OFDMA these subcarriers can be shared between multiple users. The OFDMA solution leads to high Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) requiring expensive power amplifiers with high requirements on linearity, increasing the power consumption for the sender. This is no problem in the eNB, but would lead to very expensive handsets. Hence a different solution was selected for the UL. As illustrated in figure 3, the SC-FDMA solution generates a signal with single carrier characteristics, hence with a low PAPR.\nTo enable possible deployment around the world, supporting as many regulatory requirements as possible, LTE is developed for a number of frequency bands - E-UTRA operating bands- currently ranging from 700 MHz up to 2.7GHz. The available bandwidths are also flexible starting with 1.4 MHz up to 20 MHz. LTE is developed to support both the time division duplex technology (TDD) as well as frequency division duplex (FDD). In R8 there are 15 bands specified for FDD and eight bands for TTD. In R9 four bands were added for FDD. Also added in R9 were for example Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service (MBMS), and Home eNB (HeNB), see figure 4. MBMS is used to provide broadcast information to all users, for example advertisement, and multicast to a closed group subscribing to a specific service, e.g. streaming TV. HeNBs are introduced mainly to provide coverage indoors, in homes or offices.The HeNB is a low power eNB that will be used in small cells - femto cells. Normally it will be owned by the customer, deployed without any network planning and connected to the operators EPC (Evolved Packet Core).\n\n- TS 36.211 Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA); Physical channels and modulation\n- TS 36.212 Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA); Multiplexing and channel coding\n- TS 36.213 Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA); Physical layer procedures\n- TS 36.300 Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA) and Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN); Overall description; Stage 2\n- TS 36.321 Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA); Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol specification\n- TS 36.331 Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA); Radio Resource Control (RRC); Protocol specification\n- TS 36.413 Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN); S1 Application Protocol (S1AP)\n- TS 36.423 Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN); X2 Application Protocol (X2AP)\n\nThe technical paper UTRA-UTRAN Long Term Evolution (LTE) and 3GPP System Architecture Evolution (SAE) is a good starting point.\n\nInitiated in 2004, the Long Term Evolution (LTE) project focused on enhancing the Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (UTRA) and optimizing 3GPP's radio access architecture.\n\nThe 3GPP 36 series of specifications, covers the \"Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA)\".\n\nSee also - the technologies page on LTE-Advanced, which describes the work beyond LTE Release 8/9.",

This is mainly designed to use LTE for M2M (Machine to Machine) or IoT (Internet of Things). Usually these application requires not that much throughput (in most case it needs very low throughput).\n\nWhy do you need this kind of special technique ? Does this mean that current LTE cannot achieve such a low throughput ?\n\nOf course there is no problem with the current LTE to work for such a low throughput application. But the issue is not with the low throughput, but with some other constraints. In practical point of view, this kind of application would need following characterstics.\n\nAs I said there is no problem with achieving Low Throughput with the current LTE implementation, but there would be limitation to achieve Low Cost, Low Energy Consumption as required in this area (Actually Low Throughput itself is not a goal of the design. It is more like a result of design/implementation that meets MTC criteria illustrated below.\n\nThen how to achieve these critical requirement. The easies way we can think of is to reduce the complexity of LTE and this is the main motivation of MTC and it is one of major topics in Rel 13. I think this would be more important feature/topic in 5G than in 4G (Current LTE).\n\nYou may say 'item i) and ii) has been supported from the day 1 of LTE. So we don't have to do anything (effort /changes) on network side ?'\n\nOnly in terms of throughput in a good signal condition, you may say like it. But with BW 1.4 and single antenna, it is very difficult to apply techniques to improve the reliable data connection (e.g, Spatial Diversity, Frequency Diversity etc). So we may need to change some specification to compensate this restriction.\n\nAlso, we may need to change some lower layer specification due to item iii) as well.\n\nAs of now (Apr 2015), no TS document yet, but you can get pretty details information from following documents.\n\nNow (as of Rel 13) we can see the real implementation of these criteria because LTE MTC specification is released. See how these general criteria turns into reality in LTE : LTE BL/CE (M1) and LTE NB pages.\n\n[2] TR 36.888 - Study on provision of low-cost Machine-Type Communications (MTC) User Equipments (UEs) based on LTE",

    "context": "https://www.sharetechnote.com/html/Handbook_LTE_Fading.html\n\nComm. Tech.: Fading\n\nIntuitive understanding of Fading would be simple, but the detailed description is pretty difficult and would be even more difficult to understand the details without going through the complicated mathematical process. This page would start with Intuitive description and try to keep adding the details one by one. It will take long time to complete the pages and will split this into multiple pages if it goes too long.\n\nIn most of the wireless communication environement, a signal out of a transmitter radiate into wide direction and these radiated signal takes different path and arriving at the reciever at different timing and with different signal strength(amplitude). As a result, the signal coming into the reciever is the composite of all the components. As you may learned in high school physics, when thetwo\ncopies of the signal get combined the resulting signal can be an augmented signal or attenuated signal depending on whether the two signal constructively combined or destructively combined.\n\nThen what determines whether the signals constructively combine or destructively combine ? The answer also come from high school physics. The phase of the two signal determines whether the signal constructively combine or destructively combine.\n\nIn wireless communication environment, many copies of the signals get combined at the reciever side and some of them constructively combines and some of them destructively combines. So final result of combination of all the incoming signals become very complicated and the combined signal becomes drastically different from the original signal tranmitted from the source. In most case, the quality\nof the combined signal at the reciever gets poorer (deteriorated) than the original signal. This kind of process of signal deterioration by the multiple propogation path of a signal is called 'Fading'. When we say \"Fading\", it usually implies \"Signal quality gets bad\".\n\nFor more intuitive unerstanding of the fading, I will show you a couple of different aspect of fading you can mesure using various equipments.\n\nFirst, let's compare a faded signal and non-faded signal using a spectrum analyzer. You would get the two results as follows and you will see the highly fluctuating amplitude across the channel bandwidth. (Note : These two capture are not the one from the same signal, so comparing the absolute value of the amplitude does not make any sense. Just take the image of overall amplitude profile).\n\nNow let's look at how the fading influence the signal quality decoded by the reciever. Look at the following samples of constellation for faded and non-faded signal.\n\nNow let's get into even further and I think this is the thing that you would be most interested in. How this fading would influence the final performance. Following graph shows the data rate at PHY layer and PDCP layer. The plot showing at the top (labeled as 'PHY Transmission Rate') is the amount of data being transmitted per second by PHY layer of the transmitter. The plot in the middle\n(labeled as 'PHY throughput with HARQ ACK' is the amount of data getting ACKED per second from the reiever PHY layer. You see there is pretty much gap between the two plots. It means that a considerable portions of the data were failed to get properly decoded by the reciever and the reciever sent NACK for the data. Normally in this case, the transmitter PHY layer retransmits the previous data rather than moving into the next step of the transmission.\n\nThe plot at the bottom (labelled as 'PDCP Transmission Rate') is the amount of data being sent to the lower layer from the transmitter's PDCP layer. You will see another gap here. It is not easy to explain exactly what is causing this gap. In this case, some portions of the gap would come from the overhead of higher layer data structure but majority of the gap would be because PDCP cannot\npush the data down to the lower layer since PHY layer is too busy with retransmitting the previous data rather than transmitting the new data coming from the higher layer.\n\nThere are many factors generating Fading effect. Followings are the list of components (factors) of fading we can think of.\n\nTo study on fading requires the detailed understanding of each of these components. If I express some major components in visual form, it can be presented as follows. Just from the high level view, you should see some typtical pattern from this representation. First notice that the horizontal axis represents 'Distance in Linear Scale'. You may have seen a lot of different plots in various\ntextbook and get confused by those. One of the first step to remove those confusion would be clearly understanding the meaning of axis of the graph. Even for the same things, you would see different shape of plots if you define the meaning of the axis differently. One of the factors from various text confusing you the most is the scale of each axis. For example, in case of path loss graph in some textbook where they represent the axis in log scale you would see a straight line, but in this page you\nare seeing a kind of negative exponential graph since the axis is represented in linear scale.\n\nPath loss is just gradually decreases but not much of fluctuation. In the second plot, you see some fluctuation of the signal strength but the fluctuation frequency over the distance is not that high. In the third plot, you see fluctuations of signal strength and the fluctuation frequency is also pretty high.\n\nWhen you observe a real received signal, you wouldn't see these factors in separate form as in the graph on the left side. What you see at the real reciever is the result of summation of all the factors and it is like the graph on the right side.\n\nProbably the words you might have heard the most frequently when you talking about fading would be 'Fast Fading', 'Slow Fading'. Intuitively it sounds simple. But not easy to find clear/technical defintion for these. How fast it should be to be Fast Fading ? How slow it should be to be Slow Fading ?\n\nI found a very good definition and technical explanation from the reference [2]. It states as follows:\n\nFast Fading is used to describe channels in which Channel Coherence Time < Tansmission Symbol Time. Fast Fading describes a condition where the time duration in which the channel behaves in a correlated mannel is short compared to the time duration of a symbol. Therefore, it can be expected that the fading characteristic of the channel will change several times while a symbol is propagating, leading to distortion of the baseband pulse shape. Analogous to the distortion described as ISI, the distortion take place because the recieved signal's components are not all highly correlated throughout time. Hence, fast fading can cause the baseband pulse to be distorted, resulting in a loss of SNR that often yields an irreducible error rate. Such distorted pulses cause synchronization problems (failure of phase-locked-loop recievers), in addition to difficulties in adequately defining a matched filter.\n\nSlow Fading is used to describe channels in which Channel Coherence Time > Tansmission Symbol Time. Here, the time duration that the channel behaves in a correlated manner is long compared to the time duration of a transmission symbol. Thus, one can expect the channel state to virtually remain unchanged during the time in which a symbol is transmitted. The propaging symbols will likely not suffer from the pulse distortion. The primary degradation in a slow-fading channel, as with flat fading, is loss in SNR.\n\nPath Loss and Shadowing may not be considered to be a part of Fading in narrow sense, but it can be considered as a factor causing the fading in wider sense. Understanding or Modeling the path loss is not that difficult. You may see a mathematical model which you were faimilar with in your high school math. The famous format of anti-proportional to 'something squared'.\n\nModling for Path Loss is done with the respect to the distance between a transmitter and receiver. The key question is ..\n\nTest A) When a transmitter antenna is transmitting a certain (fixed) amount of energy and you put a measurement antenna which is a certain distance (let's call this distance as 'd') and measure the received(measured) energy. Once you get the value at a certain 'd', write down the value. And then move the reciever antenna a little bit further and do the same measurement and write down\nthe value. Repeat this process as you move 'd' further and further and collect all the measured value and plot it on the graph with horizontal axis = d and vertical axis = measured energy level (power). How would the plot look like ? Can you come up with an equation to represent the graph ?\n\nTest B) Now let's try a little bit different type of measurement. This time, draw a circle with radius d with the transmitter antenna at the center. and then put several antenna along the circumference and measure the received power at each antenna and plot the value with horizontal axis = location of receiver antenna and vertical axis = measured energy level (power). How would the\nplot look like ?\n\nTest C) Now let's think about two test environment. In one setup there is no obstacles between the reciever and transmitter antenna (Let's call this as 'Setup A'). In the other setup, there are a lot of obstacles (like building, tree, houses, mountain etc) between the transmitter antenna and reciever antenna (Let's call this as 'Setup B'). Then you do the measurement described in Test\nB) for both setup and compare the result. Would you see any difference ? what kind of difference would you see ?\n\nThese three test will be used as a basis for modeling following cases. (Details will come later)\n\nThe first thing we can think of is a kind of ideal case called 'Free Space'. In this case, we assume that there is no obstacles between the transmitter and reciever antenna.\n\nIn this case, the measured power at every reciever antenna at the same distance from the transmitter antenna would be same and the received signal power can be modeled as follows. (Basically this equation is a form of Frris' Transmission Equation )\n\nIf you want to convert this equation to a form which most of RF engineers are more familiar with (dBm scale), you can just apply 10 log( ) on both side and go through following steps. Of course, you don't have to memorize the each of these steps. Just try to understand overall concept and logic of this process.\n\nLife would be much easier if the condition between the transmission antenna and reciever antenna is always as decribed in previous case (Free Space).\n\nIn real life situation, it is highly likely that you would see a lot of obstacles (like building, Tree, mountain etc). If I draw this situation in a little bit simplified way, it would be as follows.\n\nThe path loss at a certain distance can be expressed as follows. Compare this with the free space case. What kind of difference do you see ?\n\nIn case of free space model, once the distance is determined the received power can be determined automatically meaning that if d is fixed(same), you would get the same measured value (recieved power) for every measurement. But in this case, you cannot gurantee the same measured value even though the distance is same. Even though d is same, you would get the different measured value if beta\n(Path Loss Exponent) is different or epsilon (Random Variable) is different.\n\nThen the question would be 'How the Path Loss Exponent and Random Variable is determined ?'. There is no strict theory that can determine these values deterministically. It is usually determined empirically. According to various researches,\n\nIf you apply Log (10 log[ ] more specifically) to both side, you can get a linear equation in dB (dBm) scalse as shown below.\n\nA defining characteristic of the mobile wireless channel is to build up a mathematical model for the variations of the channel strength over time and over frequency. There are mainly two factors influencing the variations of the channel strength as listed below.\n\nAs a starting point, please... please ... please ... read very carefully about the section of Signal Presentation, Impulse Response and Convolution section before you go deeper into this section.\n\nLet's suppose we have a case as shown below. A UE is communicating with a eNodeB and there is a lot of building between the UE and the eNodeB. You may intuitively guess the eNodeB would get the multiple copies of the same signal from UE because the same signal can reach the eNodeB via multiple path as shown below. Let's assume that we have four different path as shown below. There are two\nmajor characteristics of the paths. One is attenuation and the other one is time delay. Of course there would be several additional factors, but these two components would be the largest factors. Let's assume that each of the path has the delay and attenuation as shown below.\n\nHow do we represent a channel using these delay and attenuator factor ? There can be a couple of different ways to represent it, but one of the most common way would be to represent it as an impulse response model. Even though you may not familiar with the term 'impulse response', you may have seen this kind of description if you have any experience of using channel simulators (fader) and\ndealt with fading profile. Following is the graphical representation of impulse response of the four paths in this example and physical meaning of it. I hope this make sense to you.\n\nIf you represent this impulse response into a mathematical form, it become as follows. If you are not familiar with this kind of mathematical representation. Read again the section of Signal Representation. (When you are first learning this way of signal representation.. you may think .. what the hell is delta function\n? Why we need this kind of function ? etc... this is one example why you need to learn those textbook concept).\n\nLet's look into a example that (hopefully) would give you more concrete understanding of these concepts.\n\nLet's suppose that a signal goes through six different path (multipath) as indicated in plot (1). Horizontal axis represents the time delay from the transmission to arrival at the reciever antenna. Vertical axis indicates the amplitude of the received signal. plot(2)~(7) shows the signal going through each path reaching to Rx antenna. If you look at each plots, you would notice that the phase\n(time delay) and amplitude are different from each other. plot (8) shows the summation of all the plots from (2) through (6). This is the signal being sensed by the recieving antenna.\n\nWhat do you observe from the plot (8) (the sum of all the multipath signal) ? You would notice that the amplitude and phase gets different from the transmitted signal, but overall shape of the signal is same as the transmitted signal. It means that no distortion happened by this multipath.\n\nNow let's think of how the received signal is influenced by the multipath with the frequency of the transmitted signal. I created plots for three different frequency (In this case, the amplitude of transmitted signal are same for all frequencies). As you see at plot (8) of each case (w=1,2,5), the amplitude of the total received signal gets different depending on frequency.\n\nNote : This shows the cases of only three different frequencies. Isn't there any way of showing the amplitude of total received signal for all the different frequencies in easier way ? We will look into this shortly.\n\nFollowing is the Octave source code (I think this would work with Matlab as well) for the graphs shown above, try playing the list 'a' and 'tau', get some intuitive understanding on your own.\n\nplot(t,real(exp_iwt)); xlim([0 2]);ylim([-1 1]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[-1 0 1]);\n\nplot(t,imag(exp_iwt)); xlim([0 2]);ylim([-1 1]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[-1 0 1]);\n\nplot(t,real(exp_iwt_sum),'r-'); xlim([0 2]);ylim([-3 3]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[-3 0 3]);\n\nplot(t,imag(exp_iwt_sum),'r-'); xlim([0 2]);ylim([-3 3]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[-3 0 3]);\n\nplot(w,real(Hw)); xlim([0 wmax]);ylim([-1 1]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[-1 0 1]);\n\nplot(w,imag(Hw)); xlim([0 wmax]);ylim([-1 1]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[-1 0 1]);\n\nplot(w,abs(Hw)); xlim([0 wmax]);ylim([0 1]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[0 1]);\n\nplot(w,real(Hw_sum),'r-'); xlim([0 wmax]);ylim([-5 5]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[-5 0 5]);\n\nplot(w,imag(Hw_sum),'r-'); xlim([0 wmax]);ylim([-5 5]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[-5 0 5]);\n\nplot(w,abs(Hw_sum),'r-'); xlim([0 wmax]);ylim([0 5]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[0 5]);\n\nNow we have a channel described in the form of impulse response. Let's suppose that we have a signal x(t) going through the channel. The x(t) will split into multiple pathes in the channel and take the different route and finally recombine at the receiver antenna. What would the signal at the receiving antenna look like ? There is an excellent mathematical tool to give you the answer to this\nquestion. It is a tool called 'Convolution'. If you just take the convolution of channel impulse response and input signal (x(t)), you would take the signal at the receiving antenna.\n\nWhen we specify a Fading Channel profile, we are usually given a table with tap delay and relative power for each tap. You may visualize the table as shown below. Usually those profile table in the specification does not specify statistical information for the tap, but usually some specific statistical profile is associated with each tap. In case of LTE channel profile (Tap Delay Line : TDL), usually each tap is associated with statistical power profile as shown below. Usually the first tap indicates the fading on line of sight path that is modeled in Rician distribution and the remaining taps indicates the fading channel on non line of sight path that is modeled in Rayleigh distribution.\n\nWhen it comes to using this channel profile in fading implementation, I would take this as the impulse response of the fading channel. Then, the modeling of a signal passing through a fading channel can be represented as the convolution of signal and the fading channel as illustrated below.\n\nSound simple ? Yes simple conceptually, but there is a difficulties in reality. It is about how to apply the statistically property associated with each tap.\n\nEach tap is associated with a specific statistical power and doppler profile. It mean that the power for each tap for each steps of convolution changes and the frequency shift for each tap for each steps of convolution changes according to specific statistical profile as illustrated below.\n\nApplying these changing impulse response, the faded signal is generated as illustrated below. (In real implementation, there are various techniques are used to generate this kind of varing channel impulse response. One widely used mathology is to use Jake's model).\n\nIn addition to this delay, gain, PDF, we have to think about the correlations among all the antenna on transmitter and reciever side as follows.\n\nThese correlation is defined in 3GPP as shown below and this correlation matrix should be applied to the Fading model when we use multiple antenna configuration.\n\nDo you see any difference between the matrix shown above (channel matrix) for 2 x 2 MIMO and the correlation matrix as shown below for 2 x 2 case ?\n\nOne obvious difference is size of the matrix. The channel matrix shown above is 2x2 matrix and the correlation matrix for 2 x 2 case shown below is 4x4.\n\nAny idea on how the 2x2 matrix show above is converted to 4 x 4 matrix shown below ?\n\n(The full correlation matrices is obtained by Tensor Product/Kronecker product\nof two antenna correlation matrix)\n\nLet's start with the simplest case and add piece by piece until we reach more realistic (complex) cases.\n\nLet's suppose that you have two Tx antenna and one Rx antenna. If draw this situation as in channel model, you can draw this setup as follows. (Let's call this a Case A)\n\nIn this setup, you have two channel path(channel coefficient) h1 and h2. Now let's think about all the possible relation between these two channel. If you draw all the possible relationships as a diagram, you may represent as follows.\n\nIf you represent these relationship between the two channel path (channel coefficient) in a matrix format, you can represent it as follows. (I would not explain it in detail but you would need to have some intuitive understanding of vector/matrix. This is why you should have taken such a boring linear algebra course in the university. If you are really new to this vector/matrix concept,\nVector/Matrix page on this site). Be careful, you may get confused with 2 x 2 matrix to be used to model 2 x 2 MIMO channel. (At least I was confused a lot at the beginning. I would not talk too much about it, but I strongly recommend you to compare the two matrix and clearly understand the difference between them). Just to give you the conclusion about the difference between the two matrix, the matrix shown\nhere represents the correlation between each channel path(the path the signal flow through) and the matrix shown in channel model represents the correlation between Tx and Rx antenna.\n\nThe 'Beta' value represents the cross correlation between channel coefficient h1 and h2.\n\nNow we have a different case. In this case, you have two Tx antenna and one Rx antenna. If draw this situation as in channel model, you can draw this setup as follows. (Let's call this a Case B)\n\nIf you represent these relationship between the two channel path (channel coefficient) in a diagram, you can represent it as follows.\n\nIf you represent these relationship between the two channel path (channel coefficient) in a matrix format,, you can represent it as follows.The 'Alpha' value represents the cross correlation between channel coefficient h1 and h2.\n\nNow let's look into more complicated case. In this case, you have two transmitter antenna and two reciever antenna. The antenna and channel path can be illustrated as follows. You can think of this as a combination of Case A and Case B described above.\n\nNow if you represents the correlations between each of these channel coefficients, it can be represented as follows.\n\nAs you did in case A and B, if you represents these correlations in vector/matrix format, you would get a big matrix as follows. How did you get the last matrix ?. Actually it came from the matrix for Case A and B described above. If you clearly understood the meaning of Beta and Alpha in Case A and B, you would easily understand how each of the elements in this big matrix can be represented\nas 'Alpha' or 'Beta'.\n\nwhat about the '?' part shown above ? Filling out these '?' is not so straigtforward. If you brow the statical concept (I cannot explain though :)), those parts are the places where the correlation between part of Case A and part of Case B and can be filled as follows.\n\nHow to derive MIMO coeifficient matrix mathematically from Diversity coefficient matrix ?\n\nI have explained how we got 2x2 MIMO correlation matrix from physical perspective and the each elements of 2 x 2 MIMO matrix can be derived from the elements of 2x1 Diversity matrix. I strongly recommend you to try to get familiar with this concept and build your own intuition. But as the number of antenna increases, deriving all the correlation matrix as I described above would not be that\neasy. Fortunately there is a mathematical way of deriving the MIMO correlation matrix from Diversity Correlation matrix. The MIMO correlation matrix can be derived by taking Kronecker product of two Diversity matrix as shown below. (If you are not familar with the concept of Kronecker product, refer to this page)\n\nThe last component I want to show you about Fading is Doppler spread. Doppler spread is caused by the well known phenomenon called 'Doppler Shift' (I would not explain what Doppler shift is. Everybody would learned about this from High school physics and you can easily google out a lot of explanation of this effect).\n\nDoppler spread can be expressed as shown in following function and plot. If you think of 'Doppler spread' as a kind of filter (or a block in a control system model). You can take the following function as a kind of transfer function of the filter.\n\nAs you see, how much a frequency (fc) get spreaded by doppler spread is indicated by fm. If you see another formula below the graph representing fm, you would see fm is determined by the velocity of object (relative velocify between transmitter and reciever) and speed of light and fc(carrier frequency). You know fc is constant (set by standard and assume hardware is good enough to maintain\nthe fc the same). Now the only variable is the speed v. According to this equation, fm and v are in proportional relation, meaning if v gets higher, fm gets larger (the width of the graph gets wider) and if v gets smaller, fm gets smaller (the width of the graph gets narrower).\n\nHow this kind of plot is obtained ? What is the meaning of this plot. Let's think a little bit further into how we get this plot.\n\nLet's assume that a car (e.g, a phone in a car) is moving in horizontal direction and it is receiving a signal with an angle illustrated as in (A). Since the car is moving, the phone in the car would experience doppler shift. Since the UE is getting the signal with an angle, the doppler shift it percieves can be represented as in red arrow in (B).\n\nNow let's extend this situation further to the situation where the UE in the moving car is receiving the signal from all direction as illustrated below. This is the situation where the UE has so many reflectors around it and recieves the multipath signal all around. Then the doppler shift that UE percieves is like red dots marked on the horizontal line. If you plot those red dots in probability distribution function, you will get the red plot as shown below.\n\nNow you may have question. How differently the narrow Doppler spread and wide doppler spread affect on the signal ?\n\nThe simulation result for these two cases (narrow and wide doppler spread) is shown below. The upper track is for narrow doppler spread and the lower track is for wide doppler spread. As you see, you see much frequency energy fluctuation over time in wide Doppler spectrum. I will update the page later about the mathmatical background.\n\nIf you are using a phone in high speed train, the distance between UE and eNB changes very fast. It means both UE and eNB will be under drastic doppler shift.\n\nFor example, let's suppose the train is traveling right into the eNB as illustrated below (the eNB is right on top of the railway). Of course, you don't see this kind of situation in real life. The train will crash into the eNB in this case. However, just suppose this is possible and train can go through a ghost-like eNB. In this case and assume that the speed of the train is constant, the doppler shift will stay constant as well. The only change is the direction of frequency shift changes as the train pass through eNB as illustrated below.\n\nHowever, in realy you don't see any case shown above in real life. In real life, the eNB is located away from the rail way at certain distance.\n\nIn this case, the Doppler Shift changes as the train get closer to, pass by and farther away from the eNB. The doppler shift at a specific time is represented as shown below (36.101 B.3)\n\nWhere does this equation come from ? It turned out to be from hunior high school geometry, but it took me long time to understand this since there is no background information in 3GPP.\n\nThis model is based on the assumption that the eNBs are spaced equaly and the train moves at a constant speed. It is also assumed that the initial location of the train (the location at t = 0) on the railway is at the mid point between two adjacent eNBs as shown below. Dmin is defined as the closest possible distance between UE and eNB and the initial location is specified to be half way between two adjacent eNBs. Then, the distance between the eNB and the train can be derived. If we define the angle theta as shown below, the cos(theta) will become as below.\n\nNow let's look into a snapshot after t seconds. Now the location of the train on the railway and the distance between UE and eNB, and the cos(theta) is derived as shown below. (Just try to derive on your own or just copy it with a pen on a paper, you will understand it clearly).\n\nIf you plot the doppler shift with time as traing travel along the railway, it would be illustrated as shown below.\n\nFollowing is the Matlab code that I wrote based on the equation shown above. In this, I calculated not only frequency shift but also the angle(theta) to figure out the location of the train more easily.\n\nNow let's do some experiment with the code to understand the impact of the parameters. The first experiment is to change the speed of the train keeping all other parameters same. The doppler shift that UE (on the train) will experience can be plotted as shown below. See if this is aligned with your intuitive understanding.\n\nNow let's do another experiement. In this experiement, I changed Dmin keeping all other parameters same. The doppler shift that UE (on the train) will experience can be plotted as shown below. See if this is aligned with your intuitive understanding.\n\nTypical model for Fading channel can be described by a simple diagram as follows. This is very simplified model but fortunately this is almost enough for 3GPP specification for fading test. As you see, a signal comes into the fading block and splits into multiple path. Each path has three components, namely Delay, PDF, Gain component. By changing these parameters in each path,\nyou can construct pretty complicated fading channel.\n\nIn LTE 3GPP specification, typical three types of Fading profiles are defined as follows.\n\nGo through following pages (examples) and try to get some intuitive understanding on your own.\n\n[2] Rayleigh Fading Channels in Mobile Digital Communication Systems.

It is extremly simple and lightweight messaging protocol based on publish / subscribe mechanism.\n\nIn case of current high bandwidth connection (like ordinary internet, WiFi, Cellular), we already have so wide varieties of protocols like http, ftp, sip etc. Most of these protocols is generating relatively large traffic even though it can be considered as almost nothing with recent broadband communication technology and it would not be a big issue even with IoT devices if the devices is based on celluar network (e.g, WCDMA or LTE). However, this kind of protocol can cause untolerable amount of traffic for the devices that is based on very low throughput and small sized packet system like 6LoWPAN. For this kind of low throughput/small packet based system, we would need very light , simple and small sized application layer protocol. MQTT is one of the most popular protocol that meets this requirement.\n\nFor learning any kind of protocol, my personal approach is almost always same. To understand the packet (or frame) structure and then following through a couple of example protol sequences line by line. Sometimes I practice decoding the captured hex stream by hand based on Packet Structure specification. I will do the same thing here.\n\nProtocol Sequence of MQTT is very simple as illustrated below. First, Client (IoT End Device) request connection to a Broker (a kind of server). If the connection accepted, the device (client) would send 'SUBSRIBE' message saying \"I want to get this and this kind of data. So please send me the data whenever those data is upadated on your side (Broker)\". If this request is accepted by Broker, the broker would send the data to the device whenever any new data comes into the database. For more details on profocol sequence, see 'Protocol Sequence' section. For more details on the structure and contents of each message, refer to Packet structure section.\n\nEven though the description and examples came from myself, the packet structure shown here is based on MQTT V3.1 Protocol Specification by International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) Eurotech. Format representation is modified a little bit for easier understanding for myself.\n\nFollowing is one example protocol sequence that I captured from my trial with HiveMQ Websocket Client. You may get a little bit different variations if you try on your own, but overall procedure and message structure would be similar to the example shown here. Give it a try on your own and you will get used to it very quickly. MQTT is one of the simplest protocol you can see in wireless communication area and I think this would be the biggest reason why MQTT is adopted as one of the dominant protocols in IoT.\n\nYes, Try with HiveMQ Websocket Client. This is what I used to capture the most of sample log for this page.",

    "context": "https://www.3gpp.org/technologies/keywords-acronyms/105-son\n\nSON\n\nSON solutions can be divided into three categories: Self-Configuration, Self-Optimisation and Self-Healing. The SON architecture can be a centralized, distributed or a hybrid solution.\n\nThis is the dynamic plug-and-play configuration of newly deployed eNBs. The eNB will by itself configure the Physical Cell Identity, transmission frequency and power, leading to faster cell planning and rollout.\n\nThe interfaces S1 and X2 are dynamically configured, as well as the IP address and connection to IP backhaul. To reduce manual work ANR (Automatic neighbour relations) is used. ANR configures the neighbouring list in newly deployed eNBs and is optimizing the list configuration during operation.\n\nDynamic configuration includes the configuration of the Layer 1 identifier, Physical cell identity (PCI) and Cell global ID (CGID). There are 504 different PCIs available in LTE, the PCI mapping shall fulfill the collision free condition as well as the confusion free. The PCI can be assigned either in a centralized or distributed way.\n\nWhen centralised assignment is used the OAM system will have a complete knowledge and control of the PCIs. When the distributed solution is used the OAM system assigns a list of possible PCIs to the newly deployed eNB, but the adoption of the PCI is in control of the eNB. The newly deployed eNB will request a report, sent either by User Equipment (UEs) over the air interface or by other eNBs over the X2 interface, including already in-use PCIs, see figure 1. - The eNB will randomly select its PCI from the remaining values.\n\nANR is used to minimize the work required for configuration in newly deployed eNBs as well as to optimize configuration during operation. Correct and up-to-date neighbouring lists will increase the number of successful handovers and minimize the number of dropped calls. Before a handover can be executed the source eNB requires the neighbouring information: PCI and CGID of the target eNB.\n\nThe PCI is included in every normal measurement report. The mapping between the PCI and CGID parameters can be done by using information from the OAM or reported by UEs decoding the target cell CGID on the broadcast channel in the target cell, see figure 2. The capability of decoding CGID is an optional UE feature.\n\nA network operator can put a cell on a ANR black list, to block certain handover candidates, for example from indoor to outdoor cells. 3GPP has also specified LTE Inter-Frequency and Inter-RAT (Radio Access Technology) ANR.\n\nFunctions for self-optimisation are mainly included in Release 9. It includes optimisation of coverage, capacity, handover and interference.\n\nMobility load balancing (MLB) is a function where cells suffering congestion can transfer load to other cells, which have spare resources. MLB includes load reporting between eNBs to exchange information about load level and available capacity.\n\nThe periodicity of the reporting can be requested in the range of 1 to 10 s. The report can contain, hardware load, S1 transport network load and Radio resource status. The Radio resource status reports are separated in Up Link and Down Link reports, including the total allocation guaranteed and non-guaranteed bit rate traffic, the percentage of allocated Physical Resource Block (PRB) and the percentage of PRBs available for load balancing.\n\nMLB can also be used between different Radio Technologies. In case of inter-RAT the load reporting RAN Information Management (RIM) protocol will be used to transfer the information via the core between the base stations of different radio technologies. A cell capacity class value, set by the OAM-system, will be used to compare and weigh the different technologies radio capacities against each other.\n\nA handover due to load balancing is carried out as a regular handover, but it may be necessary to amend parameters so that the User Equipment (UE) does not return to the congested cell. The amendment must take place in both cells, so that the handover settings remain coherent in both. The eNBs need to estimate how much the cell border needs to be shifted, expressed in dB, to avoid a quick return of the UE.\n\nMobility robustness optimization (MRO) is a solution for automatic detection and correction of errors in the mobility configuration. In Release 9 the focus is on errors causing Radio link failure (RLF) due to too late or early handover, or handover to an incorrect cell.\n\nIn case of late handover, see figure 3, the handover procedure in the source cell is initialized too late, since the UE is moving faster than the Handover (HO) parameter settings allow. Hence when the RRC HO command from the serving cell is transmitted the signal strength is too weak to reach the UE, now located in the target cell, connection is lost. The UE attempts a connection re-establishment, containing PCID and C-RNTI belonging to the source cell, but received by the target cell. The target eNB will then inform the source cell about RLF to adjust Handover parameters.\n\nIt is a bit more complicated to detect a too early handover, see figure 4. The UE has successfully been handed over from source cell A to target cell B, but since it was triggered too early the connection will drop almost immediately due to too poor radio conditions in the target cell B. The UE will then try to re-establish the connection, which will now take place in the original source cell, cell A, since this cell is the strongest one. The UE will use the PCID and RNTI from the target cell B and the source cell A will then consider this as a Radio Link Failure due to too late handover and send an indication to the target cell B. But the target cell B will now recognize the parameters in the indication, as given to a mobile that had just completed a handover to cell B from cell A now indicating failure. The target cell B will send back a report about too early Handover to adjust Handover parameters, to the source cell A.\n\nIn order to save energy some cells can be switched off when capacity is not needed. The power consumption in a base station is not only related to load, a number of functions requires power even if there are no users to serve. But, if a cell is switched off, in the legal operator license there are still requirements on coverage, the coverage must be maintained at all times! The suspension of the cell may occur when the last user leaves the cell, all incoming handovers during this period of time will then be rejected. The cells that remain on, providing coverage, can wake up a suspended cell when traffic load increase. This can be done with a wake-up call to the sleeping cell.\n\nRACH optimisation aims to minimise the number of attempts on the RACH channel, causing interference. The UE can be polled by the eNB for RACH statistics after connection. The number of preambles sent until successful RACH completion, and the number of contention resolution failure are in the statistics. But PRACH configuration parameters can also be distributed amongst eNBs, like zero correlation configuration, root sequence, high speed flag and PRACH frequency offset.\n\nFeatures for automatic detection and removal of failures and automatic adjustment of parameters are mainly specified in Release 10.\n\nCoverage and Capacity Optimization enables automatic correction of capacity problems depending on slowly changing environment, like seasonal variations.\n\nMinimization of drive tests (MDT), is enabling normal UEs to provide the same type of information as those collected in drive test. A great advantage is that UEs can retrieve and report parameters from indoor environments.",

When concurrent location requests are supported, each entity needs to ensure it correlates each location/position response with the associated request and different concurrent location requests shall be treated separately without any dependency on one another by any entity.\nIf the entity, either itself or in association with another entity, cannot support concurrent location requests or it can only support up to a certain number of concurrent location requests, it can reject or defer a new concurrent request or cancel one or more existing requests. For Case B, it can also allow the new location request to proceed concurrently with and separately from the previous requests.\n\nLCS Client/AF priority and any other relevant priority information (e.g. UE subscription preferences) should be considered when rejecting or deferring a concurrent request or when cancelling one or more existing requests. In particular, location requests associated with emergency services or lawful interception clients should be given priority over other location requests.\n5.7.2\tCombining location requests by an H-GMLC or NEF\nAn H-GMLC or NEF may combine concurrent location requests (e.g. 5GC-MT LR, 5GC-MO LR, 5GC-NI LR) for the same target UE by executing only one request and using the ensuing location estimate result(s) to satisfy the other request(s). The conditions for this are as follows:\nAn H-GMLC may also combine concurrent location requests in the case of a bulk location request for a group of UEs as described in clause 6.8. In this case, location information for any UE in the group may be obtained from location information obtained from another concurrent location request for the same UE.\n\n5.7.3\tCombining location requests by a V-GMLC\nA V GMLC may combine concurrent 5GC-MT LR and 5GC-MO-LR related location requests for the same target UE provided it is clear and unambiguous for any 5GC-MT LR that will not be fully executed (e.g. from the contents of any location request received from the H GMLC) that no outstanding privacy related actions are required for the UE (e.g. no privacy notification and/or privacy verification interaction with the UE). QoS requirements must also be satisfied for the non-executed location requests.\n5.7.4\tCombining location requests by an AMF\nAn AMF may combine concurrent 5GC-MT LR, 5GC-MO LR and 5GC-NI LR location requests once any needed privacy related actions (e.g. UE notification and verification) have been performed for each 5GC-MT LR. (i.e. AMF may decide to not execute multiple positioning procedures for the concurrent location requests) QoS requirements must also be satisfied for the non-executed location requests.\n\n5.7.5\tCombining location requests by an LMF\nAn LMF may combine concurrent location requests for the same target UE provided QoS requirements can be satisfied for the non-executed location requests.\n5.7.6\tCombining location requests by a UE\nA UE may combine concurrent location requests provided QoS requirements can be satisfied and provided any positioning procedures with an LMF remain supported according to the positioning protocol.",

The MSC then sends an Abort signal to the VLR. Upon receipt of this message, the VLR shall follow one of two possible courses of action.\nThe two possible courses of action and the conditions determining which course shall be taken are as follows:\nSheet 1: the location area updating process will be activated by receiving an Update Location Area indication from the MSC. If there are parameter errors in the indication, the process is terminated with the appropriate error sent in the Update Location Area response to the MSC. Else, the behaviour will depend on the subscriber identity received, either an IMSI or a TMSI.\nThe Automatic Device Detection (ADD) function is an optional feature that allows the HLR to be updated with the current User Equipment (IMEISV) and thus enables the network to configure the subscriber's equipment based on a predefined profile. The mechanism for the IMEISV retrieval by device management system (either from HLR or VLR) is outside the scope of this specification. As an optimisation, the VLR may optionally store whether or not the HLR supports the ADD feature and use this information to decide whether or not to send an update to the HLR.\n\nThe Paging Area function is an optional feature that allows the HLR to be updated with the current Paging Area (PgA) (see subclause 2.6). If supported, whenever the paging area changes, the VLR shall send a MAP Update Location request with the Paging Area parameter set to the location areas belonging to the new paging area.  The Paging Area is then sent by the HLR (if available) to the VLR in the MAP Provide Roaming Number and may be used for paging optimisation after a MSC/VLR restart (see 3GPP TS 23.018 [5a]).\nSheet 1: The usage of a Hop Counter is an optional optimization.\nSheet 2: at the decision \"HLR updating required?\" the \"True\" branch shall be taken if and only if one or more of the following conditions is true:\nSheet 2: : The execution of the test \"HLR supports ADD?\" and the action \"set: skip subscriber data update\" is an optional optimisation and depends on the presence of the relevant indication from the HLR that ADD functionality is supported. If this optimisation is not supported on the VLR or no indication is received, both are bypassed in which case processing continues at connector 4.\n\nSheet 2: The execution of the test \"HLR supports PgA?\" and the action \"set: skip subscriber data update\" depends on the presence of the relevant indication from the HLR that PgA functionality is supported.\nSheet 2: The \"Subscriber data dormant\" flag is an optional parameter that shall at least be supported by VLR implementing the Mobile Terminating Roaming Retry feature (see 3GPP TS 23.018 [5a]). A VLR not supporting this flag shall behave as if the flag is set to false.\nSheet 2: A VLR supporting the Mobile Terminating Roaming Retry feature sets the \"Cancel Location received\" flag to false after authenticating the radio connection. This is used to determine whether to trigger MT roaming retry upon receipt of an incoming call, see subclause 7.3.2.1 of 3GPP TS 23.018 [5a].\nSheet 3: the procedure Obtain_IMSI_VLR is specified in 3GPP TS 23.018 [5a].\n\nThe type of Location Update is retrieved in 3GPP TS 23.078 procedure 'Set_Notification_Type' and is returned into the 'Notify' variable; this information is necessary for the CAMEL Mobility Management event notification procedure 3GPP TS 23.078 'Notify_gsmSCF'.",

Does it mean 'emergency' ? or 'electronic' ? or something else ?\n\nEven though I haven't seen any formal documents that explicitely defines the letter 'e' in eCall, I think it would not be wrong if you say the 'e' mean 'emergency', i.e, 'eCall' would mean 'emergency Call'. But this interpretation would confuse a lot of people. Then, how does eCall differ from what we normally call 'Emergency Call (like 911)' ?\n\nI will explain on the details of this difference later, but simply put, the biggest difference would be the usual 'Emergency call' is a kind of voice call between a human and Emergency Call Center (usually another person in Emergency Call Center)' but 'eCall' is a call between a machine (called IVS : In Vehicle System within an automobile) and Emergency Center;.\n\nFor the persons who likes formal definition, I would quote some descriptions from a couple of international standards as follows :\n\neCall is a manually or automatically initiated emergency call, (TS12 : teleServiceCode 12) from a vehicle, supplemented with a minimum set of emergency related data (MSD), as defined under the EU Commission's eSafety initiative\n\neCall provides reliable full-duplex data communications between IVS and PSAP in addition to emergency voice call (E112) via the cellular network, and can be initiated either automatically or manually. The eCall In-band Modem uses the same voice channel as used for the emergency voice call. eCall allows reliable transmission of MSD alternating with a speech conversation through the existing voice communication paths in cellular mobile phone systems. The expected benefit is that emergency services will be made aware of accidents much more rapidly, will get precise information on location, vehicle type etc. and therefore will be able to reach accident victims faster, with the potential to save many lives annually.\n\nBefore we talk of the technical details of eCall, let's take a 10000-feet overview (high level view) on how eCall go through. You may find a lot of illustrations, cartoons on eCall from internet and following is my own version of illustration. I put the number labels on each of the steps and I would put a short descriptions on what's happening at each step.\n\n(2) eCall is triggered. eCall can be triggered in many ways. It can be triggered automatically by Air Bag or internal sensors. Or a person (e.g, driver) in the car can push the emergency button in the car to trigger the eCall.\n\n(3) The eCall device installed in the car (called IVS : In-Vehicle System) go through Emergency Voice Call setup process to establish the voice call channel. Once the voice call channel is established, the IVS send eCall Data (MSD : Minimal Set of Data) to PSAP (Public Safety Answering Point)\n\n(4) Once the eCall Data(MSD) is received by PSAP, the information would show up automatically on the screen at PSAP center.\n\n(5) The personnel at PSAP center may try voice contact to the person in the car if possible. But there would be many cases where this is not possible when person in the car is injured badly.\n\nFor those who came from Cellular protocol and new to eCall, it would be a little confusing on figuring out the difference between eCall and another type of Emergency Call (like 911 in North America) which we are familiar with in daily life. For those people, I think it would be easier / clearer to explain the difference in terms of overall protocol sequence. Following is my understanding (the image formed in my brain when I first got trained about this).\n\nAs you see here in the following illustration, there is common portions and different portions between eCall and Emergency Call.\n\nNOTE : IVS stands for In-Vehicle System. It is the eCall / Cellular module that are installed within Car (within Telematics module in most case). In terms of testing, this is a DUT\n\neCall Higher Layer Application Protocol (HLAP) is very simple (at least comparting to Cellular Protocol). Actually there is only one critical data to be transferred. The critical data is called MSD(Minimal Set of Data). All the remaining part is just to get MSD delivered to PSAP (Emergency Call Center) with reliability.\n\nAs in Cellular Voice Call, in HLAP there are two different type of call mode depending on who (IVS or PSAP) initiates call. The eCall initiated by IVS is called 'PUSH mode' and this is similar concept as MO(Mobile Originating) call in cellular voice call.\n\nThe eCall initiated by PSAP is called 'PULL mode' and this is similar concept as MT(Mobile Terminating) call in cellular voice call.\n\nThe two illustrations in this section is based on ETSI 103.428 Figure 2. The ETSI diagram is a single diagram showing both PUSH and PULL mode in single sequence. It looked a little confusing to me, so I split the digram into two separate diagram as shown below.\n\nNOTE 1 : IVS stands for In-Vehicle System. It is the eCall / Cellular module that are installed within Car (within Telematics module in most case). In terms of testing, this is a DUT\n\nNOTE 2 : PSAP stands for Public Safety Answering Point. This is a kind of Emergency Call Center.\n\nPSAP PUSH Mode Call is like MO call in celluar terminology. This is the call initiated by IVS (the mobile unit installed inside the car). I think in most case of eCall, the eCall goes in PUSH mode as illustrated below.\n\nPSAP PUSH Mode Call is like MT call in celluar terminology. This is the call initiated by PSAP (the call center). If you compare this with PUSH mode sequence, you would notice that most of the part are same. The only difference is the SEND-MSD (START) signal before the Initiation signal. This is also very much like cellular protocol. If you compare the MO Call and MT Call sequence in cellular protocol, you would notice that most part of the two are almost same. The main difference is that in MT Call the cellular network send 'Paging' (a kind of trigger for UE to initiate the call).\n\nAnother sequence that illustrate the eCall process with a little low layer point of view (especially in terms of LL/HL ACK operation) is shown below. This applies to both PUSH and PULL model.\n\n< ETSI TR 126.969 - Figure 1: Timeline of eCall with IVS initiated signalling and HL-ACK in normal operation >\n\nThere are various timers in eCall protocol which should be met in order to guarantee the normal functionality of the eCall. Some of these timers are an important criterial of testing eCall functionality.\n\nAs mentioned above, the only one fundamental goal for eCall is to deliver MSD(Minimal Set of Data) with reliability. Then you may ask what kind of information is in the MSD. High level description of the imformation in MSD can be find from following description. As you see, the most important information in the MSD is the location data and vehicle information.\n\nThe eCall modem allows to transfer a data message from the IVS over the cellular network to the PSAP which is denoted as eCall MSD. The MSD can include, e.g. vehicle location information, time stamp, number of passengers, Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), and other relevant accident information\n\nThe Minimum Set of Data forming the data component of an eCall sent from a vehicle to a Public Safety Answering Point or other designated emergency call centre. The MSD has a maximum size of 140 bytes and includes, for example, vehicle identity, location information and time-stamp.\n\nBefore we think of this, let's think of why we need to care of this. We should care of this because eCall signaling message and data are delivered in the form of Voice call data of GSM or WCDMA cellular network.\n\nIn GSM / WCDMA, various different types of codecs are used. Basically the codec selection is a job for the specific Radio Access Network equipment(RAN Equipment) that is communicating with the eCall device. The RAN Equipment (Network) would select the codec that would give the best performance in a specific situation. 'Performance' mean 'How fast the eCall data can be delivered' and 'How reliably it can be delivered under a specific channel condition'. It would be too much (or too boring) to present the full details on these performance here. If you are really interested in the details, refer to ETSI TR 126.969 and it would give you a lot of test data for various different Codecs.\n\nIn theory, you can use a live network and PSAP Simulator to test your eCall Device (IVS). But theory is just a theory. You would come across a lot of issues to overcome if you go for this option even though I cannot say it is impossible.\n\nAnother way of testing the eCall device is to construct test setup as described in ETSI 103.428 section 6 Test Configurations. In this document, it is described to use a private cellular network for various Interoperability and Conformance Testing.\n\nThe most practical solution (Test setup) that will be used in the industry would be to use Cellular Network Simulator and PSAP simulator as illustrated below.\n\nAssuming that you have a test setup and you need to determine what to test. As in most of other wireless and cellular device device, you may think of general test that tend to happen during the development or system integration stage. We often call these test in various different name such as function test, integration test or smoke test etc. Usually test specification / procedure tend not to be clearly defined or the procedure changes often depending on situations. Also those test procedure / test item may vary depending on manufacturer. Therefore, it would not be easy to clearly define on what to test for this stage. However, if you just take a close look at the overall eCall protocol, you would easily guess high level test items even without looking into any specification. My personal version of the guess work about the first level test are shown below. You may come up with different idea, but I don't think there would be any big difference between your idea and my idea.\n\nOnce you complete the general function test during development and system integration level and have a stable device, you would forward the device to conformance test. Once you are at the stage of conformance test, you don't have to worry about what to test because a lot of other people (standard body) put a lot of effort and energy and came out with well defined document. In 3GPP/ETSI, those test procedures are defined in ETSI TS 103.428.\n\nAfter completing the conformance, if you are trying to sell the device (acutually Automakers trying to sell cars) in a specific region (e.g, Europe, Asia, America etc), you may need to go through a specific set of test cases specified by the regulatory body in that specific region.\n\nFollowings are the examples of how eCall is being testing during the development or for conformance test before commercialization.\n\nFollowings are the list of the specifications for eCall. I think the most fundamental specifications are CEN documents. But it is not free to get those spec. Recently 3GPP / ETSI has released various specifications. I think most part of the 3GPP specification are based on CEN specification.\n\n: Describes mostly on physical/transport layer design and process of transmitter and reciever.\n\n: This documents describes on API and parameter descriptions of eCall modem protocol stack. It describes on overall software architecture and API prototype but not show the function body. Unless you are developing the protocol stack, you would not need to read this spec.\n\n: This documents describes general logics on eCall Test, but it does not specifies any specific test cases or details of protocol sequence. If you are interested in physical / transport layer level testing, this document would help you to catch the overall test concept.\n\n: If you are interested in high level protocol and function test, this document would help a lot. It shows overall protocol sequence of eCall and decfines specific test sequences. Most of the test in this document (as of V1.1.1 (2016-06)) are based on CEN EN 16062:2015\n\nRoad transport and traffic telematics eSafety eCall minimum set of data - Draft EN 081018\n\nIntelligent transport systems eSafety - Pan European eCall - Operating requirements",

    "context": "https://www.sharetechnote.com/html/WLAN_802_11ac.html\n\nWiFi: 802.11ac\n\nFollowing is the list of the main characteristics of 802.11ac. Most of these main characteristics would lead to some addition / modification of PLDC and MAC frame structure. These detailed changes will be summarized in each corresponding sections. If you are not familiar with WLAN frame structure and basic operations I would recommend you to go through WLAN Frame structure and WLAN protocol page first.\n\nAs in almost every evolution of every communication technology (except IoT), the major motivation of 802.11ac is to achieve much higher throughput than the previous highest throughput technology (802.11n in this case). I am pretty sure that you will see another technology targeted for even higher throughput than 802.11ac (We are already hearing of 802.11ad).\n\nThen what is the technical strategy to achieve this high throughput ? Overall strategy is also same as other technology (If you have seen the evolution process of celluar technology (e.g, WCDMA -> HSPA -> DC HSPA or LTE -> LTE MIMO -> Carrier Aggregation etc), you will easily understand the strategy. Some of the technologies for this evolution can be listed as follows\n\nWith the list in mind, if you try to correlate each of these technologies to each items of specification of 802.11ac, it will be much easier to get the big picture or motivation of those specification.\n\nJust to give you more practical insight on this motivation, I would compare 802.11n (the most advanced technology before 802.11ac) and 802.11ac with the respect t the features/technologies listed above. (NOTE : I got most of these information from Ref [13]. I would recommend you to read through this document at least once if you have time)\n\nNo new technology can be invented overnight. We all understand this. However, we don't want to wait forever until everything is ready all at once. A common practice in this case is to split those requirement/wishlist into multiple chunks and attack them chunk by chunk. In some technology, they call these chunk as 'Stage' (like Stage 1, Stage 2 etc) and in some technology they call them as 'Phase' (e.g, Phase 1, Phase 2 etc). In 802.11ac, they call them as Wave (e.g, Wave 1, Wave 2 etc). 802.11ac has been evolved as two Waves (at least as of now, Aug 2016) as listed below.\n\nIf you have a 802.11ac WLAN Card (device), the first thing you have to do is to figure out the Access Point (AP) around the device support 802.11ac. (Actually you don't need to figure out this, your WLAN device will figure out :).\n\nThen how your WLAN device will figure out whether the AP support 802.11ac or not ? It is by decoding the special information signal from the AP called Beacon. If your AP support 802.11ac, it will broadcast Beancon signal containing following information.\n\nFollowing Beacon Signal is the one from a WLAN Test equipment, Anritsu MT8862. Anritsu kindly provided me a full sample log starting from Beacon through user data and it will be a great resource for my study. I will sharing more as I learn more from the log. You can see the test setup on how this log is captured.\n\nIt may look simple two lines of information, but it will contain a lot of details of the 802.11ac capability that the AP supports. Following is the full decoded information.\n\n.... .... .... .... .... .... .... ..10 = Maximum MPDU Length: 11 454 (0x00000002)\n\n.... .... .... .... .... .... .... 00.. = Supported Channel Width Set: Neither 160MHz\n\n.... .... .... .... .... .... .0.. .... = Short GI for 160MHz and 80+80MHz: Not supported\n\n.... .... .... .... 000. .... .... .... = Compressed Steering Number of Beamformer Antennas\n\n.... .... .... .000 .... .... .... .... = Number of Sounding Dimensions: 1 (0x00000000)\n\n.... .... .0.. .... .... .... .... .... = +HTC-VHT Capable (VHT variant HT Control field):\n\n.... ..11 1... .... .... .... .... .... = Max A-MPDU Length: 1 048 575 (0x00000007)\n\n.... 00.. .... .... .... .... .... .... = VHT Link Adaptation: No Feedback (0x00000000)\n\n...0 .... .... .... .... .... .... .... = Rx Antenna Pattern Consistency: Not supported\n\n..0. .... .... .... .... .... .... .... = Tx Antenna Pattern Consistency: Not supported\n\n...0 0000 0000 0000 = Rx Highest Long GI Data Rate (in Mb/s, 0 = subfield not in use):\n\n...0 0000 0000 0000 = Tx Highest Long GI Data Rate (in Mb/s, 0 = subfield not in use):\n\nCommunication is the exchange of information between two or more parties. The previous section showed how the device can figure out the 802.11ac capability of AP. Then you would ask how the AP can figure out 802.11ac capability of the device. The AP can figure out the device capability from [Probe Request] message from the device as shown below.\n\n.... .... .... .... .... .... .... ..0. = Receive Staggered Sounding: Not supported\n\n.... .... .... .... .00. .... .... .... = Receiver can return explicit uncompressed\n\n...0 0... .... .... .... .... .... .... = Maximum number of space time streams for\n\n.... .... .... .... .... .... .... ..10 = Maximum MPDU Length: 11 454 (0x00000002)\n\n.... .... .... .... 010. .... .... .... = Compressed Steering Number of Beamformer\n\n.... .... .0.. .... .... .... .... .... = +HTC-VHT Capable (VHT variant HT Control\n\n.... ..11 1... .... .... .... .... .... = Max A-MPDU Length:1 048 575 (0x00000007)\n\n...1 .... .... .... .... .... .... .... = Rx Antenna Pattern Consistency:Supported\n\n..1. .... .... .... .... .... .... .... = Tx Antenna Pattern Consistency:Supported\n\nOne of the most important keywords in 802.11ac would VHT. VHT stands for Very High Throughput. You would not need any additional explanation on what this means. The meaning is obvious and self-explanatory.\n\nThe question is how to achieve VHT and what kind of new frames and protocols are introduced to implement this.\n\nIn wireshark log, you may see this framing information from Radiotap Header as shown below.\n\n802.11ac support various types of bandwidth combination like 20 Mhz, 80 Mhz, 160 Mhz. Then the question would 'how do they allocate the bandwidth ?'. Statically or Dynamically ?\n\nStatic allocation means that Transmitter (Initiator) and Reciever(Responder) negotiate and determines the bandwidth during early stage of connection setup and keep it same until the end of communication (a session).\n\nDynamic allocation means that Transmitter and Reciever SOMEHOW negotiate/determine the bandwidth in very short interval even during a single session.\n\n802.11ac picked up the dynamic allocation approach. It allows the change of the bandwidth at every transmission.\n\nThen the question is 'HOW ?'. What kind of negotiation they use to determine/agree upon the bandwidth between Transmitter and Reciever ?\n\nBasic Idea is simple. As you see in Data Transmission in Detail section, basic channel acquisition process for all 802.11 is based on RTS/CTS mechanism. 802.11ac use the same mechanism to determine the avaiable bandwidth dynamically. The idea is to split the whole possible 802.11ac band into multiple blocks of basic segments (e.g, 20 Mhz, 40 Mhz, 80 Mhz etc) and perform the multiple RTS/CTS simulateneously across the multiple frequency block. (It is very similary for Carrier Aggregation in LTE). First, the initiator sends multiple RTS accross the multiple frequency block and wait for CTS. If the initiator recieves CTS accross the all the blocks, it can use all the frequency blocks (very wide aggregated bandwidth). If the initiator recieves only a few CTS for the all transmitted RTS, it uses the smaller bandwidth for which CTS is recieved. (Refer to Ref [9] for the details).\n\nLet me give you a couple of examples with illustration on how Dynamic Bandwidth goes. Here goes only two cases but there can be much more variations on this.\n\nThis is the case where there is no interference between Node A(initiator) and Node B(recipient) and the full bandwith is avaiable for both nodes. Of course, these nodes does not know anything about the bandwidth availability before it completes step 3. Step 0 : Right before Step 1, it is assumed that Node A split the whole 80 Mhz section into 4 contiguous 20 Mhz block and performed carrier sensing for each of these 20 Mhz block. And it is assumed that all of these 20 Mhz block turned out to be available. Step 1 : Node A wait for a certain time period called DIFS(DCF Inter Frame Space), assuming that the scheduling is done in DCF. Step 2 : Node A transmit RTS for each of 20 Mhz block to Node B using 802.11a frame and it is assumed that all of these RTS reached Node B successfully. Step 3 : (Assuming that Node B detected RTS for all of 20 Mhz blocks) Node B transmit CTS using 802.11a frame for every 20 Mhz subblocks. Step 4 : (Assuming that Node A detected CTS for all of 20 Mhz blocks) Node A assumes that all 80Mhz BW is clear/no-interference and transmit the data in 802.11ac mode utilizing the full 80 Mhz. Step 5 : (Assuming that Node B received and decoded the whole data) Node B sends Ack for every 20 Mhz blocks (40 Mhz in total).\n\nThis is the case where there is some interference in some spectrum blocks within the 80 Mhz block on Node B(recipient). Of course, these nodes does not know anything about the bandwidth availability before it completes step 3. Step 0 : Right before Step 1, it is assumed that Node A split the whole 80 Mhz section into 4 contiguous 20 Mhz block and performed carrier sensing for each of these 20 Mhz block. And it is assumed that all of these 20 Mhz block turned out to be available. Step 1 : Node A wait for a certain time period called DIFS(DCF Inter Frame Space), assuming that the scheduling is done in DCF. Step 2 : Node A transmit RTS for each of 20 Mhz block to Node B using 802.11a frame. Step 3 : (In various reason, e.g, Node B failed to receive RTS due to interference or Medium is busy based on carrier sensing ) Node B transmit CTS using 802.11a frame for only two consecutive 20 Mhz blocks. Step 4 : (Assuming that Node A detected CTS for the two 20 Mhz blocks) Node A assumes that only 40Mhz BW is clear/no-interference and transmit the data in 802.11ac mode utilizing the 40 Mhz.

Most of New Frametype is for impelementing Channel Measurement and Report to perform MU-MIMO Beamforming.\n\nThis frame is used for BeamFormer (AP) to initiate Channel Measurement Process. (Refer to 802.11ac 8.3.1.20 VHT NDP Announcement frame format for the details)\n\nIt indicates the number of columns, Nc, in the Compressed Beamforming Feedback Matrix\n\nThis frame is used for BeamFormee (user) to report channel measurement result (Refer to 802.11ac 8.5.23.2 VHT Compressed Beamforming frame format for the details)\n\nTo perform proper beamforming for specific devices, it is crucial to figure out accurate channel condition between BeamFormer and BeanFormee. To figure out the channel condition, BeamFormer and BeamFormee performs a specific sequence of calibration process and this process is called Channel Measurement or Sounding process. It goes as follows.\n\nRefer to 802.11ac 9.31.5.2 Rules for VHT sounding protocol sequences, Figure 9-41a and Figure 9-41a for the details.\n\nNOTE : The fundamental purpose of this complicated process is to figure out the charateristics (nature) of radio channel between the Access Point and Devices. This is also called 'Channel Sounding'. During this process, no user data is conveyed. It means this process can be a kind of overhead (throughput degradation factor). If AP can best optimize the communication by extracting the most suitable BeamForming parameters from this process, this process can give a overall throughput gain. However, if AP failed to get the best BeamForming parameters from this process, this would just create unncessary overhead.\n\nMU-MIMO stands for Multi User MIMO and this is adopted only in 802.11ac (not in 802.11n and lower). When we say MIMO(Multi Input Multi Output), it normally mean SU-MIMO(Single User MIMO), which is a MIMO targeted to only one device(user). On the contrary, MU-MIMO is the MIMO targeted to multiple user simulateneously. It mean that in MU-MIMO the transmitter (Access Point) can transmite the multiple stream of data targeted to multiple user.\n\nIt sounds fancy, right ? However, the implementation of this technology would not be as easy as it sound and real performance would not be as good as expected. Probably it would need to go through a long way of evolution. Let's think of some of the challenges and possible issues related to MU-MIMO\n\nPutting aside the practical feasibility of this MU-MIMO, the specification is done. In most case of technology (even though it is not all the case), once the specification is issued the technology continues to evolve and get better and better.\n\n802.11ac MU-MIMO Beamforming is expressed in a mathematical expression as follows (this is based on 802.11ac 22.3.11 SU-MIMO and DL-MU-MIMO Beamforming)\n\nWhenever a new version of any technology comes out, one of the most concerning thing is compatibility. Can this new stuff work with all of those old stuffs out there already ? You would have the same questions about 802.11ac. Is 802.11ac compatitle with the existing (previous) techology (e.g, 802.11a and 802.11n) ? The answer is Yes. 802.11ac is designed from beginning to be compatible with 802.11a / n both for Access point and devices.\n\n[12] How to validate the WI-FI Information within Wireshark Part I: Determining the WLAN capabilities",

In terms of MAC layer, you may say ZigBee complies to 802.15.4 and in terms of PHY layer, you can say ZigBee implements a sub set of 802.15.4 PHY specification. In a very detailed implementation, there is some possibility that ZigBee PHY layer has a little bit of variations from 802.15.4 PHY specification since ZigBee has been in the market for pretty long time and it was commercialized even before every details of 802.15.4 PHY has clearly been defined. In addition, ZigBee has been driven by its own alliance group (ZigBee Alliance) as you might have seen how Bluetooth has been evolved/promoted by Bluetooth Alliance (or Bluetooth Special Interest Group). If you are seriously interested in the technical details of ZigBee, you would need to cover both IEEE 802.15.4 and various documents published by ZigBee Alliance.\n\nFollowing is overall sturcture of ZigBee in comparison with 6LoWPAN.

Operators have met this challenge by increasing capacity with new radio spectrum, adding multi-antenna techniques and implementing more efficient modulation and coding schemes.\n\nHowever, these measures alone are insufficient in the most crowded environments and at cell edges where performance can significantly degrade. Operators are also adding small cells and tightly-integrating these with their macro networks to spread traffic loads, widely maintain performance and service quality while reusing spectrum most efficiently.\n\nOne way to expand an existing macro-network, while maintaining it as a homogeneous network, is to \"densify\" it by adding more sectors per eNB or deploying more macro-eNBs. However, reducing the site-to-site distance in the macro-network can only be pursued to a certain extent because finding new macro-sites becomes increasingly difficult and can be expensive, especially in city centres. An alternative is to introduce small cells through the addition of low-power base stations (eNBs, HeNBs or Relay Nodes (RNs)) or Remote Radio Heads (RRH) to existing macro-eNBs. Site acquisition is easier and cheaper with this equipment which is also correspondingly smaller.\n\nSmall cells are primarily added to increase capacity in hot spots with high user demand and to fill in areas not covered by the macro network - both outdoors and indoors. They also improve network performance and service quality by offloading from the large macro-cells. The result is a heterogeneous network with large macro-cells in combination with small cells providing increased bitrates per unit area. See Figure 1.\n\nHeterogeneous network planning was already used in GSM. The large and small cells in GSM are separated through the use of different frequencies. This solution is still possible in LTE. However, LTE networks mainly use a frequency reuse of one to maximize utilization of the licensed bandwidth.\n\nIn heterogeneous networks the cells of different sizes are referred to as macro-, micro-, pico- and femto-cells; listed in order of decreasing base station power. The actual cell size depends not only on the eNB power but also on antenna position, as well as the location environment; e.g. rural or city, indoor or outdoor . The HeNB (Home eNB) was introduced in LTE Release 9 (R9). It is a low power eNB which is mainly used to provide indoor coverage, femto-cells, for Closed Subscriber Groups (CSG), for example, in office premises. See Figure 2.\n\nSpecific to HeNBs, is that they are privately owned and deployed without coordination with the macro-network. If the frequency used in the femto-cell is the same as the frequency used in the macro-cells, and the femto-cell is only used for CSG, then there is a risk of interference between the femto-cell and the surrounding network.\n\nThe Relay Node (RN) is another type of low-power base station added to the LTE R10 specifications. The RN is connected to a Donor eNB (DeNB) via the Un radio interface, which is based on the LTE Uu interface. See Figure 2. When the frequencies used on Uu and Un for the RN are the same, there is a risk of self interference in the RN. From the UE perspective the RN will act as an eNB, and from the DeNB's view the RN will be seen as a UE. As also mentioned, RRHs connected to an eNB via fibre can be used to provide small cell coverage.\n\nIntroducing a mix of cell sizes and generating a heterogeneous network adds to the complexity of network planning. In a network with a frequency reuse of one, the UE normally camps on the cell with the strongest received DL signal (SSDL), hence the border between two cells is located at the point where SSDL is the same in both cells. In homogeneous networks, this also typically coincides with the point of equal path loss for the UL (PLUL) in both cells. In a heterogeneous network, with high-power nodes in the large cells and low-power nodes in the small cells, the point of equal SSDL will not necessarily be the same as that of equal PLUL. See Figure 3.\n\nA major issue in heterogeneous network planning is to ensure that the small cells actually serve enough users. One way to do that is to increase the area served by the small cell, which can be done through the use of a positive cell selection offset to the SSDL of the small cell. This is called Cell Range Extension (CRE). See Figure 4.\n\nA negative effect of this is the increased interference on the DL experienced by the UE located in the CRE region and served by the base station in the small cell. This may impact the reception of the DL control channels in particular.\n\nA number of features added to the 3GPP LTE specification can be used to mitigate the above-mentioned interference problem in heterogeneous networks with small cells:\n\nICIC was introduced in R8. The eNBs can communicate using ICIC via the X2 interface to mitigate inter-cell interference for UEs at the cell edge. The X2AP message used for this is called \"Load Information\". See Figure 5. Through the \"Load Information\" message an eNB can inform neighbouring eNBs about: UL interference level per Physical Resource Block (PRB); UL PRBs that are allocated to cell edge UEs, and hence are sensitive to UL interference; and if DL Tx power is higher or lower than a set threshold value. The eNBs receiving these messages can use the received information to optimize scheduling for UEs at cell edges.\n\nICIC has evolved to better support heterogeneous network deployments -- especially interference control for DL control channels. Enhanced ICIC (eICIC) was introduced in LTE R10. The major change is the addition of time domain ICIC, realized through use of Almost Blank Subframes (ABS). ABS includes only control channels and cell-specific reference signals, no user data, and is transmitted with reduced power. When eICIC is used, the macro-eNB will transmit ABS according to a semi-static pattern. During these subframes, UEs at the edge, typically in the CRE region of small cells, can receive DL information, both control and user data. The macro-eNB will inform the eNB in the small cell about the ABS pattern. See Figure 6.\n\nICIC is evolved in LTE R11 to further enhanced ICIC (feICIC). The focus here is interference handling by the UE through inter-cell interference cancellation for control signals, enabling even further cell range extension.\n\neICIC and feICIC are especially important when Carrier Aggregation (CA) is not used.\n\nCarrier Aggregation (CA) is introduced in R10, with backward compatibility to R8, to increase the total bandwidth available to UEs and hence their maximum bitrates. When CA is used a number of R8 carriers, referred to as Component Carriers (CC), are aggregated and any CA-capable UE can be allocated resources on all CCs, while R8/R9 UEs can only be allocated resources on one CC. Cross-carrier scheduling is an important feature in heterogeneous networks. Using cross-carrier scheduling it is possible to map the Physical DL control channels (PDCCH) on different CCs in the large and small cells. See Figure 7. The PDCCH, carrying DL Control Information (DCI) with scheduling information, must be received by the UEs at the cell edge; PDCCH may be transmitted with higher power than the traffic channels. Hence, using different carriers for the PDCCH in the large and small cells reduces the risk of PDCCH interference.\n\nFrom LTE R11 onwards it is possible to handle CA with CCs requiring different timing advance (TA); for example, combining CCs from eNBs with CCs from RRHs. See Figure 8.\n\nOne way to ensure that a UE is using both the best DL and the best UL carrier in a heterogeneous network is to use CoMP, introduced in LTE R11. With CoMP a number of transmission/reception points (i.e. eNBs, RNs or RRHs) can be coordinated to provide service to a UE - for example, data can be transmitted at the same time in the same PRBs from more than one transmission point to one UE, or data can be received from one transmission point in one subframe and from another transmission point in the next subframe. CoMP can be used both in DL and UL. When CoMP is used in a heterogeneous network a number of macro-cells and small cells can be involved in data transmission to and from one UE. Especially useful in heterogeneous networks is the possibility for a UE in the cell range extension region to utilize the best UL in the small cell and the best DL in the macro-cell. See Figure 9. This, however, requires that the macro-eNB and the base station in the small cell are synchronized, and most likely it will require a combination of macro-eNB with RRHs in the small cell.\n\nFurther enhancements regarding heterogeneous network and small cells are coming in future 3GPP Releases. At the time of writing, Release 12 is still in the process of being formulated with some features in the study phase and others, such as work on interference management for neighbour TDD cells, dual connectivity between the macro cell and small cells, mobility planning within hyper-dense environments and advances in carrier aggregation combinations already in the normative phase (specifications).\n\nFuture updates to this paper will include what has been achieved with the completion of Release 12 during the second half of 2014.\n\n\"...Coordinating the low-power layer of small cells with the macro network improves performance across the entire network while also further boosting efficiencies in spectrum use and power consumption, automating network configuration and optimization. The upcoming 3GPP Release 12 (due to be frozen September 2014) standardises various capabilities in these developments including dual connectivity, small cell on/off and 256 QAM...\" ...Read the full article",

This service component controls the transfer of the trace records from the NEFs to the OSF. The conceptual model is illustrated in figure 5, which employs both the event report function (CCITT X.734 [14]) and the log control function (CCITT X.735 [15]).\n\nThe trace control function collects traceable events within the NEF and formats them into trace records. These trace records may be stored locally within the NEF filestore or transferred to the OSF in the form of event reports. This is controlled by means of the \"priority\" indicator, which is a part of the trace type. If the \"priority\" indicator is not set then the trace records shall stored within the local filestore and subsequently transferred to the OSF in bulk via FTAM.\n\nIf a trace is activated with the \"priority\" indicator set then the trace records shall be sent to the OSF either direct by the trace control function or through Event Forwarding Discriminators (EFDs).\n\nIf EFDs are used then all trace records are offered to the EFDs. The EFDs determine which of the records are to be transmitted to the OSF in the form of event reports and the Operation System Id field in the header is ignored. The EDFs have complex filter constructs, which allow the operator to define the criteria for destinations and filters.\n\nIf EFDs are not used then all priority records are forwarded to the OSF whose address is given in the Operation System Id field. The NEF is required to supply additional information to provide the OS management application entity title.\n\nFinally, the trace records may also be stored in the form of log entries within the log of the NEF. It is up to the operator to decide if the log function is needed in parallel with the event reporting and file store. Once stored, the log records may be individually accessed by the OSF via the appropriate object management functions. Care should be taken of filter criteria for log records to avoid unnecessary overheads.\n\nThis service component contains the following groups of TMN management functions:\n\n9.2\tTransfer of Records\n\n9.2.1\tBulk record transfer\n\nThis group of TMN functions is concerned with the bulk transfer of trace records from the NEF record filestore to the OSF.\n\nThe trace records shall be transferred from the NEF to the OSF by the use of FTAM services. For further details of the use of FTAM see GSM 12.01 [8].\n\nIn addition to the simple file transfer services provided by FTAM, peertopeer application process communication may also be supported. The use of CMIS services for the uploading of files from the NEF to the OSF is specified in the GSM 12.00 [7].\n\nWhen the procedure defined in GSM 12.00 [7] and GSM 12.01 [8] are used to transfer the trace records, the file type shall be traceRecords and the format of the file is given by the type TraceFileFormat.\n\n9.2.2\tLog control\n\nThis function permits the trace record to be stored and retrieved from logs within the NEF. The logging of these records is performed in accordance with the log control function specified in CCITT X.735 [15] and no additional management functions are required.\n\n9.2.3\tLog access\n\nThis TMN function controls the access to the log described above.

The event forwarding discriminator construct is extremely flexible permitting the combination of a number of fields and logical operations with a wide variety of scheduling options. The EFD also controls the destinations to which the event reports are sent. Several such filters may be defined and scheduled for operation at different times and for different time periods.\n\nThe following system management functions are required:\n\n9.2.4.2\tDirect Transfer by Trace Control Function\n\nThis function permits the NEF to transmit trace records direct to the OSF. In general the trace record shall be sent on completion of the call or the traceable event. This function is controlled by means of the \"priority\" indicator, which is contained in the trace type. If the priority indicator is not set, then the trace records shall be stored on file within the NE filestore. These records may be subsequently collected via bulk record transfer as described in subclause 9.2.1. If the trace type specified on activation includes the \"priority\" indicator then all of the records shall be sent via trace reports to the OSF specified by the operation system id.\n\nThe following system management functions are required:",

As in the macrocell case, N = 6 paths are modeled. We list the entire procedure but only describe the details of the steps that differ from the corresponding step of the macrocell procedure.\n\nStep 1: Choose the urban microcell environment.\n\nStep 2: Determine various distance and orientation parameters.\n\nStep 3: Determine the bulk path loss and log normal shadow fading parameters.\n\nStep 4: Determine the random delays for each of the N multipath components. For the microcell environment, N = 6. The delays n = 1, … , N are i.i.d. random variables drawn from a uniform distribution from 0 to 1.2 s.\n\nStep 5:  The minimum of these delays is subtracted from all so that the first delay is zero. The delays are quantized in time to the nearest 1/16th chip interval as described in Clause 5.3.1.

The PDP consists of N=6 distinct paths that are uniformly distributed between 0 and 1.2s. The powers for each path are exponentially decaying in time with the addition of a lognormal randomness, which is independent of the path delay:\n\nStep 7: Determine  AoDs for each of the N multipath components.

Sub-paths are randomly paired for each path, and the sub-path phases defined at the BS and MS are maintained.\n\nStep 13: Determine the antenna gains of the BS and MS sub-paths as a function of their respective sub-path AoDs and AoAs.\n\nStep 14: Apply the path loss based on the BS to MS distance and the log normal shadow fading determined in Step 3 as bulk parameters to each of the sub-path powers of the channel model.\n\nThe values in Table 5.2 are selected to produce a biased standard deviation equal to 2, 5, and 35 degrees, which is equivalent to the per-path power weighted azimuth spread for equal power sub-paths.",

However, he warned that if e-Meetings need to carry on beyond June, the delay could be greater than the six months currently being projected by the RAN leadership.\n\nLionel Morand, the TSG CT Chair presented his report (SP-200858), which echoed the need for a firm decision on the new schedule in December. He commented \"The decision we take - on the delay to the Release 17 Stage 2 (normative) freeze date should be considered as firm and definitive. A moving target would make it very difficult to correctly plan for the Stage 3 (protocols) work.\"\n\nGeorg Mayer noted that the groups are well aligned on the meeting schedules and now officials and delegates will continue the discussion about how long the delay must be. He advised that for the immediate Stage 2 work; more time was granted already. For the release as a whole, he said: \"We want to give a clear statement in December on how long the Release 17 work will take. This situation is not ideal, but these are not ideal times.\"\n\nMore about the 3GPP Release-17 timeline is online here: https://www.3gpp.org/release-17",

Tech.: Fading\n\nIntuitive understanding of Fading would be simple, but the detailed description is pretty difficult and would be even more difficult to understand the details without going through the complicated mathematical process. This page would start with Intuitive description and try to keep adding the details one by one. It will take long time to complete the pages and will split this into multiple pages if it goes too long.\n\nIn most of the wireless communication environement, a signal out of a transmitter radiate into wide direction and these radiated signal takes different path and arriving at the reciever at different timing and with different signal strength(amplitude). As a result, the signal coming into the reciever is the composite of all the components. As you may learned in high school physics, when thetwo\ncopies of the signal get combined the resulting signal can be an augmented signal or attenuated signal depending on whether the two signal constructively combined or destructively combined.\n\nThen what determines whether the signals constructively combine or destructively combine ? The answer also come from high school physics. The phase of the two signal determines whether the signal constructively combine or destructively combine.\n\nIn wireless communication environment, many copies of the signals get combined at the reciever side and some of them constructively combines and some of them destructively combines. So final result of combination of all the incoming signals become very complicated and the combined signal becomes drastically different from the original signal tranmitted from the source. In most case, the quality\nof the combined signal at the reciever gets poorer (deteriorated) than the original signal. This kind of process of signal deterioration by the multiple propogation path of a signal is called 'Fading'. When we say \"Fading\", it usually implies \"Signal quality gets bad\".\n\nFor more intuitive unerstanding of the fading, I will show you a couple of different aspect of fading you can mesure using various equipments.\n\nFirst, let's compare a faded signal and non-faded signal using a spectrum analyzer. You would get the two results as follows and you will see the highly fluctuating amplitude across the channel bandwidth. (Note : These two capture are not the one from the same signal, so comparing the absolute value of the amplitude does not make any sense. Just take the image of overall amplitude profile).\n\nNow let's look at how the fading influence the signal quality decoded by the reciever. Look at the following samples of constellation for faded and non-faded signal.\n\nNow let's get into even further and I think this is the thing that you would be most interested in. How this fading would influence the final performance. Following graph shows the data rate at PHY layer and PDCP layer. The plot showing at the top (labeled as 'PHY Transmission Rate') is the amount of data being transmitted per second by PHY layer of the transmitter. The plot in the middle\n(labeled as 'PHY throughput with HARQ ACK' is the amount of data getting ACKED per second from the reiever PHY layer. You see there is pretty much gap between the two plots. It means that a considerable portions of the data were failed to get properly decoded by the reciever and the reciever sent NACK for the data. Normally in this case, the transmitter PHY layer retransmits the previous data rather than moving into the next step of the transmission.\n\nThe plot at the bottom (labelled as 'PDCP Transmission Rate') is the amount of data being sent to the lower layer from the transmitter's PDCP layer. You will see another gap here. It is not easy to explain exactly what is causing this gap. In this case, some portions of the gap would come from the overhead of higher layer data structure but majority of the gap would be because PDCP cannot\npush the data down to the lower layer since PHY layer is too busy with retransmitting the previous data rather than transmitting the new data coming from the higher layer.\n\nThere are many factors generating Fading effect. Followings are the list of components (factors) of fading we can think of.\n\nTo study on fading requires the detailed understanding of each of these components. If I express some major components in visual form, it can be presented as follows. Just from the high level view, you should see some typtical pattern from this representation. First notice that the horizontal axis represents 'Distance in Linear Scale'. You may have seen a lot of different plots in various\ntextbook and get confused by those. One of the first step to remove those confusion would be clearly understanding the meaning of axis of the graph. Even for the same things, you would see different shape of plots if you define the meaning of the axis differently. One of the factors from various text confusing you the most is the scale of each axis. For example, in case of path loss graph in some textbook where they represent the axis in log scale you would see a straight line, but in this page you\nare seeing a kind of negative exponential graph since the axis is represented in linear scale.\n\nPath loss is just gradually decreases but not much of fluctuation. In the second plot, you see some fluctuation of the signal strength but the fluctuation frequency over the distance is not that high. In the third plot, you see fluctuations of signal strength and the fluctuation frequency is also pretty high.\n\nWhen you observe a real received signal, you wouldn't see these factors in separate form as in the graph on the left side. What you see at the real reciever is the result of summation of all the factors and it is like the graph on the right side.\n\nProbably the words you might have heard the most frequently when you talking about fading would be 'Fast Fading', 'Slow Fading'. Intuitively it sounds simple. But not easy to find clear/technical defintion for these. How fast it should be to be Fast Fading ? How slow it should be to be Slow Fading ?\n\nI found a very good definition and technical explanation from the reference [2]. It states as follows:\n\nFast Fading is used to describe channels in which Channel Coherence Time < Tansmission Symbol Time. Fast Fading describes a condition where the time duration in which the channel behaves in a correlated mannel is short compared to the time duration of a symbol. Therefore, it can be expected that the fading characteristic of the channel will change several times while a symbol is propagating, leading to distortion of the baseband pulse shape. Analogous to the distortion described as ISI, the distortion take place because the recieved signal's components are not all highly correlated throughout time. Hence, fast fading can cause the baseband pulse to be distorted, resulting in a loss of SNR that often yields an irreducible error rate. Such distorted pulses cause synchronization problems (failure of phase-locked-loop recievers), in addition to difficulties in adequately defining a matched filter.\n\nSlow Fading is used to describe channels in which Channel Coherence Time > Tansmission Symbol Time. Here, the time duration that the channel behaves in a correlated manner is long compared to the time duration of a transmission symbol. Thus, one can expect the channel state to virtually remain unchanged during the time in which a symbol is transmitted. The propaging symbols will likely not suffer from the pulse distortion. The primary degradation in a slow-fading channel, as with flat fading, is loss in SNR.\n\nPath Loss and Shadowing may not be considered to be a part of Fading in narrow sense, but it can be considered as a factor causing the fading in wider sense. Understanding or Modeling the path loss is not that difficult. You may see a mathematical model which you were faimilar with in your high school math. The famous format of anti-proportional to 'something squared'.\n\nModling for Path Loss is done with the respect to the distance between a transmitter and receiver. The key question is ..\n\nTest A) When a transmitter antenna is transmitting a certain (fixed) amount of energy and you put a measurement antenna which is a certain distance (let's call this distance as 'd') and measure the received(measured) energy. Once you get the value at a certain 'd', write down the value. And then move the reciever antenna a little bit further and do the same measurement and write down\nthe value. Repeat this process as you move 'd' further and further and collect all the measured value and plot it on the graph with horizontal axis = d and vertical axis = measured energy level (power). How would the plot look like ? Can you come up with an equation to represent the graph ?\n\nTest B) Now let's try a little bit different type of measurement. This time, draw a circle with radius d with the transmitter antenna at the center. and then put several antenna along the circumference and measure the received power at each antenna and plot the value with horizontal axis = location of receiver antenna and vertical axis = measured energy level (power). How would the\nplot look like ?\n\nTest C) Now let's think about two test environment. In one setup there is no obstacles between the reciever and transmitter antenna (Let's call this as 'Setup A'). In the other setup, there are a lot of obstacles (like building, tree, houses, mountain etc) between the transmitter antenna and reciever antenna (Let's call this as 'Setup B'). Then you do the measurement described in Test\nB) for both setup and compare the result. Would you see any difference ? what kind of difference would you see ?\n\nThese three test will be used as a basis for modeling following cases. (Details will come later)\n\nThe first thing we can think of is a kind of ideal case called 'Free Space'. In this case, we assume that there is no obstacles between the transmitter and reciever antenna.\n\nIn this case, the measured power at every reciever antenna at the same distance from the transmitter antenna would be same and the received signal power can be modeled as follows. (Basically this equation is a form of Frris' Transmission Equation )\n\nIf you want to convert this equation to a form which most of RF engineers are more familiar with (dBm scale), you can just apply 10 log( ) on both side and go through following steps. Of course, you don't have to memorize the each of these steps. Just try to understand overall concept and logic of this process.\n\nLife would be much easier if the condition between the transmission antenna and reciever antenna is always as decribed in previous case (Free Space).\n\nIn real life situation, it is highly likely that you would see a lot of obstacles (like building, Tree, mountain etc). If I draw this situation in a little bit simplified way, it would be as follows.\n\nThe path loss at a certain distance can be expressed as follows. Compare this with the free space case. What kind of difference do you see ?\n\nIn case of free space model, once the distance is determined the received power can be determined automatically meaning that if d is fixed(same), you would get the same measured value (recieved power) for every measurement. But in this case, you cannot gurantee the same measured value even though the distance is same. Even though d is same, you would get the different measured value if beta\n(Path Loss Exponent) is different or epsilon (Random Variable) is different.\n\nThen the question would be 'How the Path Loss Exponent and Random Variable is determined ?'. There is no strict theory that can determine these values deterministically. It is usually determined empirically. According to various researches,\n\nIf you apply Log (10 log[ ] more specifically) to both side, you can get a linear equation in dB (dBm) scalse as shown below.\n\nA defining characteristic of the mobile wireless channel is to build up a mathematical model for the variations of the channel strength over time and over frequency. There are mainly two factors influencing the variations of the channel strength as listed below.\n\nAs a starting point, please... please ... please ... read very carefully about the section of Signal Presentation, Impulse Response and Convolution section before you go deeper into this section.\n\nLet's suppose we have a case as shown below. A UE is communicating with a eNodeB and there is a lot of building between the UE and the eNodeB. You may intuitively guess the eNodeB would get the multiple copies of the same signal from UE because the same signal can reach the eNodeB via multiple path as shown below. Let's assume that we have four different path as shown below. There are two\nmajor characteristics of the paths. One is attenuation and the other one is time delay. Of course there would be several additional factors, but these two components would be the largest factors. Let's assume that each of the path has the delay and attenuation as shown below.\n\nHow do we represent a channel using these delay and attenuator factor ? There can be a couple of different ways to represent it, but one of the most common way would be to represent it as an impulse response model. Even though you may not familiar with the term 'impulse response', you may have seen this kind of description if you have any experience of using channel simulators (fader) and\ndealt with fading profile. Following is the graphical representation of impulse response of the four paths in this example and physical meaning of it. I hope this make sense to you.\n\nIf you represent this impulse response into a mathematical form, it become as follows. If you are not familiar with this kind of mathematical representation. Read again the section of Signal Representation. (When you are first learning this way of signal representation.. you may think .. what the hell is delta function\n? Why we need this kind of function ? etc... this is one example why you need to learn those textbook concept).\n\nLet's look into a example that (hopefully) would give you more concrete understanding of these concepts.\n\nLet's suppose that a signal goes through six different path (multipath) as indicated in plot (1). Horizontal axis represents the time delay from the transmission to arrival at the reciever antenna. Vertical axis indicates the amplitude of the received signal. plot(2)~(7) shows the signal going through each path reaching to Rx antenna. If you look at each plots, you would notice that the phase\n(time delay) and amplitude are different from each other. plot (8) shows the summation of all the plots from (2) through (6). This is the signal being sensed by the recieving antenna.\n\nWhat do you observe from the plot (8) (the sum of all the multipath signal) ? You would notice that the amplitude and phase gets different from the transmitted signal, but overall shape of the signal is same as the transmitted signal. It means that no distortion happened by this multipath.\n\nNow let's think of how the received signal is influenced by the multipath with the frequency of the transmitted signal. I created plots for three different frequency (In this case, the amplitude of transmitted signal are same for all frequencies). As you see at plot (8) of each case (w=1,2,5), the amplitude of the total received signal gets different depending on frequency.\n\nNote : This shows the cases of only three different frequencies. Isn't there any way of showing the amplitude of total received signal for all the different frequencies in easier way ? We will look into this shortly.\n\nFollowing is the Octave source code (I think this would work with Matlab as well) for the graphs shown above, try playing the list 'a' and 'tau', get some intuitive understanding on your own.\n\nplot(t,real(exp_iwt)); xlim([0 2]);ylim([-1 1]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[-1 0 1]);\n\nplot(t,imag(exp_iwt)); xlim([0 2]);ylim([-1 1]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[-1 0 1]);\n\nplot(t,real(exp_iwt_sum),'r-'); xlim([0 2]);ylim([-3 3]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[-3 0 3]);\n\nplot(t,imag(exp_iwt_sum),'r-'); xlim([0 2]);ylim([-3 3]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[-3 0 3]);\n\nplot(w,real(Hw)); xlim([0 wmax]);ylim([-1 1]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[-1 0 1]);\n\nplot(w,imag(Hw)); xlim([0 wmax]);ylim([-1 1]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[-1 0 1]);\n\nplot(w,abs(Hw)); xlim([0 wmax]);ylim([0 1]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[0 1]);\n\nplot(w,real(Hw_sum),'r-'); xlim([0 wmax]);ylim([-5 5]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[-5 0 5]);\n\nplot(w,imag(Hw_sum),'r-'); xlim([0 wmax]);ylim([-5 5]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[-5 0 5]);\n\nplot(w,abs(Hw_sum),'r-'); xlim([0 wmax]);ylim([0 5]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[0 5]);\n\nNow we have a channel described in the form of impulse response. Let's suppose that we have a signal x(t) going through the channel. The x(t) will split into multiple pathes in the channel and take the different route and finally recombine at the receiver antenna. What would the signal at the receiving antenna look like ? There is an excellent mathematical tool to give you the answer to this\nquestion. It is a tool called 'Convolution'. If you just take the convolution of channel impulse response and input signal (x(t)), you would take the signal at the receiving antenna.\n\nWhen we specify a Fading Channel profile, we are usually given a table with tap delay and relative power for each tap. You may visualize the table as shown below. Usually those profile table in the specification does not specify statistical information for the tap, but usually some specific statistical profile is associated with each tap. In case of LTE channel profile (Tap Delay Line : TDL), usually each tap is associated with statistical power profile as shown below. Usually the first tap indicates the fading on line of sight path that is modeled in Rician distribution and the remaining taps indicates the fading channel on non line of sight path that is modeled in Rayleigh distribution.\n\nWhen it comes to using this channel profile in fading implementation, I would take this as the impulse response of the fading channel. Then, the modeling of a signal passing through a fading channel can be represented as the convolution of signal and the fading channel as illustrated below.\n\nSound simple ? Yes simple conceptually, but there is a difficulties in reality. It is about how to apply the statistically property associated with each tap.\n\nEach tap is associated with a specific statistical power and doppler profile. It mean that the power for each tap for each steps of convolution changes and the frequency shift for each tap for each steps of convolution changes according to specific statistical profile as illustrated below.\n\nApplying these changing impulse response, the faded signal is generated as illustrated below. (In real implementation, there are various techniques are used to generate this kind of varing channel impulse response. One widely used mathology is to use Jake's model).\n\nIn addition to this delay, gain, PDF, we have to think about the correlations among all the antenna on transmitter and reciever side as follows.\n\nThese correlation is defined in 3GPP as shown below and this correlation matrix should be applied to the Fading model when we use multiple antenna configuration.\n\nDo you see any difference between the matrix shown above (channel matrix) for 2 x 2 MIMO and the correlation matrix as shown below for 2 x 2 case ?\n\nOne obvious difference is size of the matrix. The channel matrix shown above is 2x2 matrix and the correlation matrix for 2 x 2 case shown below is 4x4.\n\nAny idea on how the 2x2 matrix show above is converted to 4 x 4 matrix shown below ?\n\n(The full correlation matrices is obtained by Tensor Product/Kronecker product\nof two antenna correlation matrix)\n\nLet's start with the simplest case and add piece by piece until we reach more realistic (complex) cases.\n\nLet's suppose that you have two Tx antenna and one Rx antenna. If draw this situation as in channel model, you can draw this setup as follows. (Let's call this a Case A)\n\nIn this setup, you have two channel path(channel coefficient) h1 and h2. Now let's think about all the possible relation between these two channel. If you draw all the possible relationships as a diagram, you may represent as follows.\n\nIf you represent these relationship between the two channel path (channel coefficient) in a matrix format, you can represent it as follows. (I would not explain it in detail but you would need to have some intuitive understanding of vector/matrix. This is why you should have taken such a boring linear algebra course in the university. If you are really new to this vector/matrix concept,\nVector/Matrix page on this site). Be careful, you may get confused with 2 x 2 matrix to be used to model 2 x 2 MIMO channel. (At least I was confused a lot at the beginning. I would not talk too much about it, but I strongly recommend you to compare the two matrix and clearly understand the difference between them). Just to give you the conclusion about the difference between the two matrix, the matrix shown\nhere represents the correlation between each channel path(the path the signal flow through) and the matrix shown in channel model represents the correlation between Tx and Rx antenna.\n\nThe 'Beta' value represents the cross correlation between channel coefficient h1 and h2.\n\nNow we have a different case. In this case, you have two Tx antenna and one Rx antenna. If draw this situation as in channel model, you can draw this setup as follows. (Let's call this a Case B)\n\nIf you represent these relationship between the two channel path (channel coefficient) in a diagram, you can represent it as follows.\n\nIf you represent these relationship between the two channel path (channel coefficient) in a matrix format,, you can represent it as follows.The 'Alpha' value represents the cross correlation between channel coefficient h1 and h2.\n\nNow let's look into more complicated case. In this case, you have two transmitter antenna and two reciever antenna. The antenna and channel path can be illustrated as follows. You can think of this as a combination of Case A and Case B described above.\n\nNow if you represents the correlations between each of these channel coefficients, it can be represented as follows.\n\nAs you did in case A and B, if you represents these correlations in vector/matrix format, you would get a big matrix as follows. How did you get the last matrix ?. Actually it came from the matrix for Case A and B described above. If you clearly understood the meaning of Beta and Alpha in Case A and B, you would easily understand how each of the elements in this big matrix can be represented\nas 'Alpha' or 'Beta'.\n\nwhat about the '?' part shown above ? Filling out these '?' is not so straigtforward. If you brow the statical concept (I cannot explain though :)), those parts are the places where the correlation between part of Case A and part of Case B and can be filled as follows.\n\nHow to derive MIMO coeifficient matrix mathematically from Diversity coefficient matrix ?\n\nI have explained how we got 2x2 MIMO correlation matrix from physical perspective and the each elements of 2 x 2 MIMO matrix can be derived from the elements of 2x1 Diversity matrix. I strongly recommend you to try to get familiar with this concept and build your own intuition. But as the number of antenna increases, deriving all the correlation matrix as I described above would not be that\neasy. Fortunately there is a mathematical way of deriving the MIMO correlation matrix from Diversity Correlation matrix. The MIMO correlation matrix can be derived by taking Kronecker product of two Diversity matrix as shown below. (If you are not familar with the concept of Kronecker product, refer to this page)\n\nThe last component I want to show you about Fading is Doppler spread. Doppler spread is caused by the well known phenomenon called 'Doppler Shift' (I would not explain what Doppler shift is. Everybody would learned about this from High school physics and you can easily google out a lot of explanation of this effect).\n\nDoppler spread can be expressed as shown in following function and plot. If you think of 'Doppler spread' as a kind of filter (or a block in a control system model). You can take the following function as a kind of transfer function of the filter.\n\nAs you see, how much a frequency (fc) get spreaded by doppler spread is indicated by fm. If you see another formula below the graph representing fm, you would see fm is determined by the velocity of object (relative velocify between transmitter and reciever) and speed of light and fc(carrier frequency). You know fc is constant (set by standard and assume hardware is good enough to maintain\nthe fc the same). Now the only variable is the speed v. According to this equation, fm and v are in proportional relation, meaning if v gets higher, fm gets larger (the width of the graph gets wider) and if v gets smaller, fm gets smaller (the width of the graph gets narrower).\n\nHow this kind of plot is obtained ? What is the meaning of this plot. Let's think a little bit further into how we get this plot.\n\nLet's assume that a car (e.g, a phone in a car) is moving in horizontal direction and it is receiving a signal with an angle illustrated as in (A). Since the car is moving, the phone in the car would experience doppler shift. Since the UE is getting the signal with an angle, the doppler shift it percieves can be represented as in red arrow in (B).\n\nNow let's extend this situation further to the situation where the UE in the moving car is receiving the signal from all direction as illustrated below. This is the situation where the UE has so many reflectors around it and recieves the multipath signal all around. Then the doppler shift that UE percieves is like red dots marked on the horizontal line. If you plot those red dots in probability distribution function, you will get the red plot as shown below.\n\nNow you may have question. How differently the narrow Doppler spread and wide doppler spread affect on the signal ?\n\nThe simulation result for these two cases (narrow and wide doppler spread) is shown below. The upper track is for narrow doppler spread and the lower track is for wide doppler spread. As you see, you see much frequency energy fluctuation over time in wide Doppler spectrum. I will update the page later about the mathmatical background.\n\nIf you are using a phone in high speed train, the distance between UE and eNB changes very fast. It means both UE and eNB will be under drastic doppler shift.\n\nFor example, let's suppose the train is traveling right into the eNB as illustrated below (the eNB is right on top of the railway). Of course, you don't see this kind of situation in real life. The train will crash into the eNB in this case. However, just suppose this is possible and train can go through a ghost-like eNB. In this case and assume that the speed of the train is constant, the doppler shift will stay constant as well. The only change is the direction of frequency shift changes as the train pass through eNB as illustrated below.\n\nHowever, in realy you don't see any case shown above in real life. In real life, the eNB is located away from the rail way at certain distance.\n\nIn this case, the Doppler Shift changes as the train get closer to, pass by and farther away from the eNB. The doppler shift at a specific time is represented as shown below (36.101 B.3)\n\nWhere does this equation come from ? It turned out to be from hunior high school geometry, but it took me long time to understand this since there is no background information in 3GPP.\n\nThis model is based on the assumption that the eNBs are spaced equaly and the train moves at a constant speed. It is also assumed that the initial location of the train (the location at t = 0) on the railway is at the mid point between two adjacent eNBs as shown below. Dmin is defined as the closest possible distance between UE and eNB and the initial location is specified to be half way between two adjacent eNBs. Then, the distance between the eNB and the train can be derived. If we define the angle theta as shown below, the cos(theta) will become as below.\n\nNow let's look into a snapshot after t seconds. Now the location of the train on the railway and the distance between UE and eNB, and the cos(theta) is derived as shown below. (Just try to derive on your own or just copy it with a pen on a paper, you will understand it clearly).\n\nIf you plot the doppler shift with time as traing travel along the railway, it would be illustrated as shown below.\n\nFollowing is the Matlab code that I wrote based on the equation shown above. In this, I calculated not only frequency shift but also the angle(theta) to figure out the location of the train more easily.\n\nNow let's do some experiment with the code to understand the impact of the parameters. The first experiment is to change the speed of the train keeping all other parameters same. The doppler shift that UE (on the train) will experience can be plotted as shown below. See if this is aligned with your intuitive understanding.\n\nNow let's do another experiement. In this experiement, I changed Dmin keeping all other parameters same. The doppler shift that UE (on the train) will experience can be plotted as shown below. See if this is aligned with your intuitive understanding.\n\nTypical model for Fading channel can be described by a simple diagram as follows. This is very simplified model but fortunately this is almost enough for 3GPP specification for fading test. As you see, a signal comes into the fading block and splits into multiple path. Each path has three components, namely Delay, PDF, Gain component. By changing these parameters in each path,\nyou can construct pretty complicated fading channel.\n\nIn LTE 3GPP specification, typical three types of Fading profiles are defined as follows.\n\nGo through following pages (examples) and try to get some intuitive understanding on your own.\n\n[2] Rayleigh Fading Channels in Mobile Digital Communication Systems.

The feedback signalling consists of Hybrid-ARQ Acknowledgement (HARQ-ACK) and Channel-Quality Indication (CQI), in case the UE is configured in MIMO mode or in MIMO mode with four transmit antennas Precoding Control Indication (PCI) as well and in case the UE is configured in MIMO mode with four transmit antennas the number of transport blocks preferred (NTBP) as well [3].

The CQI, in case the UE is configured in MIMO mode also the PCI, and in case the UE is configured in MIMO mode with four transmit antennas also the PCI and the number of UE preferred transport blocks are carried in the second and third slot of a HS-DPCCH sub-frame.

In order to fulfil these requirements, appropriate charging information needs to be generated and collected by the network elements or network functions of the 3GPP network and forwarded to appropriate charging and billing systems.\n\nSeveral logical charging functions are needed in the network in order to provide the functionality described above for online and offline charging, respectively. These charging functions are specified in detail in this clause, together with the reference points and service based interface that are used to transfer charging information between those functions. While the overall possibilities that exist within the 3GPP standards for the physical mapping of these logical functions are described in the present document, the exact situation that applies to the various domains, subsystems and services of the network is specified in the middle tier TS that is specific to that domain/subsystem/service (i.e. TS 32.25x, TS 32.26x and TS 32.27x).\n\nIn offline charging, the charging information is transferred from the network to the Billing Domain (BD), where it is processed for billing and/or statistical purposes, at the discretion of the PLMN operator. While the internal functions of the BD are outside the scope of 3GPP standardisation, the reference point for the charging information transfer from the network to the BD does form a part of the 3GPP standards and is therefore also specified in the present clause.\n\nIn online charging, the charging information is transferred from the network to the Online Charging System (OCS) or to the Converged Charging System (CCS). The OCS or CCS, in turn, may have an offline charging reference point used to forward charging information to the BD that is similar in scope and intent to the offline charging case described in the previous paragraph. Those areas of the OCS and CCS that form part of the 3GPP standards (functions, reference points and service based interface) are also described in the present clause. All other aspects of the OCS and CCS are outside the scope of 3GPP.",

    "context": "https://www.sharetechnote.com/html/Handbook_LTE_LTEU_LTER.html\n\nLTE Adv: LAA/LTE-U\n\nRecently (from 2014 as far as I remember), there has been pretty much discussion (even real testing going on) on LTE being extended to non-standard mode of operation (Non 3GPP yet at least up to this point, as of Jan 2015).\n\nNote : In early second half of 2016, I saw a company to try LTE-U device for the first timie, and as it approaches to the end of the year, I saw many companies testing LTE-U devices. Now in early 2017 we are at the stage of testing LAA.\n\nTwo of the technology falling into this category is LTE-U and LTE-R. LTE-U has been proposed and start being implemented in the industry for about a year and LTE-R just start being proposed as Integrated wireless railway network to be commercialized .\n\nAs of Jun 2016, I don't see/hear anything about LTE-R.. but I saw the drastic evolution of unlicensed LTE that created several different technologies (names) to the list. It started with LTE-U and evolved to LAA, eLAA and recently we are hearing of new branches like MulteFire and LWA. I don't know how many other technologies are waiting to be newly evolved and which of these technologies\nwill survive to the end.. some of them are now pretty well defined but there are a lot of other features to be defined technically. I will keep following them up and try to write down whatever has been clarified.\n\nFollowings are the brief descriptions for each of these technologies. I will put further details under separate section if more technical details are published. Also, I put many whitepapers and YouTube links under Reference section. I would recommend you to go through those materials when you have free time and use this page as reminder afterwards. (The contents of this table\nis mostly based on Ref [7] )\n\nFollowings are the list of topics that gives you further details of various LTE-Unlicensed technologies.\n\nIn every wireless communication, the communicating parties (transmitter and reciever) need to allocatie a certain amount of resources in both time domain and frequency domain. However, we don't have much control over frequency domain resource allocation because those resources are fixed permanently or semi-statically. So it is usually not in the scope of scheduling. When it comes to scheduling, Time Domain resource allocation tend to be more important.\n\nIn 3GPP based technology (i.e, Cellular Communication Technology like LTE), the time domain scheduling is obvious and determinstic even when there are many devices are in communication because all of the time domain resources determined by the central master (Base Station /Node B/eNode B). However, in 802.11 based technology(i.e LAN, Wireless LAN etc) there is no central controling master in terms of scheduling. In this case, there is always possibility that transmission signal from one device interfere with communication of other devices. To prevent (or at least reduce) this situation, we need a special algorithm for Time Domain Scheduling. Time Domain Scheduling in this case mean 'Determine when to transmit and how long it transmit'.\n\nThen why we need to care of this kind of thing in LTE-Unlicensed technology ? Basically LTE Unlicensed technology (e.g, LTE-U, LAA etc) refer to a technology in which LTE operates in 802.11 frequency region. So LTE need to keep the rule set by 802.11 in order not to prevent the communiction between existing 802.11 devices.\n\nThere are many variations of the time domain scheduling, but the basic idea and logic is same. Basic idea is 'Your transmission should not interfere with communication between others' and the basic logic is 'Before you transmit anything, check if the chennel(medium) is already being used by others'. This logic can be illustrated as follows.\n\nThen you may have some questions as follows : How to check (i.e, how to figure out) whether the channel (medium) is being used by other ? and how long the device need to check before it make any decision ?\n\nIn the effort to answer these questions, you will come across many terms that may confuse you for so long. I tried to list up those confusing words and how these are related to each other in following illustration. If you are new to this area, I would suggest you to understand 'what is CS and ED ?' first and then try to understand how CS / ED is used in higher level technology like CSMA/CD, CSMA/CA, CCS, LBT, CSAT etc. Already feel headache ? :)\n\nCS / ED : CS stands for Carrier Sensing and ED stands for Energy Detection. The fundamental concept is same. The term CS is more frequently used in 802.11 area especially for Wired LAN Area. In this technology, the device measures the energy level in the channel (medium) mostly in the form of voltage and compares the measured voltage with a specified value (threshold value). ED stands for Energy Detection. it is more frequently used in wireless/cellular technology. In this method, the device measures the energy level in the channel (medium) mostly in the form of Power and compares the measured power with a specified value (threshold value)\n\nCSMA/CD or CSMA/CA : As the term CSMA(Carrier Sensing Multiple Access) implies, these are technology of figuring out whether a channel is available or not based on CS method. You don't need to know the details of thechnology under the context of LTE-Unlicensed technology, but if you are really interested in thses method refer to CSMA/CD and CSMA/CA page.\n\nCCA : CCA stands for Clear Channel Assessment. As the word implies, this is a method to figure out the channel is clear (i.e, nobody is using the channel). CCA perform ED(Energy Detection) for a certain period of time and make a decision whether the channel is clear or not. It is a common method being used in 802.11 (WLAN) technology.\n\nHow long CCA perform ED before it make decision ? It depends on higher layer technology (e.g, 802.11 FHSS, 802.11 OFDM, LBT). However, the minimum time span is 18 us sec.\n\nWhat is the threshold energy level to make decision whether the channel is being used by some other device or not ? This also varies depending on power class of the device and reciever antenna gain. However, the base threshold is -70 dBm.\n\nNOTE : Refer to 802.11 specification and ETSI EN 300 328 if you want to get full details and requirement for CCA.\n\nLBT: LBT stands for Listen Before Talk. According to ETSI EN 300 328, LBT is defined as 'mechanism by which an equipment applies clear channel assessment (CCA) before using the channel' (In this document, you can find a couple of variations of LBT depending on different situations). As you see in the terminology itself, 'Listen Before Talk' indicate two major process, the first one is 'Listen' and the second part is 'Talk'. The meaning of 'Talk' is obvious. It means 'Transmit Data'. The tricky part is 'what does it exactly mean by 'Listen''. In more technical definition, 'Listen' mean 'perform CCA(Clear Channel Assessment)'. You can find a more detailed description on LBT in IEEE P802.19-08/0034r0 (The specific value (i.e, transmission time, threshold value may vary depending on application, but I think this explains overal LBT mechanism in easier way than other documents).\n\nCSAT : CSAT stands for Carrier Sensing Adaptive Transmission. CSAT is very similar to CSMA or LBT(Listen Before Talk), the main difference is that CSAT monitors(senses) the medium for much longer duration (around tens of msec to 200 msec) comparing to normal WiFi CSMA, so that it would not interfere not only with WiFi\ndata transmission (QoS traffic) but also with more sporadic transmission like discovery signals (Ref [2]). Unlike other techiques described in this section (defined with focus on 802.11 technology), CSAT is defined by LTE-U Forum with focus on 3GPP technology.\n\nIn LTE, every transmission within a specified spectrum is well managed/scheduled both for downlink and uplink. So Network can figure out exactly when to transmit something and when UE will transmit something.. but in Unlicensed band transmission and reception by the existing WiFi device is not as predictable as in LTE. Basically anybody can transmit in anytime as long as it complies with\nCSMA/CA procedure.\n\nIn this kind of situation, how LTE network can schedule transmission in Unlicensed band ?\n\nOne method is for LTE cell to perform a special channel selection procedure and allocate the channel only when it is clean. \nIn channel selection process, network measures the energy level within the allowed band and use those area in which the energy level is under a certain threshold (e.g, -62 dBm over 20 Mhz BW).\n\nThe Cell performs this kind of channel selection algorithm in on-going mode and if needed it will select more suitable channel and switch to it.\n\nWhat if you (a Cell) fail to find any clean channel at the initial channel selection process ?\n\nIn this case, the cell use another mechanism called CSAT (Carrier-Sensing Adaptive Transmission). Technically, CSAT is very similar to CSMA or LBT(Listen Before Talk), the main difference is that CSAT monitors(senses) the medium for much longer duration (around tens of msec to 200 msec) comparing to normal WiFi CSMA, so that it would not interfere not only with WiFi\ndata transmission (QoS traffic) but also with more sporadic transmission like discovery signals (Ref [2]).\n\nAccording to Reference [5], there seems to be roughly three levels of Coexistence strategy regarding LTE-U. Most of these techniques are already mentioned in previous section, but let me rewrite in a little bit different words.\n\nChannel Selection : This says \"Use WiFi band only when it is not being used (i.e, the band is clean)\". To figure out whether it is being used or not, you have to measure the engergy level of the target band as described above.\n\nTime-domain coexistence techniques : Even when it fail to find any clean channel in channel selection stage, there is still some chance. Even though there is no clean channel at the point of channel selection, there might be some empty slots if you look at the time domain scheduling with relatively high granularity.\nTo find out this kind of time domain opportunity and in order not to make an interference at any time, they are considering several different technology like CSAT, eCSAT, LBT. My personal question were 'do we have to support all these technology everywhere (every devices)?'. This question was answered by Reference [5] as follows.\n\nFor non listen-before-talk (LBT) markets such as the US, South Korea, China and India, CSAT (Carrier Sensing Adaptive Transmission) can be used without changing Rel-10 Carrier Aggregation protocols for co-channel coexistence. For LBT markets such as Europe and Japan, Rel-13 LAA will enable channel sharing with Wi-Fi by performing clear channel assessment (CCA) based channel availability sensing and adapting the transmission duration on a fine timescale, ranging from 1ms-10ms\n\nOpportunistic SCell operation : To me, this sounds like a rule (not a technology). Basically this says \"Use the unlicensed band only when it is really necessary (e.g, in real demand on high throughput or when the primary cell is overloaded). Release the unlicensenced and fall back to anchor carrier when\nthe demand for unlicenced band is not critical.\n\nInterplay of these coexistance technical components are well illustrated as follows in Ref [2].\n\nLTE-U stands for LTE-Unlicensed. This is the first real implementation of the whole LTE-Unlicensed family as far as I remember. Since this is already implemented and tested relatively widely and a lot of details are known, I thought I got enough information to write this subject in a separate page. Refer to LTE-U page for the details.\n\nIn other LTE-Unlincensed technology, LTE borrow only radio spectrum from WLAN and all the transmission/reception technology except radio spectrum purely based on LTE. However, in LWA LTE borrows not only WLAN radio spectrum but also WLAN Access Point for transmitting data. This key difference is illustrated as below. To implement this key difference, we would need to implement many other\ntechnical components. The most important part would be to implmenet special interface between LTE eNB and WLAN AP. Then you may ask.. at which layer the eNB and WLAN will be connected ? It would be quicker to interact if they can get connected at lower layer (e.g, PHY/MAC), but LTE PHY/MAC and WLAN PHY/MAC is completely different.. so hard to make any connection at this layer. So they will use higher layer (specifically PDCP) for this connection. As you know, there is no PDCP layer in WLAN. So connecting at PDCP\nlayer might be a little bit misleading. More accruately speaking, LTE PDCP packet will be encapsulated into WLAN MAC frame.\n\nNow LWA is defined in 3GPP specification and I created a separate page for 3GPP LWA because it will be a long story. Refer to LWA page for the 3GPP details.\n\nAround the end of 2016, I start hearing of implementing this both on UE modem and Network, UE testing equipment side. Now (as of early 2017) I am hearing of testing this feature on real UE. So I decided to create separate page for this. Read LAA page for the details.\n\nPutting very simple way, Multipath Aggregation (more formally Multipath TCP Aggregation : mptcp) is LTE-WLAN aggregation at TCP level as illustrated below. The key component in this architecture would be MP Proxy (Multipath Proxy) and this part is being defined in IETF (Ref [12] )\n\nAs of now (Jan 2015), I don't have any specific information other than Integrated wireless railway network to be commercialized .\n\n[1] LTE-U/LAA, MuLTEfire and Wi-Fi; making best use of unlicensed spectrum (Qualcomm)\n\n[9] Cracking Google Project Fi & LTE/Wi-Fi Aggregation with Qualcomm - Wi-Fi Now Episode 5 (YouTube)\n\n[10] The LTE-U vs. Wi-Fi debate continues empowering carriers with seamless Wi-Fi - Wi-Fi Now Episode 15 (YouYube)\n\n[15] ETSI EN 300 328 Wideband transmission systems;Data transmission equipment operating in the 2,4 GHz ISM band and using wide band modulation techniques;",

The SON architecture can be a centralized, distributed or a hybrid solution.\n\nThis is the dynamic plug-and-play configuration of newly deployed eNBs. The eNB will by itself configure the Physical Cell Identity, transmission frequency and power, leading to faster cell planning and rollout.\n\nThe interfaces S1 and X2 are dynamically configured, as well as the IP address and connection to IP backhaul. To reduce manual work ANR (Automatic neighbour relations) is used. ANR configures the neighbouring list in newly deployed eNBs and is optimizing the list configuration during operation.\n\nDynamic configuration includes the configuration of the Layer 1 identifier, Physical cell identity (PCI) and Cell global ID (CGID). There are 504 different PCIs available in LTE, the PCI mapping shall fulfill the collision free condition as well as the confusion free. The PCI can be assigned either in a centralized or distributed way.\n\nWhen centralised assignment is used the OAM system will have a complete knowledge and control of the PCIs. When the distributed solution is used the OAM system assigns a list of possible PCIs to the newly deployed eNB, but the adoption of the PCI is in control of the eNB. The newly deployed eNB will request a report, sent either by User Equipment (UEs) over the air interface or by other eNBs over the X2 interface, including already in-use PCIs, see figure 1. - The eNB will randomly select its PCI from the remaining values.\n\nANR is used to minimize the work required for configuration in newly deployed eNBs as well as to optimize configuration during operation. Correct and up-to-date neighbouring lists will increase the number of successful handovers and minimize the number of dropped calls. Before a handover can be executed the source eNB requires the neighbouring information: PCI and CGID of the target eNB.\n\nThe PCI is included in every normal measurement report. The mapping between the PCI and CGID parameters can be done by using information from the OAM or reported by UEs decoding the target cell CGID on the broadcast channel in the target cell, see figure 2. The capability of decoding CGID is an optional UE feature.\n\nA network operator can put a cell on a ANR black list, to block certain handover candidates, for example from indoor to outdoor cells. 3GPP has also specified LTE Inter-Frequency and Inter-RAT (Radio Access Technology) ANR.\n\nFunctions for self-optimisation are mainly included in Release 9. It includes optimisation of coverage, capacity, handover and interference.\n\nMobility load balancing (MLB) is a function where cells suffering congestion can transfer load to other cells, which have spare resources. MLB includes load reporting between eNBs to exchange information about load level and available capacity.\n\nThe periodicity of the reporting can be requested in the range of 1 to 10 s. The report can contain, hardware load, S1 transport network load and Radio resource status. The Radio resource status reports are separated in Up Link and Down Link reports, including the total allocation guaranteed and non-guaranteed bit rate traffic, the percentage of allocated Physical Resource Block (PRB) and the percentage of PRBs available for load balancing.\n\nMLB can also be used between different Radio Technologies. In case of inter-RAT the load reporting RAN Information Management (RIM) protocol will be used to transfer the information via the core between the base stations of different radio technologies. A cell capacity class value, set by the OAM-system, will be used to compare and weigh the different technologies radio capacities against each other.\n\nA handover due to load balancing is carried out as a regular handover, but it may be necessary to amend parameters so that the User Equipment (UE) does not return to the congested cell. The amendment must take place in both cells, so that the handover settings remain coherent in both. The eNBs need to estimate how much the cell border needs to be shifted, expressed in dB, to avoid a quick return of the UE.\n\nMobility robustness optimization (MRO) is a solution for automatic detection and correction of errors in the mobility configuration. In Release 9 the focus is on errors causing Radio link failure (RLF) due to too late or early handover, or handover to an incorrect cell.\n\nIn case of late handover, see figure 3, the handover procedure in the source cell is initialized too late, since the UE is moving faster than the Handover (HO) parameter settings allow. Hence when the RRC HO command from the serving cell is transmitted the signal strength is too weak to reach the UE, now located in the target cell, connection is lost. The UE attempts a connection re-establishment, containing PCID and C-RNTI belonging to the source cell, but received by the target cell. The target eNB will then inform the source cell about RLF to adjust Handover parameters.\n\nIt is a bit more complicated to detect a too early handover, see figure 4. The UE has successfully been handed over from source cell A to target cell B, but since it was triggered too early the connection will drop almost immediately due to too poor radio conditions in the target cell B. The UE will then try to re-establish the connection, which will now take place in the original source cell, cell A, since this cell is the strongest one. The UE will use the PCID and RNTI from the target cell B and the source cell A will then consider this as a Radio Link Failure due to too late handover and send an indication to the target cell B. But the target cell B will now recognize the parameters in the indication, as given to a mobile that had just completed a handover to cell B from cell A now indicating failure. The target cell B will send back a report about too early Handover to adjust Handover parameters, to the source cell A.\n\nIn order to save energy some cells can be switched off when capacity is not needed. The power consumption in a base station is not only related to load, a number of functions requires power even if there are no users to serve. But, if a cell is switched off, in the legal operator license there are still requirements on coverage, the coverage must be maintained at all times! The suspension of the cell may occur when the last user leaves the cell, all incoming handovers during this period of time will then be rejected. The cells that remain on, providing coverage, can wake up a suspended cell when traffic load increase. This can be done with a wake-up call to the sleeping cell.\n\nRACH optimisation aims to minimise the number of attempts on the RACH channel, causing interference. The UE can be polled by the eNB for RACH statistics after connection. The number of preambles sent until successful RACH completion, and the number of contention resolution failure are in the statistics. But PRACH configuration parameters can also be distributed amongst eNBs, like zero correlation configuration, root sequence, high speed flag and PRACH frequency offset.\n\nFeatures for automatic detection and removal of failures and automatic adjustment of parameters are mainly specified in Release 10.\n\nCoverage and Capacity Optimization enables automatic correction of capacity problems depending on slowly changing environment, like seasonal variations.\n\nMinimization of drive tests (MDT), is enabling normal UEs to provide the same type of information as those collected in drive test. A great advantage is that UEs can retrieve and report parameters from indoor environments.",

    "context": "https://www.sharetechnote.com/html/WLAN_Security.html\n\nWiFi: Security\n\nWLAN Security is a special mechanism which allows only a specific person (machine) to get access to a specific WLAN Network. In more formal term, it is a mechanism to assure confidentiality and integrity of data flowing over WLAN network.\n\nSince this can easily be very dry topic and I don't have expert level knowledge of these algorithm, I want to try to describe this in more practical and intuitive level.\n\nBefore you jump into a bunch of boring documents about Security, I would recommend to get familiar with some terminologies you would come across in technical documents. One good way to get familiar with would be to have some time to take a little bit closer look at some tools that almost everybody have used at some point but never paid closer attention.\n\nFirst example is from WLAN setting on my own PC on the network that I am allowed to use. My WLAN interface has following types of Security options. You may see different options on your PC and your WLAN network. Don't try to understand everything in details here. Just get familiar with some terms of WPA, WPA2 or AES etc.\n\nHere goes another example. Following is from one of WiFi options shown on my mobile phone. You would also see a lot of new terminologies here. Again, just try to get familiar with the terms ..\n\nNow you would be wondering exactly where and how these algorithms play roles during WiFi attach or Data communication process. For this, I would recommend you to go through WiFi Protocol page and overall understanding of WiFi Protocol. And then take closer look at step 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11 of Sample log of WiFi Aattach process. (The detailed procedure and parameters in each step would vary depending on each algorithm but you would get a big picture from the page).\n\nNow with a little bit of familiarity with basic keywords and overall understanding on protocol, let's take a small step into some of commonly used security algorithm.\n\nYou can get a pretty good tutorial of overall concept of WLAN Security from the list of Video Tutorial at the bottom of the page.\n\nWEP stands for Wired Equivalent Privacy and it has following properties/functionalities.\n\nDrawback of WEP : Since there is no key management and uses shared key, every wireless station and AP has the same \"preshared\" key that is used during authentication and encryption. It means you have to manually distribute the key to every device and every AP and it would be very cumbersome to change key because once you change it and you have to redistribute them all manually. So usually every device will use the same/static key for a long time giving more chance for hackers to break the system.\n\nWPA stands for WiFi Protected Access. It is proposed as Interim solution that offers key management using the 802.1X authentication framework and performs improved encryption and integrity checking. It has following properties/functionalities.\n\nThis is a kind of WPA evolution and is specified in IEEE 802.16i. In most part, it is same as WPA but it uses improved encryption mechanism called AES.\n\nThere are many different types of WLAN Authentication methods and the list gets longer and longer. Followings are some of the common methods and I will keep update as I learn more.\n\nIn reality 'Open System Authentication' means 'No Authentication'. You would ask 'Is there anybody who really use this ?'.\n\nThe answer is Yes, largely for two reason. One is just using an Access Point for special testing purpose and in other more common situation is where you don't do any Authentication on AP (Access Point) level so you would set 'Open' in AP Security, but you let the packet goes through additional security system sitting behind AP. You would see this kind of methods being used in many company.\n\nStatus Code carries various information defined in 802.11 and it includes the status of whether attach is successful or not. Refer to 802.11 Association Status, 802.11 Deauth Reason codes for the details of the code.",

This service component controls the transfer of the trace records from the NEFs to the OSF. The conceptual model is illustrated in figure 5, which employs both the event report function (CCITT X.734 [14]) and the log control function (CCITT X.735 [15]).\n\nThe trace control function collects traceable events within the NEF and formats them into trace records. These trace records may be stored locally within the NEF filestore or transferred to the OSF in the form of event reports. This is controlled by means of the \"priority\" indicator, which is a part of the trace type. If the \"priority\" indicator is not set then the trace records shall stored within the local filestore and subsequently transferred to the OSF in bulk via FTAM.\n\nIf a trace is activated with the \"priority\" indicator set then the trace records shall be sent to the OSF either direct by the trace control function or through Event Forwarding Discriminators (EFDs).\n\nIf EFDs are used then all trace records are offered to the EFDs. The EFDs determine which of the records are to be transmitted to the OSF in the form of event reports and the Operation System Id field in the header is ignored. The EDFs have complex filter constructs, which allow the operator to define the criteria for destinations and filters.\n\nIf EFDs are not used then all priority records are forwarded to the OSF whose address is given in the Operation System Id field. The NEF is required to supply additional information to provide the OS management application entity title.\n\nFinally, the trace records may also be stored in the form of log entries within the log of the NEF. It is up to the operator to decide if the log function is needed in parallel with the event reporting and file store. Once stored, the log records may be individually accessed by the OSF via the appropriate object management functions. Care should be taken of filter criteria for log records to avoid unnecessary overheads.\n\nThis service component contains the following groups of TMN management functions:\n\n9.2\tTransfer of Records\n\n9.2.1\tBulk record transfer\n\nThis group of TMN functions is concerned with the bulk transfer of trace records from the NEF record filestore to the OSF.\n\nThe trace records shall be transferred from the NEF to the OSF by the use of FTAM services. For further details of the use of FTAM see GSM 12.01 [8].\n\nIn addition to the simple file transfer services provided by FTAM, peertopeer application process communication may also be supported. The use of CMIS services for the uploading of files from the NEF to the OSF is specified in the GSM 12.00 [7].\n\nWhen the procedure defined in GSM 12.00 [7] and GSM 12.01 [8] are used to transfer the trace records, the file type shall be traceRecords and the format of the file is given by the type TraceFileFormat.\n\n9.2.2\tLog control\n\nThis function permits the trace record to be stored and retrieved from logs within the NEF. The logging of these records is performed in accordance with the log control function specified in CCITT X.735 [15] and no additional management functions are required.\n\n9.2.3\tLog access\n\nThis TMN function controls the access to the log described above. Each log defined may contain one or more log entries. Each log entry contains a single trace record.\n\nFor further details concerning the use of logs, see CCITT X.735 [15].\n\nThe following system management functions are required:\n\n9.2.4\tEvent Reporting\n\n9.2.4.1\tEvent Forwarding Discriminators\n\nFor shortterm recording of tracing events and for more complicated filter conditions the event forwarding discriminator construct defined in CCITT X.734 [14] and CCITT X.721 [13] can be employed. The event forwarding discriminator construct is extremely flexible permitting the combination of a number of fields and logical operations with a wide variety of scheduling options. The EFD also controls the destinations to which the event reports are sent. Several such filters may be defined and scheduled for operation at different times and for different time periods.\n\nThe following system management functions are required:\n\n9.2.4.2\tDirect Transfer by Trace Control Function\n\nThis function permits the NEF to transmit trace records direct to the OSF. In general the trace record shall be sent on completion of the call or the traceable event. This function is controlled by means of the \"priority\" indicator, which is contained in the trace type. If the priority indicator is not set, then the trace records shall be stored on file within the NE filestore. These records may be subsequently collected via bulk record transfer as described in subclause 9.2.1. If the trace type specified on activation includes the \"priority\" indicator then all of the records shall be sent via trace reports to the OSF specified by the operation system id.\n\nThe following system management functions are required:",

    "context": "https://www.sharetechnote.com/html/IoT/IoT_WhatToChoose.html\n\nIoT: What to choose\n\nNow let's assume that you got the full unstanding of each of the IoT related technology individually and did a little bit of categorization, you may come up with some daisy chain like diagram as illustrated below.\n\nWhat is confusing you would not be the technical details of each individual technology. What confuse you would about 'how one technology differs from other technologies ?' or 'which technology I have to chose for my application or use model ?'\n\nThe simple answer to the question \"Which technology do I have to pick for my application or my use model ?\" is \"It depends on the nature of your application\".\n\nI know.. you would not take this as an answer. You would ask for more specific answers.\n\nIf you want to get more specific answers, you would have specific answers to a lot of specific questions as listed below. (This list would get extended as learn/observe more from various discussions/forums).\n\nI would not put my comments on each of the questions for now.. just to give you some time for you to think.. (good excuse for my laziness :)).\n\nThis is basically asking about the data rate of the end node in your IoT system. Is it collecting a simple data like Temperature, Humidity which takes up only several bytes at a time of transmission. Normally this kind of IoT device should be very low cost. It is less likely to let this kind of device to use relatively expensive network (like cellular network).\n\nThis is asking 'Are you going to use a simple sensors (like temperature, humidity) ?' or some other devices which requires a relatively large packet transmission/reception or which requires very high level data security.\n\nThis would be highly related to Q1. Usually the type of data to be collected and transmitted would determine the necessary data rate, but there might be some exceptions. For example, if you need very sophisticated data security and add a lot of additional portions to the original data to implement the security, the data rate that you would need would get much higher. Another exception can be the case where you want to upgrade/reconfigure your end-node remotely. Of course, this would not happen very often but if you really want to do this, the data rate should be pretty high for the end-node to download necessary firmware and configuration information.\n\nQ4. Does your end node device will both transmit and receive data ? or only transmit the data (no recieve) ?\n\nMost of the IoT application is Uplink centeric (transmission only in terms of end-device) and in some extreme case there are some application that is uplink only. It is understandable for most of IoT application to be Uplink dominant but there would be a lot of restriction if it goes with uplink only. For example, you have a very simple end-device (e.g, a temperature sensor) and transmitted it to a Gateway or Basestation. If the device is uplink only (transmission only), the device can only transmit the data and there is no way to verify whther it successfully reached the destination or not. To verify the successful transmission of the data, there should be some mechanism by which the destination (e.g, Gateway) can send Acknowledge message to the device that has sent the data. To do this, the system should allow downlink (i.e, reception in terms of end-device). Also, if you want to apply any form of data security or remote re-configuration or remote update, you need both uplink and downlink.\n\nLet me ask another question before this .. Are you going to use unlicensed band/frequency (i.e ISM band) or a licensed band / frequency (e.g, Cellular) ? If you decided to use ISM band, it is highly likely to use sub Ghz band (i.e, around 900 Mhz) or around 2.4 Ghz frequency. If you decided to use licensed band, it will be determined by which frequency will be allowed in the area where your IoT system will be installed.\n\nIf you selected unlicensed band, you are free to use any of the frequency .. but it is not only you who is free to use the frequency.. there might be a lot of other devices that uses the same frequency which might cause unwanted interference. If you decided to use the licensed frequency, there will be licensing / permission issue.\n\nIf the transmitter and reciever is communicating within the range of couple of meters or tens of meters, you can use many of the existing short range communication like Bluetooth, ZigBee etc. However, if it should extend to several km or tens of km, you have to use those technologies that can cover wide range like LPWAN (e.g, LoRa, SigFox etc) or Cellular technology.\n\nBasically IoT requires a cirtain type of Network structure whether it is small or large (in most case it is not peer to peer communication). Then you would have question on how to form such a network and how much control you want to have over the whole network. Some people would say 'I want to implement only the end Node(e.g, terminal sensor module) and get it connected to an exisiting network that are already established'. In this case, you would consider Cellular based IoT or SigFox. In this option, you would have less work to do but very limitted or no controllability for network. Some people would say 'I want to implement everything from the end node to the network and I want to have full control over the network'. In this case, you may like LoRa type of technology. You would have full controllability, but downside is that there are a lot of works for you to do.\n\nFor example, SKT deployed a Nation wide IoT service in South Korea around the end of 2016 based on LoRa technology. According to Ref [5], they were considering LoRa, SigFox, NB-LTE(and other LTE based IoT). LTE IoT was excluded for other reason, but between LoRa and SigFox, the controllability to Network was one of the factor to select LoRa.\n\nQ10. Do you need any security for the data being transmitted and received ? At which level, if you need ?\n\nI personally think this is pretty important issue since there are many cases where it is not easy to change / upgrade the software of a IoT end node once it is installed or take too much cost to visit every installation points and change software of the device. However, I don't see this issues widely discussed in the industry yet (as of early 2017). Probably they are afraid to bring up the issues that does not have any simple / easy solution. In theory, the smartest solution is to let the end node device itself to download the new software and upgrade it by itself. We have seen this type of software upgrade in cellular phone (smart phone) pretty commonly these days. We may think of utilizing the similar technologies to IoT devices. However, the biggest problem would be the bandwidth. Most of IoT device is designed for low data rate communication, but this kind of wireless software upgrade would take pretty big bandwidth. So if you think of this kind of wireless software upgrade, you would need to choose such a technology to provide big enough bandwidth for wireless woftware upgrade.\n\nQ12. What kind of protocol (phy, mac, application layer protocol) do you want to use ?\n\nThere are many different technologies that claim to be the best for IoT. Some of them would already be available at your time of deployment, but some technologies would be being talked a lot but not available or not mature yet. So if your deployment schedule is very near, you would need to choose a technology that are mature right now.\n\nFor example, SKT deployed a Nation wide IoT service in South Korea around the end of 2016 based on LoRa technology. According to Ref [5], they were considering LoRa, SigFox, NB-LTE(and other LTE based IoT). SigFox were excluded for other reason, but between LoRa and SigFox, LoRa was selected mainly due to availability. LoRa technology was already there when they were planning, but there were still a couple of years to go for LTE based IoT to be mature enough.\n\n[3] NarrowBand IoT Demystified: What are the benefits and why do we need it?

This service component controls the transfer of the trace records from the NEFs to the OSF. The conceptual model is illustrated in figure 5, which employs both the event report function (CCITT X.734 [14]) and the log control function (CCITT X.735 [15]).\n\nThe trace control function collects traceable events within the NEF and formats them into trace records. These trace records may be stored locally within the NEF filestore or transferred to the OSF in the form of event reports. This is controlled by means of the \"priority\" indicator, which is a part of the trace type. If the \"priority\" indicator is not set then the trace records shall stored within the local filestore and subsequently transferred to the OSF in bulk via FTAM.\n\nIf a trace is activated with the \"priority\" indicator set then the trace records shall be sent to the OSF either direct by the trace control function or through Event Forwarding Discriminators (EFDs).\n\nIf EFDs are used then all trace records are offered to the EFDs. The EFDs determine which of the records are to be transmitted to the OSF in the form of event reports and the Operation System Id field in the header is ignored. The EDFs have complex filter constructs, which allow the operator to define the criteria for destinations and filters.\n\nIf EFDs are not used then all priority records are forwarded to the OSF whose address is given in the Operation System Id field. The NEF is required to supply additional information to provide the OS management application entity title.\n\nFinally, the trace records may also be stored in the form of log entries within the log of the NEF. It is up to the operator to decide if the log function is needed in parallel with the event reporting and file store. Once stored, the log records may be individually accessed by the OSF via the appropriate object management functions. Care should be taken of filter criteria for log records to avoid unnecessary overheads.\n\nThis service component contains the following groups of TMN management functions:\n\n9.2\tTransfer of Records\n\n9.2.1\tBulk record transfer\n\nThis group of TMN functions is concerned with the bulk transfer of trace records from the NEF record filestore to the OSF.\n\nThe trace records shall be transferred from the NEF to the OSF by the use of FTAM services. For further details of the use of FTAM see GSM 12.01 [8].\n\nIn addition to the simple file transfer services provided by FTAM, peertopeer application process communication may also be supported. The use of CMIS services for the uploading of files from the NEF to the OSF is specified in the GSM 12.00 [7].\n\nWhen the procedure defined in GSM 12.00 [7] and GSM 12.01 [8] are used to transfer the trace records, the file type shall be traceRecords and the format of the file is given by the type TraceFileFormat.\n\n9.2.2\tLog control\n\nThis function permits the trace record to be stored and retrieved from logs within the NEF. The logging of these records is performed in accordance with the log control function specified in CCITT X.735 [15] and no additional management functions are required.\n\n9.2.3\tLog access\n\nThis TMN function controls the access to the log described above. Each log defined may contain one or more log entries. Each log entry contains a single trace record.\n\nFor further details concerning the use of logs, see CCITT X.735 [15].\n\nThe following system management functions are required:\n\n9.2.4\tEvent Reporting\n\n9.2.4.1\tEvent Forwarding Discriminators\n\nFor shortterm recording of tracing events and for more complicated filter conditions the event forwarding discriminator construct defined in CCITT X.734 [14] and CCITT X.721 [13] can be employed. The event forwarding discriminator construct is extremely flexible permitting the combination of a number of fields and logical operations with a wide variety of scheduling options. The EFD also controls the destinations to which the event reports are sent. Several such filters may be defined and scheduled for operation at different times and for different time periods.\n\nThe following system management functions are required:\n\n9.2.4.2\tDirect Transfer by Trace Control Function\n\nThis function permits the NEF to transmit trace records direct to the OSF. In general the trace record shall be sent on completion of the call or the traceable event. This function is controlled by means of the \"priority\" indicator, which is contained in the trace type. If the priority indicator is not set, then the trace records shall be stored on file within the NE filestore. These records may be subsequently collected via bulk record transfer as described in subclause 9.2.1. If the trace type specified on activation includes the \"priority\" indicator then all of the records shall be sent via trace reports to the OSF specified by the operation system id.\n\nThe following system management functions are required:",

In order to support these charging mechanisms, the network performs real-time monitoring of resource usage on the above three levels in order to detect the relevant chargeable events. The charging levels are further described in clause 5.3.\n\nIn offline charging, the resource usage is reported from the network to the BD after the resource usage has occurred. In online charging, a subscriber account, located in an OCS or CCS, is queried prior to granting permission to use the requested network resource(s).\n\nTypical examples of network resource usage are a voice call of certain duration, the transport of a certain volume of data, or the submission of a MM of a certain size. The network resource usage requests may be initiated by the UE (MO case) or by the network (MT case).\n\nOffline and online charging may be performed simultaneously and independently for the same chargeable event. Clause 5.5 provides further insight into potential utilisation of the charging information produced by the offline and online charging mechanisms.\n\n4.1.1\tOffline charging\n\nOffline charging is a process where charging information for network resource usage is collected concurrently with that resource usage. The charging information is then passed through a chain of logical charging functions that are further explained in clause 4.3.1 and clause 4.3.3. At the end of this process, CDR files are generated by the network, which are then transferred to the network operator's BD for the purpose of subscriber billing and/or inter-operator accounting (or additional functions, e.g. statistics, at the operator's discretion). The BD typically comprises post-processing systems such as the operator's billing system or billing mediation device.\n\nIn conclusion, offline charging is a mechanism where charging information does not affect, in real-time, the service rendered.\n\n4.1.2\tOnline charging\n\nOnline charging is a process where charging information for network resource usage is collected concurrently with that resource usage in the same fashion as in offline charging. However, authorization for the network resource usage must be obtained by the network prior to the actual resource usage to occur. This authorization is granted by the OCS or CCS upon request from the network.\n\nWhen receiving a network resource usage request, the network assembles the relevant charging information and generates a charging event towards the OCS or CCS in real-time. The OCS or CCS then returns an appropriate resource usage authorization. The resource usage authorization may be limited in its scope (e.g. volume of data or duration), therefore the authorization may have to be renewed from time to time as long as the user's network resource usage persists.\n\nNote that the charging information utilized in online charging is not necessarily identical to the charging information employed in offline charging.\n\nIn conclusion, online charging is a mechanism where charging information can affect, in real-time, the service rendered and therefore a direct interaction of the charging mechanism with the control of network resource usage is required.\n\n4.1.3\tConverged charging\n\nConverged charging is a process where online and offline charging are combined. The charging information is utilized by CCS in one converged charging service which offers charging with and without quota management, as well as charging information record generation.",

    "context": "https://www.sharetechnote.com/html/Handbook_LTE_LTEU_LTER.html\n\nLTE Adv: LAA/LTE-U\n\nRecently (from 2014 as far as I remember), there has been pretty much discussion (even real testing going on) on LTE being extended to non-standard mode of operation (Non 3GPP yet at least up to this point, as of Jan 2015).\n\nNote : In early second half of 2016, I saw a company to try LTE-U device for the first timie, and as it approaches to the end of the year, I saw many companies testing LTE-U devices. Now in early 2017 we are at the stage of testing LAA.\n\nTwo of the technology falling into this category is LTE-U and LTE-R. LTE-U has been proposed and start being implemented in the industry for about a year and LTE-R just start being proposed as Integrated wireless railway network to be commercialized .\n\nAs of Jun 2016, I don't see/hear anything about LTE-R.. but I saw the drastic evolution of unlicensed LTE that created several different technologies (names) to the list. It started with LTE-U and evolved to LAA, eLAA and recently we are hearing of new branches like MulteFire and LWA. I don't know how many other technologies are waiting to be newly evolved and which of these technologies\nwill survive to the end.. some of them are now pretty well defined but there are a lot of other features to be defined technically. I will keep following them up and try to write down whatever has been clarified.\n\nFollowings are the brief descriptions for each of these technologies. I will put further details under separate section if more technical details are published. Also, I put many whitepapers and YouTube links under Reference section. I would recommend you to go through those materials when you have free time and use this page as reminder afterwards. (The contents of this table\nis mostly based on Ref [7] )\n\nFollowings are the list of topics that gives you further details of various LTE-Unlicensed technologies.\n\nIn every wireless communication, the communicating parties (transmitter and reciever) need to allocatie a certain amount of resources in both time domain and frequency domain. However, we don't have much control over frequency domain resource allocation because those resources are fixed permanently or semi-statically. So it is usually not in the scope of scheduling. When it comes to scheduling, Time Domain resource allocation tend to be more important.\n\nIn 3GPP based technology (i.e, Cellular Communication Technology like LTE), the time domain scheduling is obvious and determinstic even when there are many devices are in communication because all of the time domain resources determined by the central master (Base Station /Node B/eNode B). However, in 802.11 based technology(i.e LAN, Wireless LAN etc) there is no central controling master in terms of scheduling. In this case, there is always possibility that transmission signal from one device interfere with communication of other devices. To prevent (or at least reduce) this situation, we need a special algorithm for Time Domain Scheduling. Time Domain Scheduling in this case mean 'Determine when to transmit and how long it transmit'.\n\nThen why we need to care of this kind of thing in LTE-Unlicensed technology ? Basically LTE Unlicensed technology (e.g, LTE-U, LAA etc) refer to a technology in which LTE operates in 802.11 frequency region. So LTE need to keep the rule set by 802.11 in order not to prevent the communiction between existing 802.11 devices.\n\nThere are many variations of the time domain scheduling, but the basic idea and logic is same. Basic idea is 'Your transmission should not interfere with communication between others' and the basic logic is 'Before you transmit anything, check if the chennel(medium) is already being used by others'. This logic can be illustrated as follows.\n\nThen you may have some questions as follows : How to check (i.e, how to figure out) whether the channel (medium) is being used by other ? and how long the device need to check before it make any decision ?\n\nIn the effort to answer these questions, you will come across many terms that may confuse you for so long. I tried to list up those confusing words and how these are related to each other in following illustration. If you are new to this area, I would suggest you to understand 'what is CS and ED ?' first and then try to understand how CS / ED is used in higher level technology like CSMA/CD, CSMA/CA, CCS, LBT, CSAT etc. Already feel headache ? :)\n\nCS / ED : CS stands for Carrier Sensing and ED stands for Energy Detection. The fundamental concept is same. The term CS is more frequently used in 802.11 area especially for Wired LAN Area. In this technology, the device measures the energy level in the channel (medium) mostly in the form of voltage and compares the measured voltage with a specified value (threshold value). ED stands for Energy Detection. it is more frequently used in wireless/cellular technology. In this method, the device measures the energy level in the channel (medium) mostly in the form of Power and compares the measured power with a specified value (threshold value)\n\nCSMA/CD or CSMA/CA : As the term CSMA(Carrier Sensing Multiple Access) implies, these are technology of figuring out whether a channel is available or not based on CS method. You don't need to know the details of thechnology under the context of LTE-Unlicensed technology, but if you are really interested in thses method refer to CSMA/CD and CSMA/CA page.\n\nCCA : CCA stands for Clear Channel Assessment. As the word implies, this is a method to figure out the channel is clear (i.e, nobody is using the channel). CCA perform ED(Energy Detection) for a certain period of time and make a decision whether the channel is clear or not. It is a common method being used in 802.11 (WLAN) technology.\n\nHow long CCA perform ED before it make decision ? It depends on higher layer technology (e.g, 802.11 FHSS, 802.11 OFDM, LBT). However, the minimum time span is 18 us sec.\n\nWhat is the threshold energy level to make decision whether the channel is being used by some other device or not ? This also varies depending on power class of the device and reciever antenna gain. However, the base threshold is -70 dBm.\n\nNOTE : Refer to 802.11 specification and ETSI EN 300 328 if you want to get full details and requirement for CCA.\n\nLBT: LBT stands for Listen Before Talk. According to ETSI EN 300 328, LBT is defined as 'mechanism by which an equipment applies clear channel assessment (CCA) before using the channel' (In this document, you can find a couple of variations of LBT depending on different situations). As you see in the terminology itself, 'Listen Before Talk' indicate two major process, the first one is 'Listen' and the second part is 'Talk'. The meaning of 'Talk' is obvious. It means 'Transmit Data'. The tricky part is 'what does it exactly mean by 'Listen''. In more technical definition, 'Listen' mean 'perform CCA(Clear Channel Assessment)'. You can find a more detailed description on LBT in IEEE P802.19-08/0034r0 (The specific value (i.e, transmission time, threshold value may vary depending on application, but I think this explains overal LBT mechanism in easier way than other documents).\n\nCSAT : CSAT stands for Carrier Sensing Adaptive Transmission. CSAT is very similar to CSMA or LBT(Listen Before Talk), the main difference is that CSAT monitors(senses) the medium for much longer duration (around tens of msec to 200 msec) comparing to normal WiFi CSMA, so that it would not interfere not only with WiFi\ndata transmission (QoS traffic) but also with more sporadic transmission like discovery signals (Ref [2]). Unlike other techiques described in this section (defined with focus on 802.11 technology), CSAT is defined by LTE-U Forum with focus on 3GPP technology.\n\nIn LTE, every transmission within a specified spectrum is well managed/scheduled both for downlink and uplink. So Network can figure out exactly when to transmit something and when UE will transmit something.. but in Unlicensed band transmission and reception by the existing WiFi device is not as predictable as in LTE. Basically anybody can transmit in anytime as long as it complies with\nCSMA/CA procedure.\n\nIn this kind of situation, how LTE network can schedule transmission in Unlicensed band ?\n\nOne method is for LTE cell to perform a special channel selection procedure and allocate the channel only when it is clean. \nIn channel selection process, network measures the energy level within the allowed band and use those area in which the energy level is under a certain threshold (e.g, -62 dBm over 20 Mhz BW).\n\nThe Cell performs this kind of channel selection algorithm in on-going mode and if needed it will select more suitable channel and switch to it.\n\nWhat if you (a Cell) fail to find any clean channel at the initial channel selection process ?\n\nIn this case, the cell use another mechanism called CSAT (Carrier-Sensing Adaptive Transmission). Technically, CSAT is very similar to CSMA or LBT(Listen Before Talk), the main difference is that CSAT monitors(senses) the medium for much longer duration (around tens of msec to 200 msec) comparing to normal WiFi CSMA, so that it would not interfere not only with WiFi\ndata transmission (QoS traffic) but also with more sporadic transmission like discovery signals (Ref [2]).\n\nAccording to Reference [5], there seems to be roughly three levels of Coexistence strategy regarding LTE-U. Most of these techniques are already mentioned in previous section, but let me rewrite in a little bit different words.\n\nChannel Selection : This says \"Use WiFi band only when it is not being used (i.e, the band is clean)\". To figure out whether it is being used or not, you have to measure the engergy level of the target band as described above.\n\nTime-domain coexistence techniques : Even when it fail to find any clean channel in channel selection stage, there is still some chance. Even though there is no clean channel at the point of channel selection, there might be some empty slots if you look at the time domain scheduling with relatively high granularity.\nTo find out this kind of time domain opportunity and in order not to make an interference at any time, they are considering several different technology like CSAT, eCSAT, LBT. My personal question were 'do we have to support all these technology everywhere (every devices)?'. This question was answered by Reference [5] as follows.\n\nFor non listen-before-talk (LBT) markets such as the US, South Korea, China and India, CSAT (Carrier Sensing Adaptive Transmission) can be used without changing Rel-10 Carrier Aggregation protocols for co-channel coexistence. For LBT markets such as Europe and Japan, Rel-13 LAA will enable channel sharing with Wi-Fi by performing clear channel assessment (CCA) based channel availability sensing and adapting the transmission duration on a fine timescale, ranging from 1ms-10ms\n\nOpportunistic SCell operation : To me, this sounds like a rule (not a technology). Basically this says \"Use the unlicensed band only when it is really necessary (e.g, in real demand on high throughput or when the primary cell is overloaded). Release the unlicensenced and fall back to anchor carrier when\nthe demand for unlicenced band is not critical.\n\nInterplay of these coexistance technical components are well illustrated as follows in Ref [2].\n\nLTE-U stands for LTE-Unlicensed. This is the first real implementation of the whole LTE-Unlicensed family as far as I remember. Since this is already implemented and tested relatively widely and a lot of details are known, I thought I got enough information to write this subject in a separate page. Refer to LTE-U page for the details.\n\nIn other LTE-Unlincensed technology, LTE borrow only radio spectrum from WLAN and all the transmission/reception technology except radio spectrum purely based on LTE. However, in LWA LTE borrows not only WLAN radio spectrum but also WLAN Access Point for transmitting data. This key difference is illustrated as below. To implement this key difference, we would need to implement many other\ntechnical components. The most important part would be to implmenet special interface between LTE eNB and WLAN AP. Then you may ask.. at which layer the eNB and WLAN will be connected ? It would be quicker to interact if they can get connected at lower layer (e.g, PHY/MAC), but LTE PHY/MAC and WLAN PHY/MAC is completely different.. so hard to make any connection at this layer. So they will use higher layer (specifically PDCP) for this connection. As you know, there is no PDCP layer in WLAN. So connecting at PDCP\nlayer might be a little bit misleading. More accruately speaking, LTE PDCP packet will be encapsulated into WLAN MAC frame.\n\nNow LWA is defined in 3GPP specification and I created a separate page for 3GPP LWA because it will be a long story. Refer to LWA page for the 3GPP details.\n\nAround the end of 2016, I start hearing of implementing this both on UE modem and Network, UE testing equipment side. Now (as of early 2017) I am hearing of testing this feature on real UE. So I decided to create separate page for this. Read LAA page for the details.\n\nPutting very simple way, Multipath Aggregation (more formally Multipath TCP Aggregation : mptcp) is LTE-WLAN aggregation at TCP level as illustrated below. The key component in this architecture would be MP Proxy (Multipath Proxy) and this part is being defined in IETF (Ref [12] )\n\nAs of now (Jan 2015), I don't have any specific information other than Integrated wireless railway network to be commercialized .\n\n[1] LTE-U/LAA, MuLTEfire and Wi-Fi; making best use of unlicensed spectrum (Qualcomm)\n\n[9] Cracking Google Project Fi & LTE/Wi-Fi Aggregation with Qualcomm - Wi-Fi Now Episode 5 (YouTube)\n\n[10] The LTE-U vs. Wi-Fi debate continues empowering carriers with seamless Wi-Fi - Wi-Fi Now Episode 15 (YouYube)\n\n[15] ETSI EN 300 328 Wideband transmission systems;Data transmission equipment operating in the 2,4 GHz ISM band and using wide band modulation techniques;",

Tech.: Linearity\n\nOne of the most important assumption for most of communication theory is that the system is LTI (Linear Time Invarient). So it is very important to understand the concept of LTI before you start getting deeper into communication technology. In this page, I will explain about what 'Linear' (Linearity) means and why it is important and in another page I will explain about 'Time Invarience'.\n\nWhat does Linearity means ? you may think any function that can be expressed as a straight line in a coordinate system is linear. But it is not true. Not all straight line in the coordinate system is linear. For a function (system) to be a linear, it has to meet a criteria called 'principle of superposision'.\n\nLet's assum that you have a function f(x) as a straight line starting starting from the origin (0,0) of the coordinate system.\n\nNow look at the upper graph on left side first. If you plug a value 'a' (in thick blue line)' into the function. yoe will get the output of the function as f(a) (in thick red line).\n\nNow look at the bottom graph on left side first. If you plug a value 'b' (in thick green line)' into the function. yoe will get the output of the function as f(b) (in thick black line).\n\nNow let's take the graph of f(a+b). It is the graph on the right side. Just by looking, you would notice that f(a+b) is same as f(a) + f(b). Therefore, this graph(function, system) is linear.\n\nIs this a linear function ? Let's see if this meets the principle of superposition, i.e, f(a+b) = f(a) + f(b). Let's assume a = 3, b = 2.\n\nDoes this satisfy the principle of superposition ? (In strict mathematics, you cannot prove it with just single. You have to prove this is true for any numbers... try all different values as 'a' and 'b' and check if it still works -:). But intuitively, you can say \"Yes, it satisfy the principle of superposition, so this function is a linear'.\n\nIf the explanation above is not clear to you, it would be clearer if you look at an example in which f(a+b) is not the same as f(a)+f(b). Following is an example.\n\nLook at the function graph in this case. It is not the straight line, it is a path kinked at one point (or you can draw a curved line as the function).\n\nNow look at the upper graph on left side first. If you plug a value 'a' (in thick blue line)' into the function. you will get the output of the function as f(a) (in thick red line).\n\nNow look at the bottom graph on left side first. If you plug a value 'b' (in thick green line)' into the function. yoe will get the output of the function as f(b) (in thick black line).\n\nNow let's take the graph of f(a+b). It is the graph on the right side. Just by looking, you would notice that f(a+b) is not same as f(a) + f(b). Therefore, this graph(function, system) is not linear.\n\nIs this a linear function ? Let's see if this meets the principle of superposition, i.e, f(a+b) = f(a) + f(b). Let's assume a = 3, b = 2.\n\nIs f(a+b) = f(a) + f(b) ? No, it is because f(3+2) is 25 but f(3) + f(2) = 9 + 4 = 13.\n\nI hope you have the general concept of linearity by now. But I think practically more important question would be \"Why the Linearity is so important ?\", \"Why we have to care about linearity ?\".\n\nIt is important because in linear system, once you have an output for any specific input, you can figure out all other outputs without doing real test.\n\nFor example, let's assume that you have a linear system and you know the outout of the system when you put '1' as an input is '2', i.e f(1) = 2 and somebody ask you to get the output when the input is 5, meaning that he wants to get 'f(5)'. In this case, by the principle of superposition you can rewrite the f(5) as follows.\n\nSince you already know the value of f(1) = 2, you can get f(5) as follows without doing any test.\n\nYou would see later that we usually indentify the characteristics of any linear system by what we call 'impulse response'. Once you have the impulse response of the system, you can figure out the output of the system for any input by using the impulse response. This is possible only when the system is Linear.",

LTE radio network dimensioning is typically optimized for data services. To avoid negative impacts on user experience for VoLTE subscribers in areas with weak LTE coverage, a handover to 2G or 3G is performed sooner, i.e. at a higher RSRP level, for UEs with established voice bearers compared to UEs with only data bearers.\n\nAs in the Technical Specification for Multimedia Telephony Service over IMS (MTSI), TS 26.114, which is used as basis for the GSMA IR.92 VoLTE profile, there have been several tools for increased robustness of speech calls with initial selection of Codecs and their Configuration and in-call dynamic rate and mode adaptation and application layer redundancy. EVS (Enhanced Voice Services), especially the EVS Channel Aware mode, demonstrates higher robustness against transmission errors than AMR and AMR-WB codecs.\n\nBased on the above provided background and depending on network dimensioning, which typically targets at data services, the VoLTE coverage may be a function of the selected codec and its configuration, its rate adaptation, and potentially the applied application layer redundancy, as well as the required QoS of the VoLTE bearer. It is adopted that a new QoS parameter Maximum Packet Loss Rate in UL and DL directions is defined and sent from PCRF to eNB. At reception of the IMS service information from the P-CSCF, if configured through policy, the PCRF determines the Maximum Packet Loss Rate for UL and DL based on the IMS service information e.g. codec and sends it to PCEF along with the PCC rule for the voice media. This parameter is transferred to the eNB to support it for handover threshold decision.\n\nBased on the analysis/evaluation of this eVoLP WID, the existing 3GPP 4G specifications TS 23.401, 23.203 and 5G specifications TS 23.501, 23.502, 23.503 have been modified according to it.\n\nReferences",

This equates to \"activation of a trace\" in TS 29.002 [6].\n\nactive pending: The state of an activated trace is called Active Pending in a particular NE when the subscriber or equipment being traced is not registered in that NE.\n\ninvocation of a trace: An event relating to a particular IMSI or IMEI that occurs in the network that causes data to be collected in a trace record in circumstances where trace has been activated for that IMSI or IMEI. This equates to \"tracing subscriber activity\" in TS 29.002 [6] and \"Trace Invocation\" in TS 48.008 [4]. It is possible that an event relating to the IMSI/IMEI may still be active when another event or events relating to the same IMSI/IMEI occurs which requires additional information to be collected. These additional events are termed parallel events. This additional trace information for parallel events is collected in the same trace record as the first event.\n\ntrace record: In the NEF a trace record is a set of traceable data collected as determined by the trace type.

In contrast to LTE, OFDM can also be used in the NR uplink (UL) direction. As a complement waveform with lower peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) to improve UL coverage, DFT-s-OFDM (OFDM with Discrete Fourier Transform precoding) can be used in the uplink although limited to single-layer transmission only.\n\nTo cope with various deployment scenarios, NR supports a wide range of carrier frequencies (within two possible ranges) and channel bandwidths, as shown in the table below.\n\nTo allow for such a flexibility, NR uses a flexible frame structure, with different Subcarrier Spacings (SCS). The SCS is the distance between the centres of two consecutive subcarriers, and the possible values for SCS are (in kHz): 15; 30; 60; 120 and 240. This is referred to as \"multiple numerologies\".\n\nA consecutive series of 12 subcarriers forms one Resource Block (RB). An NR channel bandwidth consists of a number of RBs. A Resource Element (RE) is defined as a unit of one subcarrier (frequency domain) and one OFDM symbol (time domain).\n\nAs for the time domain, it is divided in 10ms radio frames, each on consisting in 10 subframes of 1ms each, as shown in the picture below.\n\nIn turn, each subframe consists of 1/2/4/8/16 slots -shown in different colors- depending on the selected SCS/numerology.  The figure shows the cases of SCS values of 15; 30; 60 and 120 KHz, while the table below provides the full list of possible numerologies in NR. As shown in the figure for the 15 kHz case, each slot consists of 14 OFDM symbols (independently of the SCS) preceded by a cyclic prefix (CP).\n\nNote that, for the 60 kHz SCS, an extended CP is possible. The extended CP is approximately four times longer than the normal CP and is used for cells having large delay spread. In this case, one slot consists of only 12 OFDM symbols.\n\nThe OFDM symbol duration and CP length are inversely proportional of the SCS. E.g. for 15 kHz SCS, the OFDM symbol duration is approximately 66.6 µs and the CP length is approximately 4.7 µs. When the SCS is doubled, i.e. 30 kHz, the OFDM and CP lengths are approximately devided by two compared to the 15kHz SCS.\n\nNR supports both FDD and TDD operation with the same frame structure. In the case of TDD, and as to allow for flexible traffic adaptation, each OFDM symbol in a slot can be classified as 'downlink', 'uplink' or 'flexible' (i.e. either downlink or uplink). This can be configured semi-statically or it can change dynamically as part of the scheduling decision.\n\nTransmissions are usually carried out over one slot. In specific cases, transmissions can be carried out over only a fraction of a slot, with the minimum set to only two symbols. Such very short transmissions mainly target usage cases requiring low latency, such as some URLLC (Ultra Reliable, Low Latency) services.",

It is mainly for 5G Radio System. Even though no 3GPP specification about 5G is available, this project will contribute a lot in 5G community. Refer to OpenAirInterface home page for the details.\n\nOpenAirInterface (OAI) Software Alliance aims to further the software towards future 3GPP releases for 5G. The main goal of the alliance is to create an ecosystem of industrial/non-profit/academic organizations to implement reference solution for 3GPP standards. The OAI is striving to become a tool used by both the industry and academic for using community driven development to accelerate innovation in 5G wireless technologies, and to bring the huge economic success to this part of information technology. The OAI targets a reference implementation of Release 14 LTE based on the current 4G implementation and to progressively add enhancements from 3GPP study items defining the future 5G standard.\n\nOpenAirInterface is an open source implementation of 3GPP stack. It covers different parts of 3GPP stack (eNodeB, UE, MME, HSS, S-GW, P-GW). The software runs on general purpose computing platform (for ex. Intel/ARM) and interfaces with wide variety of SDR platforms (EXMIMO, USRP, BladeRF, LimeSDR).\n\nThe OAI currently implements Rel 8/10 stack for eNB/UE/EPC. It runs on standard Ubuntu Linux 14.04 LTS with low-latency kernel for eNB/UE. OAI requires Intel processors which support (SSE3/SSE4), however support for AVX2 is optional. It is also a requirement to have USB3/PCIe on a PC which interfaces with SDR platforms (USRP, BladeRF, EXMIMO and LimeSDR). The code compiles with standard GNU toolchain that comes with Linux. OAI can be also run in simulation mode (oaisim), the details of which are provided by Open Air Usage tutorials on the gitlab server@EURECOM.\n\nThe OAI software packages used to deploy an operators core network, the Enhanced Packet Core or EPC, are collectively known as openairCN while the access network software for base stations and terminals goes under the name of openair5G.\n\nThe EPC is quickly being integrated with other open source software packages providing telecommunication services and solutions for network management (e.g. openIMS, Clearwater IMS, OpenDayLight, Open Source MANO (OSM), OpNFV) on the generic cloud computing platform OpenStack. To ease integration with OpenStack software packages, and because revenues from the EPC are less dependent on intellectual property agreements, openairCN is distributed with a standard Apache V2.0 license, which is quite common in cloud computing software. The access network software openair5G, on the other hand, is freely distributed by the OAI under the terms stipulated by a new open source licence, the OAI Public License, catering to the intellectual property agreements used in 3GPP and allowing contributions from 3GPP members holding patents on key procedures used in the standard. The OAI is working closely with ETSI to harmonise the software licence with the intellectual property policy of 3GPP. The end result is that groups can use the software as any Apache V2.0 software for non-commercial purposes (e.g. for study and research) while for commercial exploitation of the community software, users are bound to respect intellectual property agreements associated with the 3GPP standard as with proprietary hardware and software. For details on OAI licensing model, please refer to OAI License Model page.\n\nSince, the evolution of 5G is still under discussion within academia/industry, we plan to identify different areas in which different members of the alliance create projects. The projects are created with the goal of furthering these strategic areas within the alliance and making sure the output of the project is merged back with the main repository at some point. The strategic areas of the alliance ratified by the board are listed here.\n\nIn order to install OAI successfully, it is important to follow HW/SW requirements. Almost all the technical documentation is hosted on EURECOM gitlab server. The entry point for wiki for openair5G is OAI Wiki/Home and the entry point for openairCN is OAI-CN Wiki/Home is here. There are several tutorials inside Gitlab page to run OAI in various modes (Emulation, Simulation, real-time with COTS UE, etc). The mailing lists for both user and developer community is OAI Wiki/Mailinglist. The gitlab workflow/coding guidelines/contributing guidelines are here.\n\nOAI hosts several training/workshops periodically for roadmap discussions with the community and also to train the community regarding the software implementation. For more information, refer to OAI Community/Workshop.\n\nThe Alliance offers several membership models for companies, non-profit institutions and individual contributors. The membership is free for individuals/non-profit organizations, however there is fee for corporations. For more info regarding membership, refer to OSA/JoinUs.\n\nQ2. Is there any operating system requirement ? (What type of linux ? what version ? etc) What is Operating System details that has been verified by OAI developers.\n\nQ4. What kind of hardware can be used to run OAI and what are those which has been verified by OAI developer ?\n\nQ4-1. Would OAI be runnable on USRP Embedded Sieries ? (Any verification activity done ?)\n\n[Ans] Yes, but we have not tried it. OAI needs to be ported to ZynQ to run on USRP Embedded series.\n\nQ4-2.There are many different series of USRP. Is there any specific series/model that is not usable for OAI ? (In terms of performance etc)\n\n[Ans] It is not recommended to use USRP N series as it is not able to do LTE sampling rate (30.72 for 20 MHz). In order to use USRP N-series, LTE sampling rate needs to be implemented in software on a PC\n\nQ5. Is there any additional libraries or tools that are required to OAI stack ? (e.g, GNU Radio or FFTW etc)\n\n[Ans] There are additional libraries required but they are installed automatically by OAI scripts (Refer to OAI Autobuild for details).\n\nQ7. Is it possible to develop use OAI as software simulator without hardware ? (Like Matlab LTE toolbox)\n\n[Ans] Yes, it has a simulation mode called oaisim (Refer to OIA Wiki/OpenAirUsage for details).\n\n[Ans] 5 Mhz and 10 Mhz has been most extensively tested as of now (Apr 2016) and 20 MHz is close to being released as well, but theoretically it should work with all bands\n\nQ10. What is the maximum MCS and maximum RB that has been proved working (for 5Mhz, 10 Mhz BW) in OAI system ?",

It may use either the control- or user-plane protocols as underlying transport. In this specification, only control plane use of LPP is defined. User plane support of LPP is defined in [15] and [16].\n\nLPP messages are carried as transparent PDUs across intermediate network interfaces using the appropriate protocols (e.g., NGAP over the NG-C interface, NAS/RRC over the LTE-Uu and NR-Uu interfaces). The LPP protocol is intended to enable positioning for NR and LTE using a multiplicity of different position methods, while isolating the details of any particular positioning method and the specifics of the underlying transport from one another.\n\nThe protocol operates on a transaction basis between a target device and a server, with each transaction taking place as an independent procedure. More than one such procedure may be in progress at any given moment. An LPP procedure may involve a request/response pairing of messages or one or more \"unsolicited\" messages. Each procedure has a single objective (e.g., transfer of assistance data, exchange of LPP related capabilities, or positioning of a target device according to some QoS and use of one or more positioning methods). Multiple procedures, in series and/or in parallel, can be used to achieve more complex objectives (e.g., positioning of a target device in association with transfer of assistance data and exchange of LPP related capabilities). Multiple procedures also enable more than one positioning attempt to be ongoing at the same time (e.g., to obtain a coarse location estimate with low delay while a more accurate location estimate is being obtained with higher delay).\n\nAn LPP session is defined between a positioning server and the target device, the details of its relation with transactions are described in clause 4.1.2 of TS 36.355 [19].\n\nFor the 3GPP 5GS Control Plane solution defined in TS 23.501 [2] and TS 23.502 [26], the UE is the target device and the LMF is the server. For SUPL 2.0 support, the SUPL Enabled Terminal (SET) is the target device and the SUPL Location Platform (SLP) is the server. The operations controlled through LPP are described further in clause 7.1.\n\n6.2.2\tRadio Resource Control (RRC) for NR\n\nThe RRC protocol for NR is terminated between the gNB and the UE. It provides transport for LPP messages over the NR-Uu interface.\n\n6.2.3\tRadio Resource Control (RRC) for LTE\n\nThe RRC protocol for LTE is terminated between the ng-eNB and the UE. In addition to providing transport for LPP messages over the LTE-Uu interface, it supports transfer of measurements that may be used for positioning purposes through the existing measurement systems specified in TS 36.331 [13].",

Tech.: Coding\n\nIn this page, I will go through Matlab/Octave functions for communication system within a context of a whole process but in step-by-step manner. You would have seen many other resources elsewhere explaining on these functions, but most of the material that I have seen was purely for showing the syntax of each functions. So it was very hard for me to understand practical meaning of those functions\nwithin a whole communication process.\n\n(With Reference to Lec 2 | MIT 6.450 Principles of Digital Communications I, Fall 2006 (YouTube) )\n\nIt is because \"We want to implement Efficient process\". What do you mean by \"Effiecient process\" ? It may roughly mean \"a process to send data using as less number of bits as possible\" and \"a process to be guaranteed to work\". All that the thick text book is trying to say is \"How we can make the efficient process ?\", \"How do you represent it in mathemaical form ?\", \"How do you prove (in mathemtical way) that it is efficient and always work?\"\n\nIn real work, most of engineers doesn't care about this. There are only handsful of persons who digest all those textbook issues and come out with 'what they think is efficient process' and produce 'technical specification (e.g, 3GPP)'. Around 99% of us just follows the specification. That's why we don't read the text book after we graduate from university and still can survive -:)\n\nThere would be a couple of variations of the definitions of Source Coding depending on the context. The first type of definition is 'to convert the original data(user data) into a certain binary sequence' which is illustrated as below.\n\n(With Reference to Lec 2 | MIT 6.450 Principles of Digital Communications I, Fall 2006 (YouTube) )\n\nAnother type of definition for source coding (according to Ref [2]) is to convert a source data into a form that can minimize the bandwidth that are required to transmit the data. Simply put, it is just another name for 'Data Compression'.\n\nAgain, It doesn't look that complicated. Then why the text book about this is so thick ?\n\nChannel Coding is a method to replace 'original data bits' with 'some other bits (normally longer than the original bits)'. For example, the simplest coding would be as follows :\n\nAnother example of coding would be addition of parity bits as in RS 232 communication\n\nIn communication system, we usually call 'the original data' as a 'message' and call the ecoded data as 'Codeword'. In all encoding process, the length of Codeword is greater than the length of 'message', in means that in coding process some additional bits are added to the original data(message) and this additional bits are called 'redundency bits'.\n\nMost of the experts in this area would come out with something like 'Shannon's theorem'.. but let's just look at this in intuitive way rather than bringing up such a scary words.\n\nLet's look at the simple wireless communication process that we went through in previous section. In this process, what do you think is the biggest problem ?\n\nThe answer is the 'noise' which is added by 'Channel'. As you can guess, this noise would make a lot of errors while the reciever is demodulate the received signal into the bit stream.\n\nWhich option do you prefer ? You would know that the first option would be almost impossible especially in wireless communication. If it is wired communication, at least you can make some try to reduce the noise in the channel but in wireless it is almost impossible to remove the noise directly from the channel.\n\nIt means the only option is to develop some method (algorithm) to detect and correct the error caused by the noisy channel. This is the main motivation for 'Coding'.\n\nMain idea of Coding is to add some additional bits (we call this as redundancy bits) to original data in a very special way (not in a random/arbitrary way) so that they can be used to detect the exact location of error and correct it.\n\nIn communication chain, following two blocks are added for this purpose. 'Encoding' is the process of adding redundancy bits and 'Decoding' is the process of extracting the error corrected bits from the received data.\n\nUsually Encoding/Decoding blocks locate as shown below. Encoding takes in the bits stream and produce coded bit stream.\n\nGetting in further detail, this encoding often happens in two steps called Source Coding and Channel Coding, but in this post I will just describe this process as a single step.\n\nIn previous section, I said \"Encoding/Decoding is mainly for detecting/correcting erros generated in communication process\". It is very good and important step. But once you gain something, you would lose some other things. It is almost nature of everything including our life.\n\nWhat is the gain for Encoding/Decoding ? It is the received data with less or almost no error.\n\nWhat is the loss ? What is downside of this process ? Following are the major issues caused by Encoding/Decoding process.\n\nAs I said earlier, Coding is adding some redundancy bits to original data and these redundancy bits will be used to detect and correct error in decoding process. There are many different Encoding/Decoding algorithms which has it's own advantage and disadvantages. So we would always have the following question when we implement Coding/Decoding Blocks.\n\nIn general, the more redundancy bits you add, you would have higher error detection/correction capability. But the more redudancy bit you add, the less throughput you would get because larger portions of transmitted bits should be allocated for the redundancy bits, not for the information that you want to send. So you have to carefully determine how many bits you would allocate for the redundancy\nbits.\n\nFortunately in most mobile communication system, somebody else has already determined the answer to these questions. For example, in LTE or WCDMA system.. 3GPP specification specifies all the details of Encoding/Decoding process and you don't have to worry about these questions.\n\nFor example, in LTE case, 3GPP 36.212 specifies the Coding algorithm and related parameters as shown below. Chapter 5 of the specification provides all the detailed parameters to implement the coding process.\n\nFrom now, I will introduce some of the basic functions in Matlab/Octave related to Encoding/Decoding. My goal is to extend this section to Turbo Coding/Convolution Coding which is most widely used in mobile communication system, but I am not sure by when I can achieve this goal. Let's just start with the simple things first.\n\nBlock Code is an encoding method in which we split the whole input data stream into small blocks and replace the small block (Message) with another small block(Codeword).\n\nThis process can be illustrated as shown below. The small block getting into the Encoding function is called a 'message' and the block getting out of the Encoding function is called 'Codeword'. We also express this process in a symbol (n,k). n is the number of bits for codeword(output) and k is the number of bits for message (input). n is always greater than k, meaning the length of output\n(Codeword) is always longer than the length of input(Message).\n\nOne example of block code is as shown below. In this example, we split the input data stream into 4 bit chunks and replace each of the chunks with 7 bit chunk. The mapping table between each possible 4 bit chunk(input = message) and 7 bit chunk(output = codeword) is shown below.\n\n'Linear' when you say 'Linear Coding' means a set of code in which any linear combination (modular 2 sum) of two codes within the set results in a code which also belong to the original set. Let's assume that you have a set of codes as follows. Take out any two codes from the set and take modular 2 sum of them. The result is also a member of the set as shown below. Take any other two\ncodes and try yourself.\n\n'Cyclic' is a set of code in which a code can be generated by cyclic shift of another code in the set. or in other word, any number of cyclic shift of a code in the set also fall within the set. For example, let's assume that we have a code set which is made up of following four codes. If you look into each of these codes, you would notice that any of these codes can be created by the cyclic shift of another code as illustrated below.\n\nTake the code (0 1 0 1 0 1) and cyclic shift right by one and it gives (1 0 1 0 1 0) which is also a member of the set.\n\nTake the code (0 1 0 1 0 1) and cyclic shift right by two and it gives (0 1 0 1 0 1) which is also a member of the set.\n\nIn short, in this set .. whatever code you take and however many times you do cyclic shift, the result is always within the original set.\n\nReally, Is it true ? Can I use any arbitrary mapping table as pops up in my mind now ?\n\nYes, you can. but it doesn't mean that what you created in arbitrary way would be 'efficient' mapping (coding).\n\nThen what would be the efficient coding ? There may be multiple answers to this, but some common answer would be\n\nOne of the way to perform coding is to use what is called 'Generator Function'. You might come across this term in any kind of materials related to 'Coding'. My first response when I first heard of this function was 'What the hell, is it ?'. Is it something like those functions that we learned in high school ? It looks similar to what we learned in high school days.. e.g, g(x) = x^4 + x^2\n+ 1, but the way they are used looks pretty different from high school.\n\nI would not try to give you answer to these question here.. you will get it as you proceed. What I am trying to say is \"Don't feel yourself as stupid if you have the same questions\" -:).\n\nGenerator Function is a kind of 'Binary Function' which can perform 'coding' (Convering a message to a codeword) in following manner.\n\nExpressing the equation in more detailed form, it can be expressed as shown below.\n\nThe best way to understand the real meaning of the equation above would be by example. Here goes one example.\n\nyou can pack these equations into a matrix as shown below. (Note that the lowest order comes leftmost).\n\nNow, let's figure out codeword for this message (figure out the output bit stream when this message go through the encoder block). This is the point where we use the generator function shown above. The process to calculate the codeword using the generator function is as shown below.\n\nFor practice, try all the messages shown in overview section and check if your calculation matches the codewords in the section.\n\nNow let's take a high level view of generator function (generator matrix) and see if there is any recognizable pattern. It is as shown below.\n\ni) The number of rows is same as the length of message (number of bits in message)\n\nii) The matrix contains the k x k Identity matrix, where k is the length of the message\n\nNow you would ask another again. How can I get these generator functions ? (How can I know which generator functions I have to use ?). Don't worry.. in most case these functions/matrix will be given to you from the specification of the communication system. (Of course, there is theoretical background that justifies those generator functions given by the specification and you can refer to\nCommunication Text Books or surf on internet for it. I would not get further into it). In think, just understanding the meaning of the generator functions and how to use them to implement 'encoder' block would be enough in most case.\n\nNow let's look into the codebook we generated from higher level. As shown below, you would notice that the codebook contains the message part as it is at the end and redundant bits at the beginning. This is one of the characteristics of what we call 'linear block coding'.\n\nIt is hard to cleary explain what is the convolutional code is, but you would get a rough image if you think about the 'convolution' that you learned in your engineering math.\n\nRepresenting the convolutional coding process is not simple and clearly explained in short space. So I created a separate page for this(See ConvolutionalCode page).\n\n[1] Lec 2 | MIT 6.450 Principles of Digital Communications I, Fall 2006 (YouTube) )\n\n[2] SIMULATION OF DIGITAL COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS USING MATLAB By Mathuranathan Viswanathan",

Tech.: Fading\n\nIntuitive understanding of Fading would be simple, but the detailed description is pretty difficult and would be even more difficult to understand the details without going through the complicated mathematical process. This page would start with Intuitive description and try to keep adding the details one by one. It will take long time to complete the pages and will split this into multiple pages if it goes too long.\n\nIn most of the wireless communication environement, a signal out of a transmitter radiate into wide direction and these radiated signal takes different path and arriving at the reciever at different timing and with different signal strength(amplitude). As a result, the signal coming into the reciever is the composite of all the components. As you may learned in high school physics, when thetwo\ncopies of the signal get combined the resulting signal can be an augmented signal or attenuated signal depending on whether the two signal constructively combined or destructively combined.\n\nThen what determines whether the signals constructively combine or destructively combine ? The answer also come from high school physics. The phase of the two signal determines whether the signal constructively combine or destructively combine.\n\nIn wireless communication environment, many copies of the signals get combined at the reciever side and some of them constructively combines and some of them destructively combines. So final result of combination of all the incoming signals become very complicated and the combined signal becomes drastically different from the original signal tranmitted from the source. In most case, the quality\nof the combined signal at the reciever gets poorer (deteriorated) than the original signal. This kind of process of signal deterioration by the multiple propogation path of a signal is called 'Fading'. When we say \"Fading\", it usually implies \"Signal quality gets bad\".\n\nFor more intuitive unerstanding of the fading, I will show you a couple of different aspect of fading you can mesure using various equipments.\n\nFirst, let's compare a faded signal and non-faded signal using a spectrum analyzer. You would get the two results as follows and you will see the highly fluctuating amplitude across the channel bandwidth. (Note : These two capture are not the one from the same signal, so comparing the absolute value of the amplitude does not make any sense. Just take the image of overall amplitude profile).\n\nNow let's look at how the fading influence the signal quality decoded by the reciever. Look at the following samples of constellation for faded and non-faded signal.\n\nNow let's get into even further and I think this is the thing that you would be most interested in. How this fading would influence the final performance. Following graph shows the data rate at PHY layer and PDCP layer. The plot showing at the top (labeled as 'PHY Transmission Rate') is the amount of data being transmitted per second by PHY layer of the transmitter. The plot in the middle\n(labeled as 'PHY throughput with HARQ ACK' is the amount of data getting ACKED per second from the reiever PHY layer. You see there is pretty much gap between the two plots. It means that a considerable portions of the data were failed to get properly decoded by the reciever and the reciever sent NACK for the data. Normally in this case, the transmitter PHY layer retransmits the previous data rather than moving into the next step of the transmission.\n\nThe plot at the bottom (labelled as 'PDCP Transmission Rate') is the amount of data being sent to the lower layer from the transmitter's PDCP layer. You will see another gap here. It is not easy to explain exactly what is causing this gap. In this case, some portions of the gap would come from the overhead of higher layer data structure but majority of the gap would be because PDCP cannot\npush the data down to the lower layer since PHY layer is too busy with retransmitting the previous data rather than transmitting the new data coming from the higher layer.\n\nThere are many factors generating Fading effect. Followings are the list of components (factors) of fading we can think of.\n\nTo study on fading requires the detailed understanding of each of these components. If I express some major components in visual form, it can be presented as follows. Just from the high level view, you should see some typtical pattern from this representation. First notice that the horizontal axis represents 'Distance in Linear Scale'. You may have seen a lot of different plots in various\ntextbook and get confused by those. One of the first step to remove those confusion would be clearly understanding the meaning of axis of the graph. Even for the same things, you would see different shape of plots if you define the meaning of the axis differently. One of the factors from various text confusing you the most is the scale of each axis. For example, in case of path loss graph in some textbook where they represent the axis in log scale you would see a straight line, but in this page you\nare seeing a kind of negative exponential graph since the axis is represented in linear scale.\n\nPath loss is just gradually decreases but not much of fluctuation. In the second plot, you see some fluctuation of the signal strength but the fluctuation frequency over the distance is not that high. In the third plot, you see fluctuations of signal strength and the fluctuation frequency is also pretty high.\n\nWhen you observe a real received signal, you wouldn't see these factors in separate form as in the graph on the left side. What you see at the real reciever is the result of summation of all the factors and it is like the graph on the right side.\n\nProbably the words you might have heard the most frequently when you talking about fading would be 'Fast Fading', 'Slow Fading'. Intuitively it sounds simple. But not easy to find clear/technical defintion for these. How fast it should be to be Fast Fading ? How slow it should be to be Slow Fading ?\n\nI found a very good definition and technical explanation from the reference [2]. It states as follows:\n\nFast Fading is used to describe channels in which Channel Coherence Time < Tansmission Symbol Time. Fast Fading describes a condition where the time duration in which the channel behaves in a correlated mannel is short compared to the time duration of a symbol. Therefore, it can be expected that the fading characteristic of the channel will change several times while a symbol is propagating, leading to distortion of the baseband pulse shape. Analogous to the distortion described as ISI, the distortion take place because the recieved signal's components are not all highly correlated throughout time. Hence, fast fading can cause the baseband pulse to be distorted, resulting in a loss of SNR that often yields an irreducible error rate. Such distorted pulses cause synchronization problems (failure of phase-locked-loop recievers), in addition to difficulties in adequately defining a matched filter.\n\nSlow Fading is used to describe channels in which Channel Coherence Time > Tansmission Symbol Time. Here, the time duration that the channel behaves in a correlated manner is long compared to the time duration of a transmission symbol. Thus, one can expect the channel state to virtually remain unchanged during the time in which a symbol is transmitted. The propaging symbols will likely not suffer from the pulse distortion. The primary degradation in a slow-fading channel, as with flat fading, is loss in SNR.\n\nPath Loss and Shadowing may not be considered to be a part of Fading in narrow sense, but it can be considered as a factor causing the fading in wider sense. Understanding or Modeling the path loss is not that difficult. You may see a mathematical model which you were faimilar with in your high school math. The famous format of anti-proportional to 'something squared'.\n\nModling for Path Loss is done with the respect to the distance between a transmitter and receiver. The key question is ..\n\nTest A) When a transmitter antenna is transmitting a certain (fixed) amount of energy and you put a measurement antenna which is a certain distance (let's call this distance as 'd') and measure the received(measured) energy. Once you get the value at a certain 'd', write down the value. And then move the reciever antenna a little bit further and do the same measurement and write down\nthe value. Repeat this process as you move 'd' further and further and collect all the measured value and plot it on the graph with horizontal axis = d and vertical axis = measured energy level (power). How would the plot look like ? Can you come up with an equation to represent the graph ?\n\nTest B) Now let's try a little bit different type of measurement. This time, draw a circle with radius d with the transmitter antenna at the center. and then put several antenna along the circumference and measure the received power at each antenna and plot the value with horizontal axis = location of receiver antenna and vertical axis = measured energy level (power). How would the\nplot look like ?\n\nTest C) Now let's think about two test environment. In one setup there is no obstacles between the reciever and transmitter antenna (Let's call this as 'Setup A'). In the other setup, there are a lot of obstacles (like building, tree, houses, mountain etc) between the transmitter antenna and reciever antenna (Let's call this as 'Setup B'). Then you do the measurement described in Test\nB) for both setup and compare the result. Would you see any difference ? what kind of difference would you see ?\n\nThese three test will be used as a basis for modeling following cases. (Details will come later)\n\nThe first thing we can think of is a kind of ideal case called 'Free Space'. In this case, we assume that there is no obstacles between the transmitter and reciever antenna.\n\nIn this case, the measured power at every reciever antenna at the same distance from the transmitter antenna would be same and the received signal power can be modeled as follows. (Basically this equation is a form of Frris' Transmission Equation )\n\nIf you want to convert this equation to a form which most of RF engineers are more familiar with (dBm scale), you can just apply 10 log( ) on both side and go through following steps. Of course, you don't have to memorize the each of these steps. Just try to understand overall concept and logic of this process.\n\nLife would be much easier if the condition between the transmission antenna and reciever antenna is always as decribed in previous case (Free Space).\n\nIn real life situation, it is highly likely that you would see a lot of obstacles (like building, Tree, mountain etc). If I draw this situation in a little bit simplified way, it would be as follows.\n\nThe path loss at a certain distance can be expressed as follows. Compare this with the free space case. What kind of difference do you see ?\n\nIn case of free space model, once the distance is determined the received power can be determined automatically meaning that if d is fixed(same), you would get the same measured value (recieved power) for every measurement. But in this case, you cannot gurantee the same measured value even though the distance is same. Even though d is same, you would get the different measured value if beta\n(Path Loss Exponent) is different or epsilon (Random Variable) is different.\n\nThen the question would be 'How the Path Loss Exponent and Random Variable is determined ?'. There is no strict theory that can determine these values deterministically. It is usually determined empirically. According to various researches,\n\nIf you apply Log (10 log[ ] more specifically) to both side, you can get a linear equation in dB (dBm) scalse as shown below.\n\nA defining characteristic of the mobile wireless channel is to build up a mathematical model for the variations of the channel strength over time and over frequency. There are mainly two factors influencing the variations of the channel strength as listed below.\n\nAs a starting point, please... please ... please ... read very carefully about the section of Signal Presentation, Impulse Response and Convolution section before you go deeper into this section.\n\nLet's suppose we have a case as shown below. A UE is communicating with a eNodeB and there is a lot of building between the UE and the eNodeB. You may intuitively guess the eNodeB would get the multiple copies of the same signal from UE because the same signal can reach the eNodeB via multiple path as shown below. Let's assume that we have four different path as shown below. There are two\nmajor characteristics of the paths. One is attenuation and the other one is time delay. Of course there would be several additional factors, but these two components would be the largest factors. Let's assume that each of the path has the delay and attenuation as shown below.\n\nHow do we represent a channel using these delay and attenuator factor ? There can be a couple of different ways to represent it, but one of the most common way would be to represent it as an impulse response model. Even though you may not familiar with the term 'impulse response', you may have seen this kind of description if you have any experience of using channel simulators (fader) and\ndealt with fading profile. Following is the graphical representation of impulse response of the four paths in this example and physical meaning of it. I hope this make sense to you.\n\nIf you represent this impulse response into a mathematical form, it become as follows. If you are not familiar with this kind of mathematical representation. Read again the section of Signal Representation. (When you are first learning this way of signal representation.. you may think .. what the hell is delta function\n? Why we need this kind of function ? etc... this is one example why you need to learn those textbook concept).\n\nLet's look into a example that (hopefully) would give you more concrete understanding of these concepts.\n\nLet's suppose that a signal goes through six different path (multipath) as indicated in plot (1). Horizontal axis represents the time delay from the transmission to arrival at the reciever antenna. Vertical axis indicates the amplitude of the received signal. plot(2)~(7) shows the signal going through each path reaching to Rx antenna. If you look at each plots, you would notice that the phase\n(time delay) and amplitude are different from each other. plot (8) shows the summation of all the plots from (2) through (6). This is the signal being sensed by the recieving antenna.\n\nWhat do you observe from the plot (8) (the sum of all the multipath signal) ? You would notice that the amplitude and phase gets different from the transmitted signal, but overall shape of the signal is same as the transmitted signal. It means that no distortion happened by this multipath.\n\nNow let's think of how the received signal is influenced by the multipath with the frequency of the transmitted signal. I created plots for three different frequency (In this case, the amplitude of transmitted signal are same for all frequencies). As you see at plot (8) of each case (w=1,2,5), the amplitude of the total received signal gets different depending on frequency.\n\nNote : This shows the cases of only three different frequencies. Isn't there any way of showing the amplitude of total received signal for all the different frequencies in easier way ? We will look into this shortly.\n\nFollowing is the Octave source code (I think this would work with Matlab as well) for the graphs shown above, try playing the list 'a' and 'tau', get some intuitive understanding on your own.\n\nplot(t,real(exp_iwt)); xlim([0 2]);ylim([-1 1]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[-1 0 1]);\n\nplot(t,imag(exp_iwt)); xlim([0 2]);ylim([-1 1]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[-1 0 1]);\n\nplot(t,real(exp_iwt_sum),'r-'); xlim([0 2]);ylim([-3 3]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[-3 0 3]);\n\nplot(t,imag(exp_iwt_sum),'r-'); xlim([0 2]);ylim([-3 3]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[-3 0 3]);\n\nplot(w,real(Hw)); xlim([0 wmax]);ylim([-1 1]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[-1 0 1]);\n\nplot(w,imag(Hw)); xlim([0 wmax]);ylim([-1 1]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[-1 0 1]);\n\nplot(w,abs(Hw)); xlim([0 wmax]);ylim([0 1]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[0 1]);\n\nplot(w,real(Hw_sum),'r-'); xlim([0 wmax]);ylim([-5 5]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[-5 0 5]);\n\nplot(w,imag(Hw_sum),'r-'); xlim([0 wmax]);ylim([-5 5]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[-5 0 5]);\n\nplot(w,abs(Hw_sum),'r-'); xlim([0 wmax]);ylim([0 5]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[0 5]);\n\nNow we have a channel described in the form of impulse response. Let's suppose that we have a signal x(t) going through the channel. The x(t) will split into multiple pathes in the channel and take the different route and finally recombine at the receiver antenna. What would the signal at the receiving antenna look like ? There is an excellent mathematical tool to give you the answer to this\nquestion. It is a tool called 'Convolution'. If you just take the convolution of channel impulse response and input signal (x(t)), you would take the signal at the receiving antenna.\n\nWhen we specify a Fading Channel profile, we are usually given a table with tap delay and relative power for each tap. You may visualize the table as shown below. Usually those profile table in the specification does not specify statistical information for the tap, but usually some specific statistical profile is associated with each tap. In case of LTE channel profile (Tap Delay Line : TDL), usually each tap is associated with statistical power profile as shown below. Usually the first tap indicates the fading on line of sight path that is modeled in Rician distribution and the remaining taps indicates the fading channel on non line of sight path that is modeled in Rayleigh distribution.\n\nWhen it comes to using this channel profile in fading implementation, I would take this as the impulse response of the fading channel. Then, the modeling of a signal passing through a fading channel can be represented as the convolution of signal and the fading channel as illustrated below.\n\nSound simple ? Yes simple conceptually, but there is a difficulties in reality. It is about how to apply the statistically property associated with each tap.\n\nEach tap is associated with a specific statistical power and doppler profile. It mean that the power for each tap for each steps of convolution changes and the frequency shift for each tap for each steps of convolution changes according to specific statistical profile as illustrated below.\n\nApplying these changing impulse response, the faded signal is generated as illustrated below. (In real implementation, there are various techniques are used to generate this kind of varing channel impulse response. One widely used mathology is to use Jake's model).\n\nIn addition to this delay, gain, PDF, we have to think about the correlations among all the antenna on transmitter and reciever side as follows.\n\nThese correlation is defined in 3GPP as shown below and this correlation matrix should be applied to the Fading model when we use multiple antenna configuration.\n\nDo you see any difference between the matrix shown above (channel matrix) for 2 x 2 MIMO and the correlation matrix as shown below for 2 x 2 case ?\n\nOne obvious difference is size of the matrix. The channel matrix shown above is 2x2 matrix and the correlation matrix for 2 x 2 case shown below is 4x4.\n\nAny idea on how the 2x2 matrix show above is converted to 4 x 4 matrix shown below ?\n\n(The full correlation matrices is obtained by Tensor Product/Kronecker product\nof two antenna correlation matrix)\n\nLet's start with the simplest case and add piece by piece until we reach more realistic (complex) cases.\n\nLet's suppose that you have two Tx antenna and one Rx antenna. If draw this situation as in channel model, you can draw this setup as follows. (Let's call this a Case A)\n\nIn this setup, you have two channel path(channel coefficient) h1 and h2. Now let's think about all the possible relation between these two channel. If you draw all the possible relationships as a diagram, you may represent as follows.\n\nIf you represent these relationship between the two channel path (channel coefficient) in a matrix format, you can represent it as follows. (I would not explain it in detail but you would need to have some intuitive understanding of vector/matrix. This is why you should have taken such a boring linear algebra course in the university. If you are really new to this vector/matrix concept,\nVector/Matrix page on this site). Be careful, you may get confused with 2 x 2 matrix to be used to model 2 x 2 MIMO channel. (At least I was confused a lot at the beginning. I would not talk too much about it, but I strongly recommend you to compare the two matrix and clearly understand the difference between them). Just to give you the conclusion about the difference between the two matrix, the matrix shown\nhere represents the correlation between each channel path(the path the signal flow through) and the matrix shown in channel model represents the correlation between Tx and Rx antenna.\n\nThe 'Beta' value represents the cross correlation between channel coefficient h1 and h2.\n\nNow we have a different case. In this case, you have two Tx antenna and one Rx antenna. If draw this situation as in channel model, you can draw this setup as follows. (Let's call this a Case B)\n\nIf you represent these relationship between the two channel path (channel coefficient) in a diagram, you can represent it as follows.\n\nIf you represent these relationship between the two channel path (channel coefficient) in a matrix format,, you can represent it as follows.The 'Alpha' value represents the cross correlation between channel coefficient h1 and h2.\n\nNow let's look into more complicated case. In this case, you have two transmitter antenna and two reciever antenna. The antenna and channel path can be illustrated as follows. You can think of this as a combination of Case A and Case B described above.\n\nNow if you represents the correlations between each of these channel coefficients, it can be represented as follows.\n\nAs you did in case A and B, if you represents these correlations in vector/matrix format, you would get a big matrix as follows. How did you get the last matrix ?. Actually it came from the matrix for Case A and B described above. If you clearly understood the meaning of Beta and Alpha in Case A and B, you would easily understand how each of the elements in this big matrix can be represented\nas 'Alpha' or 'Beta'.\n\nwhat about the '?' part shown above ? Filling out these '?' is not so straigtforward. If you brow the statical concept (I cannot explain though :)), those parts are the places where the correlation between part of Case A and part of Case B and can be filled as follows.\n\nHow to derive MIMO coeifficient matrix mathematically from Diversity coefficient matrix ?\n\nI have explained how we got 2x2 MIMO correlation matrix from physical perspective and the each elements of 2 x 2 MIMO matrix can be derived from the elements of 2x1 Diversity matrix. I strongly recommend you to try to get familiar with this concept and build your own intuition. But as the number of antenna increases, deriving all the correlation matrix as I described above would not be that\neasy. Fortunately there is a mathematical way of deriving the MIMO correlation matrix from Diversity Correlation matrix. The MIMO correlation matrix can be derived by taking Kronecker product of two Diversity matrix as shown below. (If you are not familar with the concept of Kronecker product, refer to this page)\n\nThe last component I want to show you about Fading is Doppler spread. Doppler spread is caused by the well known phenomenon called 'Doppler Shift' (I would not explain what Doppler shift is. Everybody would learned about this from High school physics and you can easily google out a lot of explanation of this effect).\n\nDoppler spread can be expressed as shown in following function and plot. If you think of 'Doppler spread' as a kind of filter (or a block in a control system model). You can take the following function as a kind of transfer function of the filter.\n\nAs you see, how much a frequency (fc) get spreaded by doppler spread is indicated by fm. If you see another formula below the graph representing fm, you would see fm is determined by the velocity of object (relative velocify between transmitter and reciever) and speed of light and fc(carrier frequency). You know fc is constant (set by standard and assume hardware is good enough to maintain\nthe fc the same). Now the only variable is the speed v. According to this equation, fm and v are in proportional relation, meaning if v gets higher, fm gets larger (the width of the graph gets wider) and if v gets smaller, fm gets smaller (the width of the graph gets narrower).\n\nHow this kind of plot is obtained ? What is the meaning of this plot. Let's think a little bit further into how we get this plot.\n\nLet's assume that a car (e.g, a phone in a car) is moving in horizontal direction and it is receiving a signal with an angle illustrated as in (A). Since the car is moving, the phone in the car would experience doppler shift. Since the UE is getting the signal with an angle, the doppler shift it percieves can be represented as in red arrow in (B).\n\nNow let's extend this situation further to the situation where the UE in the moving car is receiving the signal from all direction as illustrated below. This is the situation where the UE has so many reflectors around it and recieves the multipath signal all around. Then the doppler shift that UE percieves is like red dots marked on the horizontal line. If you plot those red dots in probability distribution function, you will get the red plot as shown below.\n\nNow you may have question. How differently the narrow Doppler spread and wide doppler spread affect on the signal ?\n\nThe simulation result for these two cases (narrow and wide doppler spread) is shown below. The upper track is for narrow doppler spread and the lower track is for wide doppler spread. As you see, you see much frequency energy fluctuation over time in wide Doppler spectrum. I will update the page later about the mathmatical background.\n\nIf you are using a phone in high speed train, the distance between UE and eNB changes very fast. It means both UE and eNB will be under drastic doppler shift.\n\nFor example, let's suppose the train is traveling right into the eNB as illustrated below (the eNB is right on top of the railway). Of course, you don't see this kind of situation in real life. The train will crash into the eNB in this case. However, just suppose this is possible and train can go through a ghost-like eNB. In this case and assume that the speed of the train is constant, the doppler shift will stay constant as well. The only change is the direction of frequency shift changes as the train pass through eNB as illustrated below.\n\nHowever, in realy you don't see any case shown above in real life. In real life, the eNB is located away from the rail way at certain distance.\n\nIn this case, the Doppler Shift changes as the train get closer to, pass by and farther away from the eNB. The doppler shift at a specific time is represented as shown below (36.101 B.3)\n\nWhere does this equation come from ? It turned out to be from hunior high school geometry, but it took me long time to understand this since there is no background information in 3GPP.\n\nThis model is based on the assumption that the eNBs are spaced equaly and the train moves at a constant speed. It is also assumed that the initial location of the train (the location at t = 0) on the railway is at the mid point between two adjacent eNBs as shown below. Dmin is defined as the closest possible distance between UE and eNB and the initial location is specified to be half way between two adjacent eNBs. Then, the distance between the eNB and the train can be derived. If we define the angle theta as shown below, the cos(theta) will become as below.\n\nNow let's look into a snapshot after t seconds. Now the location of the train on the railway and the distance between UE and eNB, and the cos(theta) is derived as shown below. (Just try to derive on your own or just copy it with a pen on a paper, you will understand it clearly).\n\nIf you plot the doppler shift with time as traing travel along the railway, it would be illustrated as shown below.\n\nFollowing is the Matlab code that I wrote based on the equation shown above. In this, I calculated not only frequency shift but also the angle(theta) to figure out the location of the train more easily.\n\nNow let's do some experiment with the code to understand the impact of the parameters. The first experiment is to change the speed of the train keeping all other parameters same. The doppler shift that UE (on the train) will experience can be plotted as shown below. See if this is aligned with your intuitive understanding.\n\nNow let's do another experiement. In this experiement, I changed Dmin keeping all other parameters same. The doppler shift that UE (on the train) will experience can be plotted as shown below. See if this is aligned with your intuitive understanding.\n\nTypical model for Fading channel can be described by a simple diagram as follows. This is very simplified model but fortunately this is almost enough for 3GPP specification for fading test. As you see, a signal comes into the fading block and splits into multiple path. Each path has three components, namely Delay, PDF, Gain component. By changing these parameters in each path,\nyou can construct pretty complicated fading channel.\n\nIn LTE 3GPP specification, typical three types of Fading profiles are defined as follows.\n\nGo through following pages (examples) and try to get some intuitive understanding on your own.\n\n[2] Rayleigh Fading Channels in Mobile Digital Communication Systems.

There may be zero, one, or several uplink DPDCHs on each radio link.\n\nThe uplink DPCCH is used to carry control information generated at Layer 1. The Layer 1 control information consists of known pilot bits to support channel estimation for coherent detection, transmit power-control (TPC) commands, feedback information (FBI), and an optional transport-format combination indicator (TFCI). The transport-format combination indicator informs the receiver about the instantaneous transport format combination of the transport channels mapped to the simultaneously transmitted uplink DPDCH radio frame. There is one and only one uplink DPCCH on each radio link. The uplink DPCCH may also carry DL FET ACK/NACK signalling information for DL FET operation when DL_DCH_FET_Config = 1.\n\nThe uplink DPCCH2 is used to carry control information generated at Layer 1. The Layer 1 control information consists of known pilot bits to support channel estimation for coherent detection, and transmit power-control (TPC) commands. When DPCCH2 is configured there is one and only one uplink DPCCH2 for all radio links. When DPCCH2 is configured, the UE shall transmit DPCCH2 only in the slots in which DPCCH is transmitted.\n\nThe uplink S-DPCCH is used to carry control information generated at Layer 1. The Layer 1 control information consists of known pilot bits to support channel sounding and channel estimation for coherent detection. There is up to one uplink S-DPCCH on each radio link in the case that UL_CLTD_Enabled as defined in [5] is TRUE. Figure 1 shows the frame structure of the uplink DPDCH, the uplink DPCCH, the uplink DPCCH2 and the uplink S-DPCCH. Each radio frame of length 10 ms is split into 5 subframes, each of 3 slots, each of length Tslot = 2560 chips, corresponding to one power-control period. The DPDCH, DPCCH, S-DPCCH and DPCCH2 are always frame aligned with each other.\n\nThe parameter k in figure 1 determines the number of bits per uplink DPDCH slot. It is related to the spreading factor SF of the DPDCH as SF = 256/2k. The DPDCH spreading factor may range from 256 down to 4. The spreading factor of the uplink DPCCH, the uplink DPCCH2 and the uplink S-DPCCH is always equal to 256, i.e. there are 10 bits per uplink DPCCH/S-DPCCH/DPCCH2 slot.\n\nThe exact number of bits of the uplink DPDCH and the different uplink DPCCH fields (Npilot, NTFCI, NFBI, and NTPC) is given by table 1 and table 2. What slot format to use is configured by higher layers and can also be reconfigured by higher layers. The exact number of bits of the uplink S-DPCCH is given by table 2A.\n\nThe uplink DPCCH2 reuses slot format #1 of DPCCH, and the exact number of bits is given in table 2.\n\nThe channel bit and symbol rates given in table 1, table 2 and table 2A are the rates immediately before spreading. The pilot patterns are given in table 3 and table 4, the TPC bit pattern is given in table 5.\n\nThe FBI bits are used to support techniques requiring feedback from the UE to the UTRAN Access Point for operation of closed loop mode transmit diversity. The use of the FBI bits is described in detail in [5].\n\nThere are two types of uplink dedicated physical channels; those that include TFCI (e.g. for several simultaneous services) and those that do not include TFCI (e.g. for fixed-rate services). These types are reflected by the duplicated rows of table 2. It is the UTRAN that determines if a TFCI should be transmitted and it is mandatory for all UEs to support the use of TFCI in the uplink. The mapping of TFCI bits onto slots is described in [3].\n\nDPCCH slot format 5 is used when DL_DCH_FET_Config is configured by higher layers. In this case, over a 20ms Compression Interval (CI) consisting of 30 slots, the bits in the TFCI field carry TFCI information in the first 10 slots, and may carry an ACK/NACK indicator for DL FET in the remaining 20 slots. The ACK/NACK for DL FET is sent when DL_DCH_FET_Config = 1.\n\nIn compressed mode, DPCCH slot formats with TFCI fields are changed. There are two possible compressed slot formats for normal slot formats 0 and 2. They are labelled A and B and the selection between them is dependent on the number of slots that are transmitted in each frame in compressed mode. When DL_DCH_FET_Config is configured by higher layers, UL DPCCH slot format 5 is used in compressed mode. In compressed mode when UL_DCH_FET_Config is configured by higher layers, TFCI bits represent TFCI information in the first 10 slots that are not in compressed-mode gaps in a 20ms CI. The TFCI bits in subsequent slots that are not in the compressed mode gaps represent ACK/NACK indication for DL FET when DL_DCH_FET_Config = 1.\n\nIf UL_DTX_Active is TRUE (see [5]), the number of transmitted slots per radio frame may be less than the number shown in Table 2 and Table 2A.\n\nThe pilot bit pattern for S-DPCCH is the same as that for uplink DPCCH with Npilot = 8. The Nfixed bits in the S-DPCCH are fixed to \"10\".\n\nThe pilot bit pattern for DPCCH2 is the same as that for uplink DPCCH with Npilot = 8.\n\nThe pilot bit patterns are described in table 3 and table 4. The shadowed column part of pilot bit pattern is defined as FSW and FSWs can be used to confirm frame synchronization. (The value of the pilot bit pattern other than FSWs shall be \"1\".)\n\nThe relationship between the TPC bit pattern and transmitter power control command is presented in table 5.\n\nMulti-code operation is possible for the uplink dedicated physical channels. When multi-code transmission is used, several parallel DPDCH are transmitted using different channelization codes, see [4]. However, there is only one DPCCH per radio link, one DPCCH2 if DPCCH2 is configured and up to one S-DPCCH in the case that UL_CLTD_Enable is TRUE.\n\nA period of uplink DPCCH transmission prior to the start of the uplink DPDCH transmission (uplink DPCCH power control preamble) shall be used for initialisation of a DCH. The length of the power control preamble is a higher layer parameter, Npcp , signalled by the network [5]. The UL DPCCH shall take the same slot format in the power control preamble as afterwards, as given in table 2. When Npcp > 0 the pilot patterns of table 3 and table 4 shall be used. The timing of the power control preamble is described in [5], subclause 4.3.2.3. The TFCI field is filled with \"0\" bits.",

Tech.: Equalizer\n\nIn wireless communication (actually in any communication), the signal always go through a physical medium (mostly air and anything outside of the transmitter antenna in wirelss communication) before it reaches the reciever. In most cases, these channels tend not to be in the best environement for the signal and put some negative impact on the signal. As a result, the reciever would get the signal that is distorted or corrupted by the channel as illustrated below.\n\nIf the distortion or corruption by the channel gets too serious, proper communication cannot happen. Then, how can we ensure that the transmitted signal(data) can be properly recieved(decoded) by the reciever even when the signal is distorted or corrupted by the wireless channel ? One most common solution is to use a special component called Equalizer. This component can be in the form of hardware or software or both. Equalizer is a special component(a block) that can UNDO the distortion / corruption done by channel while the signal pass through the channel.\n\nIt may sound like a magic when you first heard of what the equalizer do and may ask yourself how such a magic can happen.\n\nTo explain on this, I would translate the block diagram shown in previous section into a mathematical format as shown below. (If you want to know about further details on H in this equation, refer to channel model page).\n\nAs I mentioned above, usally the H distorts or corrupt the signal which make it difficult for the reciever to decode the signal. The goal is to undo the effect of H. Mathematical point of view, it is very simple. Just take the inverse of H (channel) and apply it to the received signal (Hx). Basically what Equalizer do is to calculate the inverse of channel matrix and correct (compensate) the received signal.\n\nAs everybody in the engineering would know, there is nothing as easy as said. Same applies to Equalization as well. As mentioned in previous section, ideally Equalization is just to take the inverse of channel matrix and applies it to the received signal, but there are some mathematical and technical chalenges and preconditions.\n\nTo obtain the inverse of the channel matrix, the channel matrix should satisfy specific conditions as follows.\n\nTo overcome these mathmatical restriction, we use many other techniques that can applies to non square matrix. Most of the commonly used Equalization method like least squre, SVD, MMSE can be applied to non-square matrices.\n\nNow let's suppose we have the means to overcome the mathematical constrains. But we still have some practical challenges to overcome.\n\nConceptually, Equalization is to get the inverse (or pseudo inverse) of the channel matrix. It mean that the channel matrix should be given to Equalizer. How do I (meaning the reciever) know about the channel matrix ? If channel does not change at all, we may investigate about the channel before we build the communication system and preprogram the channel matrix directly into the reciever, but we cannot expect this kind of constant (never changing) channel condition in wireless communication. Channel property changes all the time in wireless environment. It means the reciever itself has to figure out the channel characteristics and build the channel matrix dynamically. This process (i.e, finding out channel characteristics) is called channel estimation. There are various kind of channel estimation techniques and some of those techniques are explained in this page.\n\nNOTE : Click on the image and it will lead you to the page with more examples and the Octave source code that I wrote for the examples.",

Operators have met this challenge by increasing capacity with new radio spectrum, adding multi-antenna techniques and implementing more efficient modulation and coding schemes.\n\nHowever, these measures alone are insufficient in the most crowded environments and at cell edges where performance can significantly degrade. Operators are also adding small cells and tightly-integrating these with their macro networks to spread traffic loads, widely maintain performance and service quality while reusing spectrum most efficiently.\n\nOne way to expand an existing macro-network, while maintaining it as a homogeneous network, is to \"densify\" it by adding more sectors per eNB or deploying more macro-eNBs. However, reducing the site-to-site distance in the macro-network can only be pursued to a certain extent because finding new macro-sites becomes increasingly difficult and can be expensive, especially in city centres. An alternative is to introduce small cells through the addition of low-power base stations (eNBs, HeNBs or Relay Nodes (RNs)) or Remote Radio Heads (RRH) to existing macro-eNBs. Site acquisition is easier and cheaper with this equipment which is also correspondingly smaller.\n\nSmall cells are primarily added to increase capacity in hot spots with high user demand and to fill in areas not covered by the macro network - both outdoors and indoors. They also improve network performance and service quality by offloading from the large macro-cells. The result is a heterogeneous network with large macro-cells in combination with small cells providing increased bitrates per unit area. See Figure 1.\n\nHeterogeneous network planning was already used in GSM. The large and small cells in GSM are separated through the use of different frequencies. This solution is still possible in LTE. However, LTE networks mainly use a frequency reuse of one to maximize utilization of the licensed bandwidth.\n\nIn heterogeneous networks the cells of different sizes are referred to as macro-, micro-, pico- and femto-cells; listed in order of decreasing base station power. The actual cell size depends not only on the eNB power but also on antenna position, as well as the location environment; e.g. rural or city, indoor or outdoor . The HeNB (Home eNB) was introduced in LTE Release 9 (R9). It is a low power eNB which is mainly used to provide indoor coverage, femto-cells, for Closed Subscriber Groups (CSG), for example, in office premises. See Figure 2.\n\nSpecific to HeNBs, is that they are privately owned and deployed without coordination with the macro-network. If the frequency used in the femto-cell is the same as the frequency used in the macro-cells, and the femto-cell is only used for CSG, then there is a risk of interference between the femto-cell and the surrounding network.\n\nThe Relay Node (RN) is another type of low-power base station added to the LTE R10 specifications. The RN is connected to a Donor eNB (DeNB) via the Un radio interface, which is based on the LTE Uu interface. See Figure 2. When the frequencies used on Uu and Un for the RN are the same, there is a risk of self interference in the RN. From the UE perspective the RN will act as an eNB, and from the DeNB's view the RN will be seen as a UE. As also mentioned, RRHs connected to an eNB via fibre can be used to provide small cell coverage.\n\nIntroducing a mix of cell sizes and generating a heterogeneous network adds to the complexity of network planning. In a network with a frequency reuse of one, the UE normally camps on the cell with the strongest received DL signal (SSDL), hence the border between two cells is located at the point where SSDL is the same in both cells. In homogeneous networks, this also typically coincides with the point of equal path loss for the UL (PLUL) in both cells. In a heterogeneous network, with high-power nodes in the large cells and low-power nodes in the small cells, the point of equal SSDL will not necessarily be the same as that of equal PLUL. See Figure 3.\n\nA major issue in heterogeneous network planning is to ensure that the small cells actually serve enough users. One way to do that is to increase the area served by the small cell, which can be done through the use of a positive cell selection offset to the SSDL of the small cell. This is called Cell Range Extension (CRE). See Figure 4.\n\nA negative effect of this is the increased interference on the DL experienced by the UE located in the CRE region and served by the base station in the small cell. This may impact the reception of the DL control channels in particular.\n\nA number of features added to the 3GPP LTE specification can be used to mitigate the above-mentioned interference problem in heterogeneous networks with small cells:\n\nICIC was introduced in R8. The eNBs can communicate using ICIC via the X2 interface to mitigate inter-cell interference for UEs at the cell edge. The X2AP message used for this is called \"Load Information\". See Figure 5. Through the \"Load Information\" message an eNB can inform neighbouring eNBs about: UL interference level per Physical Resource Block (PRB); UL PRBs that are allocated to cell edge UEs, and hence are sensitive to UL interference; and if DL Tx power is higher or lower than a set threshold value. The eNBs receiving these messages can use the received information to optimize scheduling for UEs at cell edges.\n\nICIC has evolved to better support heterogeneous network deployments -- especially interference control for DL control channels. Enhanced ICIC (eICIC) was introduced in LTE R10. The major change is the addition of time domain ICIC, realized through use of Almost Blank Subframes (ABS). ABS includes only control channels and cell-specific reference signals, no user data, and is transmitted with reduced power. When eICIC is used, the macro-eNB will transmit ABS according to a semi-static pattern. During these subframes, UEs at the edge, typically in the CRE region of small cells, can receive DL information, both control and user data. The macro-eNB will inform the eNB in the small cell about the ABS pattern. See Figure 6.\n\nICIC is evolved in LTE R11 to further enhanced ICIC (feICIC). The focus here is interference handling by the UE through inter-cell interference cancellation for control signals, enabling even further cell range extension.\n\neICIC and feICIC are especially important when Carrier Aggregation (CA) is not used.\n\nCarrier Aggregation (CA) is introduced in R10, with backward compatibility to R8, to increase the total bandwidth available to UEs and hence their maximum bitrates. When CA is used a number of R8 carriers, referred to as Component Carriers (CC), are aggregated and any CA-capable UE can be allocated resources on all CCs, while R8/R9 UEs can only be allocated resources on one CC. Cross-carrier scheduling is an important feature in heterogeneous networks. Using cross-carrier scheduling it is possible to map the Physical DL control channels (PDCCH) on different CCs in the large and small cells. See Figure 7. The PDCCH, carrying DL Control Information (DCI) with scheduling information, must be received by the UEs at the cell edge; PDCCH may be transmitted with higher power than the traffic channels. Hence, using different carriers for the PDCCH in the large and small cells reduces the risk of PDCCH interference.\n\nFrom LTE R11 onwards it is possible to handle CA with CCs requiring different timing advance (TA); for example, combining CCs from eNBs with CCs from RRHs. See Figure 8.\n\nOne way to ensure that a UE is using both the best DL and the best UL carrier in a heterogeneous network is to use CoMP, introduced in LTE R11. With CoMP a number of transmission/reception points (i.e. eNBs, RNs or RRHs) can be coordinated to provide service to a UE - for example, data can be transmitted at the same time in the same PRBs from more than one transmission point to one UE, or data can be received from one transmission point in one subframe and from another transmission point in the next subframe. CoMP can be used both in DL and UL. When CoMP is used in a heterogeneous network a number of macro-cells and small cells can be involved in data transmission to and from one UE. Especially useful in heterogeneous networks is the possibility for a UE in the cell range extension region to utilize the best UL in the small cell and the best DL in the macro-cell. See Figure 9. This, however, requires that the macro-eNB and the base station in the small cell are synchronized, and most likely it will require a combination of macro-eNB with RRHs in the small cell.\n\nFurther enhancements regarding heterogeneous network and small cells are coming in future 3GPP Releases.

It may use either the control- or user-plane protocols as underlying transport. In this specification, only control plane use of LPP is defined. User plane support of LPP is defined in [15] and [16].\n\nLPP messages are carried as transparent PDUs across intermediate network interfaces using the appropriate protocols (e.g., NGAP over the NG-C interface, NAS/RRC over the LTE-Uu and NR-Uu interfaces). The LPP protocol is intended to enable positioning for NR and LTE using a multiplicity of different position methods, while isolating the details of any particular positioning method and the specifics of the underlying transport from one another.\n\nThe protocol operates on a transaction basis between a target device and a server, with each transaction taking place as an independent procedure. More than one such procedure may be in progress at any given moment. An LPP procedure may involve a request/response pairing of messages or one or more \"unsolicited\" messages. Each procedure has a single objective (e.g., transfer of assistance data, exchange of LPP related capabilities, or positioning of a target device according to some QoS and use of one or more positioning methods). Multiple procedures, in series and/or in parallel, can be used to achieve more complex objectives (e.g., positioning of a target device in association with transfer of assistance data and exchange of LPP related capabilities). Multiple procedures also enable more than one positioning attempt to be ongoing at the same time (e.g., to obtain a coarse location estimate with low delay while a more accurate location estimate is being obtained with higher delay).\n\nAn LPP session is defined between a positioning server and the target device, the details of its relation with transactions are described in clause 4.1.2 of TS 36.355 [19].\n\nFor the 3GPP 5GS Control Plane solution defined in TS 23.501 [2] and TS 23.502 [26], the UE is the target device and the LMF is the server.

Operators have met this challenge by increasing capacity with new radio spectrum, adding multi-antenna techniques and implementing more efficient modulation and coding schemes.\n\nHowever, these measures alone are insufficient in the most crowded environments and at cell edges where performance can significantly degrade. Operators are also adding small cells and tightly-integrating these with their macro networks to spread traffic loads, widely maintain performance and service quality while reusing spectrum most efficiently.\n\nOne way to expand an existing macro-network, while maintaining it as a homogeneous network, is to \"densify\" it by adding more sectors per eNB or deploying more macro-eNBs. However, reducing the site-to-site distance in the macro-network can only be pursued to a certain extent because finding new macro-sites becomes increasingly difficult and can be expensive, especially in city centres. An alternative is to introduce small cells through the addition of low-power base stations (eNBs, HeNBs or Relay Nodes (RNs)) or Remote Radio Heads (RRH) to existing macro-eNBs. Site acquisition is easier and cheaper with this equipment which is also correspondingly smaller.\n\nSmall cells are primarily added to increase capacity in hot spots with high user demand and to fill in areas not covered by the macro network - both outdoors and indoors. They also improve network performance and service quality by offloading from the large macro-cells. The result is a heterogeneous network with large macro-cells in combination with small cells providing increased bitrates per unit area. See Figure 1.\n\nHeterogeneous network planning was already used in GSM. The large and small cells in GSM are separated through the use of different frequencies. This solution is still possible in LTE. However, LTE networks mainly use a frequency reuse of one to maximize utilization of the licensed bandwidth.\n\nIn heterogeneous networks the cells of different sizes are referred to as macro-, micro-, pico- and femto-cells; listed in order of decreasing base station power. The actual cell size depends not only on the eNB power but also on antenna position, as well as the location environment; e.g. rural or city, indoor or outdoor . The HeNB (Home eNB) was introduced in LTE Release 9 (R9). It is a low power eNB which is mainly used to provide indoor coverage, femto-cells, for Closed Subscriber Groups (CSG), for example, in office premises. See Figure 2.\n\nSpecific to HeNBs, is that they are privately owned and deployed without coordination with the macro-network. If the frequency used in the femto-cell is the same as the frequency used in the macro-cells, and the femto-cell is only used for CSG, then there is a risk of interference between the femto-cell and the surrounding network.\n\nThe Relay Node (RN) is another type of low-power base station added to the LTE R10 specifications. The RN is connected to a Donor eNB (DeNB) via the Un radio interface, which is based on the LTE Uu interface. See Figure 2. When the frequencies used on Uu and Un for the RN are the same, there is a risk of self interference in the RN. From the UE perspective the RN will act as an eNB, and from the DeNB's view the RN will be seen as a UE. As also mentioned, RRHs connected to an eNB via fibre can be used to provide small cell coverage.\n\nIntroducing a mix of cell sizes and generating a heterogeneous network adds to the complexity of network planning. In a network with a frequency reuse of one, the UE normally camps on the cell with the strongest received DL signal (SSDL), hence the border between two cells is located at the point where SSDL is the same in both cells. In homogeneous networks, this also typically coincides with the point of equal path loss for the UL (PLUL) in both cells. In a heterogeneous network, with high-power nodes in the large cells and low-power nodes in the small cells, the point of equal SSDL will not necessarily be the same as that of equal PLUL. See Figure 3.\n\nA major issue in heterogeneous network planning is to ensure that the small cells actually serve enough users. One way to do that is to increase the area served by the small cell, which can be done through the use of a positive cell selection offset to the SSDL of the small cell. This is called Cell Range Extension (CRE). See Figure 4.\n\nA negative effect of this is the increased interference on the DL experienced by the UE located in the CRE region and served by the base station in the small cell. This may impact the reception of the DL control channels in particular.\n\nA number of features added to the 3GPP LTE specification can be used to mitigate the above-mentioned interference problem in heterogeneous networks with small cells:\n\nICIC was introduced in R8. The eNBs can communicate using ICIC via the X2 interface to mitigate inter-cell interference for UEs at the cell edge. The X2AP message used for this is called \"Load Information\". See Figure 5. Through the \"Load Information\" message an eNB can inform neighbouring eNBs about: UL interference level per Physical Resource Block (PRB); UL PRBs that are allocated to cell edge UEs, and hence are sensitive to UL interference; and if DL Tx power is higher or lower than a set threshold value. The eNBs receiving these messages can use the received information to optimize scheduling for UEs at cell edges.\n\nICIC has evolved to better support heterogeneous network deployments -- especially interference control for DL control channels. Enhanced ICIC (eICIC) was introduced in LTE R10. The major change is the addition of time domain ICIC, realized through use of Almost Blank Subframes (ABS). ABS includes only control channels and cell-specific reference signals, no user data, and is transmitted with reduced power. When eICIC is used, the macro-eNB will transmit ABS according to a semi-static pattern. During these subframes, UEs at the edge, typically in the CRE region of small cells, can receive DL information, both control and user data. The macro-eNB will inform the eNB in the small cell about the ABS pattern. See Figure 6.\n\nICIC is evolved in LTE R11 to further enhanced ICIC (feICIC). The focus here is interference handling by the UE through inter-cell interference cancellation for control signals, enabling even further cell range extension.\n\neICIC and feICIC are especially important when Carrier Aggregation (CA) is not used.\n\nCarrier Aggregation (CA) is introduced in R10, with backward compatibility to R8, to increase the total bandwidth available to UEs and hence their maximum bitrates. When CA is used a number of R8 carriers, referred to as Component Carriers (CC), are aggregated and any CA-capable UE can be allocated resources on all CCs, while R8/R9 UEs can only be allocated resources on one CC. Cross-carrier scheduling is an important feature in heterogeneous networks. Using cross-carrier scheduling it is possible to map the Physical DL control channels (PDCCH) on different CCs in the large and small cells. See Figure 7. The PDCCH, carrying DL Control Information (DCI) with scheduling information, must be received by the UEs at the cell edge; PDCCH may be transmitted with higher power than the traffic channels. Hence, using different carriers for the PDCCH in the large and small cells reduces the risk of PDCCH interference.\n\nFrom LTE R11 onwards it is possible to handle CA with CCs requiring different timing advance (TA); for example, combining CCs from eNBs with CCs from RRHs. See Figure 8.\n\nOne way to ensure that a UE is using both the best DL and the best UL carrier in a heterogeneous network is to use CoMP, introduced in LTE R11. With CoMP a number of transmission/reception points (i.e. eNBs, RNs or RRHs) can be coordinated to provide service to a UE - for example, data can be transmitted at the same time in the same PRBs from more than one transmission point to one UE, or data can be received from one transmission point in one subframe and from another transmission point in the next subframe.

The architecture and radio parts of NSA are reminded in the Figure below.\n\nThe eNB is the master node (MN) while the en-gNB is the secondary node (SN).\n\nThe E-UTRAN uses the per-UE information supplied by the MME and local E-UTRAN configuration data to determine whether or not to use Dual Connectivity for that UE. On a per-EPS bearer (4G bearer) basis, the E-UTRAN decides whether to use a Master Cell Group bearer or a Secondary Cell Group bearer, and, whether or not that bearer is a split bearer, as defined in the section on the NSA Access Network.\n\nFor example, the Master eNB can decide to use the 5G en-gNB for user data (the \"Internet\" PDN connection), as to enjoy the 5G \"high capacity\" aspect, and to use the 4G eNB for IMS Signalling and IMS voice, as to enjoy the 4G \"robust coverage layer\" aspect.\n\nThe following figures illustrate some of the alternative configurations in the context of a Master Cell Group (MCG) and a Secondary Cell Group (SCG) respectively. Note that, as in the above example, one UE can use these configurations simultaneously. Also note that, in general, the EPC has no concrete information about whether the E-UTRAN is using Dual Connectivity, nor what configuration of Dual Connectivity is in use.\n\nNote that it is also possible to operate NSA with an unmodified pre-Release 15 EPC (4G CN). In order to support the SCG bearer, the EPC does however need to support the Release 12 Dual Connectivity feature.\n\nSeveral features have been introduced to enhance the functionality of the EPC for use with NR:\n\nWithin SA3, the security aspects were examined and CRs were generated that enabled the existing EPS security algorithms to be reused for signalling confidentiality and integrity protection, and, user plane confidentiality.",

(Refer to Amarisoft Home Page for the details).\n\nAlso, I think it shows an excellent examples of SDR advantage comparing to hardware/firmware based system. Currently, this solution has three differentflavors as shown below. As you see below, they might have implemented different flavors just by changing the hardware part (ADC/DAC hardware). Of course, it doesn't mean that you can just briing in any arbitrary hardware and connected to the radio stack PC as a plug and play. They might have invested some time and efforts to tweaking the radio baseband processing module so that it can seamlessly work with the hardware. However, this software tweaking would be much easier than redesigning hardware and redevelop\nthe firmware for the new hardware. This would be one of the biggest motivation for SDR.\n\nIn addition to the cost effectiveness gained by SDR, Amarisoft has an excellent advantage in terms of software architecture. It has MME and EPS and other Core Network components as a separate entity so that I can easily make an interface with other network components (e.g, interfacing with other EPS) and the overall architecture is very similar to real network (I think this is similar to\nOpenBTS architecture). So, this system can support all of test configuration as follows.\n\nCombining the flexibility of SDR Concept (basically it can work with any hardware capturing I/Q data) and core network software architecture of this solution (handling multiple UEs simultaneously), you can hook the system to RRH (Remote Radio Head) to act like live network (You can construct a complete private LTE network in this way)\n\nAmarisoft now provides UE simulator as well so that you can use it with Amarisoft Network Simulator for the test and initial development, or test your own network. See here for the details.\n\nEven though there is not much of technical details yet, since Feb 2019 the Amarisoft is capable of 5G/NR. See the press release here.\n\nFollowing demo from O3b would show one of the best example of using Amarisoft solution in real life testing.\n\nFollowing is the early implementation of Amarisoft eNB stack implemented on Ettus USRP, demonstrated by Ettus engineer.\n\nFollowings are the examples of using Amarisoft to show various aspects of LTE procedures.",

Tech.: Coding\n\nIn this page, I will go through Matlab/Octave functions for communication system within a context of a whole process but in step-by-step manner. You would have seen many other resources elsewhere explaining on these functions, but most of the material that I have seen was purely for showing the syntax of each functions. So it was very hard for me to understand practical meaning of those functions\nwithin a whole communication process.\n\n(With Reference to Lec 2 | MIT 6.450 Principles of Digital Communications I, Fall 2006 (YouTube) )\n\nIt is because \"We want to implement Efficient process\". What do you mean by \"Effiecient process\" ? It may roughly mean \"a process to send data using as less number of bits as possible\" and \"a process to be guaranteed to work\". All that the thick text book is trying to say is \"How we can make the efficient process ?\", \"How do you represent it in mathemaical form ?\", \"How do you prove (in mathemtical way) that it is efficient and always work?\"\n\nIn real work, most of engineers doesn't care about this. There are only handsful of persons who digest all those textbook issues and come out with 'what they think is efficient process' and produce 'technical specification (e.g, 3GPP)'. Around 99% of us just follows the specification. That's why we don't read the text book after we graduate from university and still can survive -:)\n\nThere would be a couple of variations of the definitions of Source Coding depending on the context. The first type of definition is 'to convert the original data(user data) into a certain binary sequence' which is illustrated as below.\n\n(With Reference to Lec 2 | MIT 6.450 Principles of Digital Communications I, Fall 2006 (YouTube) )\n\nAnother type of definition for source coding (according to Ref [2]) is to convert a source data into a form that can minimize the bandwidth that are required to transmit the data. Simply put, it is just another name for 'Data Compression'.\n\nAgain, It doesn't look that complicated. Then why the text book about this is so thick ?\n\nChannel Coding is a method to replace 'original data bits' with 'some other bits (normally longer than the original bits)'. For example, the simplest coding would be as follows :\n\nAnother example of coding would be addition of parity bits as in RS 232 communication\n\nIn communication system, we usually call 'the original data' as a 'message' and call the ecoded data as 'Codeword'. In all encoding process, the length of Codeword is greater than the length of 'message', in means that in coding process some additional bits are added to the original data(message) and this additional bits are called 'redundency bits'.\n\nMost of the experts in this area would come out with something like 'Shannon's theorem'.. but let's just look at this in intuitive way rather than bringing up such a scary words.\n\nLet's look at the simple wireless communication process that we went through in previous section. In this process, what do you think is the biggest problem ?\n\nThe answer is the 'noise' which is added by 'Channel'. As you can guess, this noise would make a lot of errors while the reciever is demodulate the received signal into the bit stream.\n\nWhich option do you prefer ? You would know that the first option would be almost impossible especially in wireless communication. If it is wired communication, at least you can make some try to reduce the noise in the channel but in wireless it is almost impossible to remove the noise directly from the channel.\n\nIt means the only option is to develop some method (algorithm) to detect and correct the error caused by the noisy channel. This is the main motivation for 'Coding'.\n\nMain idea of Coding is to add some additional bits (we call this as redundancy bits) to original data in a very special way (not in a random/arbitrary way) so that they can be used to detect the exact location of error and correct it.\n\nIn communication chain, following two blocks are added for this purpose. 'Encoding' is the process of adding redundancy bits and 'Decoding' is the process of extracting the error corrected bits from the received data.\n\nUsually Encoding/Decoding blocks locate as shown below. Encoding takes in the bits stream and produce coded bit stream.\n\nGetting in further detail, this encoding often happens in two steps called Source Coding and Channel Coding, but in this post I will just describe this process as a single step.\n\nIn previous section, I said \"Encoding/Decoding is mainly for detecting/correcting erros generated in communication process\". It is very good and important step. But once you gain something, you would lose some other things. It is almost nature of everything including our life.\n\nWhat is the gain for Encoding/Decoding ? It is the received data with less or almost no error.\n\nWhat is the loss ? What is downside of this process ? Following are the major issues caused by Encoding/Decoding process.\n\nAs I said earlier, Coding is adding some redundancy bits to original data and these redundancy bits will be used to detect and correct error in decoding process. There are many different Encoding/Decoding algorithms which has it's own advantage and disadvantages. So we would always have the following question when we implement Coding/Decoding Blocks.\n\nIn general, the more redundancy bits you add, you would have higher error detection/correction capability. But the more redudancy bit you add, the less throughput you would get because larger portions of transmitted bits should be allocated for the redundancy bits, not for the information that you want to send. So you have to carefully determine how many bits you would allocate for the redundancy\nbits.\n\nFortunately in most mobile communication system, somebody else has already determined the answer to these questions. For example, in LTE or WCDMA system.. 3GPP specification specifies all the details of Encoding/Decoding process and you don't have to worry about these questions.\n\nFor example, in LTE case, 3GPP 36.212 specifies the Coding algorithm and related parameters as shown below. Chapter 5 of the specification provides all the detailed parameters to implement the coding process.\n\nFrom now, I will introduce some of the basic functions in Matlab/Octave related to Encoding/Decoding. My goal is to extend this section to Turbo Coding/Convolution Coding which is most widely used in mobile communication system, but I am not sure by when I can achieve this goal. Let's just start with the simple things first.\n\nBlock Code is an encoding method in which we split the whole input data stream into small blocks and replace the small block (Message) with another small block(Codeword).\n\nThis process can be illustrated as shown below. The small block getting into the Encoding function is called a 'message' and the block getting out of the Encoding function is called 'Codeword'. We also express this process in a symbol (n,k). n is the number of bits for codeword(output) and k is the number of bits for message (input). n is always greater than k, meaning the length of output\n(Codeword) is always longer than the length of input(Message).\n\nOne example of block code is as shown below. In this example, we split the input data stream into 4 bit chunks and replace each of the chunks with 7 bit chunk. The mapping table between each possible 4 bit chunk(input = message) and 7 bit chunk(output = codeword) is shown below.\n\n'Linear' when you say 'Linear Coding' means a set of code in which any linear combination (modular 2 sum) of two codes within the set results in a code which also belong to the original set. Let's assume that you have a set of codes as follows. Take out any two codes from the set and take modular 2 sum of them. The result is also a member of the set as shown below. Take any other two\ncodes and try yourself.\n\n'Cyclic' is a set of code in which a code can be generated by cyclic shift of another code in the set. or in other word, any number of cyclic shift of a code in the set also fall within the set. For example, let's assume that we have a code set which is made up of following four codes. If you look into each of these codes, you would notice that any of these codes can be created by the cyclic shift of another code as illustrated below.\n\nTake the code (0 1 0 1 0 1) and cyclic shift right by one and it gives (1 0 1 0 1 0) which is also a member of the set.\n\nTake the code (0 1 0 1 0 1) and cyclic shift right by two and it gives (0 1 0 1 0 1) which is also a member of the set.\n\nIn short, in this set .. whatever code you take and however many times you do cyclic shift, the result is always within the original set.\n\nReally, Is it true ? Can I use any arbitrary mapping table as pops up in my mind now ?\n\nYes, you can. but it doesn't mean that what you created in arbitrary way would be 'efficient' mapping (coding).\n\nThen what would be the efficient coding ? There may be multiple answers to this, but some common answer would be\n\nOne of the way to perform coding is to use what is called 'Generator Function'. You might come across this term in any kind of materials related to 'Coding'. My first response when I first heard of this function was 'What the hell, is it ?'. Is it something like those functions that we learned in high school ? It looks similar to what we learned in high school days.. e.g, g(x) = x^4 + x^2\n+ 1, but the way they are used looks pretty different from high school.\n\nI would not try to give you answer to these question here.. you will get it as you proceed. What I am trying to say is \"Don't feel yourself as stupid if you have the same questions\" -:).\n\nGenerator Function is a kind of 'Binary Function' which can perform 'coding' (Convering a message to a codeword) in following manner.\n\nExpressing the equation in more detailed form, it can be expressed as shown below.\n\nThe best way to understand the real meaning of the equation above would be by example. Here goes one example.\n\nyou can pack these equations into a matrix as shown below. (Note that the lowest order comes leftmost).\n\nNow, let's figure out codeword for this message (figure out the output bit stream when this message go through the encoder block). This is the point where we use the generator function shown above. The process to calculate the codeword using the generator function is as shown below.\n\nFor practice, try all the messages shown in overview section and check if your calculation matches the codewords in the section.\n\nNow let's take a high level view of generator function (generator matrix) and see if there is any recognizable pattern. It is as shown below.\n\ni) The number of rows is same as the length of message (number of bits in message)\n\nii) The matrix contains the k x k Identity matrix, where k is the length of the message\n\nNow you would ask another again. How can I get these generator functions ? (How can I know which generator functions I have to use ?). Don't worry.. in most case these functions/matrix will be given to you from the specification of the communication system. (Of course, there is theoretical background that justifies those generator functions given by the specification and you can refer to\nCommunication Text Books or surf on internet for it. I would not get further into it). In think, just understanding the meaning of the generator functions and how to use them to implement 'encoder' block would be enough in most case.\n\nNow let's look into the codebook we generated from higher level. As shown below, you would notice that the codebook contains the message part as it is at the end and redundant bits at the beginning. This is one of the characteristics of what we call 'linear block coding'.\n\nIt is hard to cleary explain what is the convolutional code is, but you would get a rough image if you think about the 'convolution' that you learned in your engineering math.\n\nRepresenting the convolutional coding process is not simple and clearly explained in short space. So I created a separate page for this(See ConvolutionalCode page).\n\n[1] Lec 2 | MIT 6.450 Principles of Digital Communications I, Fall 2006 (YouTube) )\n\n[2] SIMULATION OF DIGITAL COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS USING MATLAB By Mathuranathan Viswanathan",

    "context": "3GPP-Specs#32240-f50#05\n\n4.1\tCharging mechanisms\n\n4.1.0\tGeneral\n\n3GPP networks provide functions that implement offline and/or online charging mechanisms on the domain (e.g. EPC), subsystem (e.g. IMS) and service (e.g. MMS) levels. In order to support these charging mechanisms, the network performs real-time monitoring of resource usage on the above three levels in order to detect the relevant chargeable events. The charging levels are further described in clause 5.3.\n\nIn offline charging, the resource usage is reported from the network to the BD after the resource usage has occurred. In online charging, a subscriber account, located in an OCS or CCS, is queried prior to granting permission to use the requested network resource(s).\n\nTypical examples of network resource usage are a voice call of certain duration, the transport of a certain volume of data, or the submission of a MM of a certain size. The network resource usage requests may be initiated by the UE (MO case) or by the network (MT case).\n\nOffline and online charging may be performed simultaneously and independently for the same chargeable event. Clause 5.5 provides further insight into potential utilisation of the charging information produced by the offline and online charging mechanisms.\n\n4.1.1\tOffline charging\n\nOffline charging is a process where charging information for network resource usage is collected concurrently with that resource usage. The charging information is then passed through a chain of logical charging functions that are further explained in clause 4.3.1 and clause 4.3.3. At the end of this process, CDR files are generated by the network, which are then transferred to the network operator's BD for the purpose of subscriber billing and/or inter-operator accounting (or additional functions, e.g. statistics, at the operator's discretion). The BD typically comprises post-processing systems such as the operator's billing system or billing mediation device.\n\nIn conclusion, offline charging is a mechanism where charging information does not affect, in real-time, the service rendered.\n\n4.1.2\tOnline charging\n\nOnline charging is a process where charging information for network resource usage is collected concurrently with that resource usage in the same fashion as in offline charging. However, authorization for the network resource usage must be obtained by the network prior to the actual resource usage to occur. This authorization is granted by the OCS or CCS upon request from the network.\n\nWhen receiving a network resource usage request, the network assembles the relevant charging information and generates a charging event towards the OCS or CCS in real-time. The OCS or CCS then returns an appropriate resource usage authorization. The resource usage authorization may be limited in its scope (e.g. volume of data or duration), therefore the authorization may have to be renewed from time to time as long as the user's network resource usage persists.\n\nNote that the charging information utilized in online charging is not necessarily identical to the charging information employed in offline charging.\n\nIn conclusion, online charging is a mechanism where charging information can affect, in real-time, the service rendered and therefore a direct interaction of the charging mechanism with the control of network resource usage is required.\n\n4.1.3\tConverged charging\n\nConverged charging is a process where online and offline charging are combined. The charging information is utilized by CCS in one converged charging service which offers charging with and without quota management, as well as charging information record generation.",

The operation mode is determed by eNB and informed to UE via RRC message and the level is determined by UE. Then you may ask how UE determine the level and inform it to eNB ? UE determined the level based on the reference signal power (RSRP) it measure and inform it to eNB by PRACH resource (frequency, time, preamble) it uses.\n\n[1] 4G, LTE-Advanced Pro and The Road to 5G by Erik Dahlman, Stefan Parkvall, Johan Skold\n\n[2] 3GPP TSG RAN WG1 Meeting #83 R1-156698 : MPDCCH for Paging at multiple CE Levels",

Even though the radio access and the core network signalling in principle supports up to 11 bearers, the UE capability was limited only to 8 data bearers. Since LTE Rel-8 operators have launched a number of new services, and it has become more and more evident that more than 8 radio bearers will be needed to support simultaneously all the services. Without this extension there can be risk of inconsistent end user service behaviour that will ultimately prevent adding further QoS based services for a UE. It also worth noting that LTE Rel-8 has a restriction of having 8 AM bearers or 5AM+3 UM data bearers, which limits further availability for emerging differentiated data services. As an example, there can be user cases and scenarios where up to 4 RLC AM might be needed.\n\nIn response to the aforementioned limitations, TSG RAN agreed to instantiate a new LTE Rel-15 WI aiming to remove those restrictions by increasing the number of supported data radio bearers.\n\nLTE Rel-8 functionality is limited to 8 data radio bearers, which was never revised in later releases. And even though radio access and the core network signalling supports in principle up to 11 data bearers, MAC header design has logical channel ID space only for 8 bearers.\n\nRAN WG2 decided to extend the MAC header logical channel ID space from 32 to 64 code points, which allows for not only extending the number of supported data radio bearers, but also introduces a possibility to add more MAC control elements in the future. After extensive discussions between RAN and SA WGs, it was concluded to extend the number of supported data radio bearers to 15 to minimize impact to the existing information elements on the NAS and CN signalling. It is also worth noting that extended number of LTE data radio bearers is also aligned with the 5G/NR technology, in which the minimum UE requirement is to support 16 data radio bearers.\n\nAs for RAN WG3, it has been concluded that radio access interfaces already can support up to 15 data radio bearers. In addition it, there also exist procedures to handle various error cases when e.g. one eNB does not support as many bearers as has been configured by the source eNB. As a summary, no changes were introduced in RAN WG3.\n\nFinally, it bears mentioning that even though this WI aimed at increasing the number of data radio bearers for LTE connected to EPC, same enhancements can be supported by a UE supporting LTE connected to 5GC, i.e. architecture options 5 and 7. In those deployment cases when both LTE and NR are connected to the same 5GC, it allows operator to deploy and use same services irrespective of the radio access technology that a UE is configured with.",

Tech.: Convolution\n\nAs you know, a most typical approach to almost any of the engineering field is to draw out a mathematical model for each component of a system and combine all of the mathematical components to describe the whole system.\n\nLet's assume that we built a mathematical model for each compoenent of a communication system as shown below. As you see, we have a mathematical model named as X which is the model for the signal from a transmitter. and we have another mathematical model named as Y which is for Recieved signal. and we have the model H which is for the channel.\n\nAs I described above, we have the mathematical model for each component of the system. Now the question is how do we combine these componend model to make it for the whole system ?\n\nPartly by intuition and partly by our common sense, we would guess that 'combining X and Y in some format' should produce Y. Then the next question is 'How to combine X and Y' ?\n\nThe first guess would be to try with basic operators like +,-,x,/. Let's think about basic property of these operation. My personal image of these operators are as shown below. Can you make any sense out of this ? Probably no. What I am trying to say with this illustration is \"one lement of Y is created by only one element of X and only one element of H\". Basically they are one\nto one operation. It means that a specific elements in Y is only influenced by only one specific elements in H and Y.\n\nAccording to research and experiments, the received signal is not calculated by this kind of one-to-one operation as described above. In reality, one element in X is influenced by many other elements in X and Y. If I express this in an illustration, it would be as shown below.\n\nYou might not haven't seen this kind of operation in high school math, but this kind of operation is very common to various engineering field and this would give you a lot of hard time at entering the university level engineering because you have never been familiar with this kind of operation in high school math.\n\nThe most commonly used operator which is operating like this is 'Convolution'. The convolution can be described as shown below. The symbol '*' represents 'Convolution'. (Don't get confused with multiplication symbol that you use in your computer software).\n\nFor further detailed description of Convolution, refer to Convolution section of Engineering Math.\n\nConvolution is a mathematical operator which gives the result when a sequence of a data goes through a specific process. Basically each elements of an output sequence is influenced by many previous element of input sequence and all the elements within the process the signal is going through. At the beginning, this would be very confusing cocept and just any of single explanation and\nlecture would never give you complete understanding for it. I am pretty sure that my explanation here would not give you the complete understanding if this is the first time for you to hear about 'Convolution', but if you have gone through many other resources before, i am pretty sure that my explanation would give you some additional insight and clarification. I stronly recomment you to try googling 'Convolution' and it would give you a lot of explanation with a little bit different aspects. You would find\nsome Java applets or animation showing the concept of Counvolution. Even in YouTube, you would get a lot of lectures about Convolution. Try all those materials as much as possible.\n\nEven though you have understandings of Convolution in mathematical sense, you would not have your own intuitive understandings of the concept without a lot of practice. Unlike the simple mathemtical operators like +,-,x,/ it would be very difficult to do practice about Convolution just by pen and paper since the calulation process is so complicated.\n\nTo help you with the practice, I would give you a short Matlab/Octave script. Try changing the vector x and chann and see how the outcome changes. Try to make your own association (relation) between input(x), chann and output(y).\n\nI strongly, strongly recommend you to try this on your own with pen and paper until you grasp the meaning of the process. (I posted the excel spreadsheet for this process. You can get it from here and try wth different values for f(n), g(n))\n\nWhen you complete this whole process, collect the values shown in red cell on right side and place it in a raw from left to right. That is the final result of convolution.\n\nIf you think you got the complete understanding of the process shown above. Try followings by your hand and see if your answer is correct.\n\nx = [0 1 0 1 0 1]; % Change this array if you want to change input sequence (transmitted data)\n\nchan = [0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0]; % Change this array if you want to change the characteristics of channel\n\nsubplot(2,5,3);stem(chan,'MarkerFaceColor',[0 0 1]);axis([1 length(chan) -1.5 1.5]);title(\"chan\");\n\nsubplot(2,5,8);stem(chan,'MarkerFaceColor',[0 0 1]);axis([1 length(chan) -1.5 1.5]);title(\"chan\");\n\nNow let's look at the first example. The input (tx signal) is a typtical rectangular pulse that you see in various electrical engineering books. The channel has 10 elements in it and only the first item is nonzero value 1 and all the other elements are set as '0'. Here the channel is a process which is manipulating the input sequence.\n\nLook at the output. The output(rx signal) is the result of convolution of input(tx signal) and chan. You see there is no difference at all between the input and output. It means the channel in this example is just passing through the input sequence without any modification.\n\nNow let's look at another example. The input (tx signal) is a typtical rectangular pulse that you see in various electrical engineering books. The channel has 10 elements in it and only the first item is nonzero value 0.5 and all the other elements are set as '0'. Here the channel is a process which is manipulating the input sequence.\n\nLook at the output. The output(rx signal) is the result of convolution of input(tx signal) and chan. You see there is no difference in terms of overall shape but the amplitude of output is half (0.5 times) of the input signal.\n\nLet's look at another example. The input (tx signal) is a typtical rectangular pulse that you see in various electrical engineering books. The channel has 10 elements in it and only the fifth is nonzero value 1 and all the other elements are set as '0'. This channel is almost same as the first example. The only difference is that the position for the non-zero value appears.\n\nLook at the output. The output(rx signal) is the result of convolution of input(tx signal) and chan. You see there is almost no difference between the input and output and the only difference is that there is some delay between the input and output. It means the channel in this example is just delaying the input sequence without changing anything in terms of amplitude.\n\nLet's look at another example. The input (tx signal) is a typtical rectangular pulse that you see in various electrical engineering books. The channel has 10 elements in it and only the fifth is nonzero value 0.5 and all the other elements are set as '0'. This channel is almost same as the first example. The only difference is that the position for the non-zero value appears.\n\nLook at the output. The output(rx signal) is the result of convolution of input(tx signal) and chan. Now you see two differences between the input and output. You would notice that both delay and amplitude has been changed. It means the channel in this example is just delaying the input sequence and changing the amplitude as well.\n\nsubplot(2,5,3);stem(chan,'MarkerFaceColor',[0 0 1]);axis([1 length(chan) -1.5 1.5]);title(\"chan\");\n\nsubplot(2,5,8);stem(chan,'MarkerFaceColor',[0 0 1]);axis([1 length(chan) -1.5 1.5]);title(\"chan\");\n\nsubplot(2,5,3);stem(chan,'MarkerFaceColor',[0 0 1]);axis([1 length(chan) -1.5 1.5]);title(\"chan\");\n\nsubplot(2,5,8);stem(chan,'MarkerFaceColor',[0 0 1]);axis([1 length(chan) -1.5 1.5]);title(\"chan\");\n\nsubplot(2,5,3);stem(chan,'MarkerFaceColor',[0 0 1]);axis([1 length(chan) -1.5 1.5]);title(\"chan\");\n\nsubplot(2,5,8);stem(chan,'MarkerFaceColor',[0 0 1]);axis([1 length(chan) -1.5 1.5]);title(\"chan\");\n\nNote : I posted a visual note in slideshow and animation format to show the concept of this example to give you more intuitive understanding.

You would notice that the values in channel is much more complex than the ones we saw in previous examples. And the result is as shown below. If you already have gone through any basic electronic course, you would notice that the output is very similar to the case where a rectangular\npulse is going through a capacitance circuit.\n\nLet me give you another example.

The Matlab/Octave code for these examples are listed below.\n\nx = [0 1 0 1 0 1]; % Change this array if you want to change input sequence (transmitted data)\n\nchan = [0 0 0 0 0 chan]; % Change this array if you want to change the characteristics of channel\n\nsubplot(2,5,3);stem(chan,'MarkerFaceColor',[0 0 1]);axis([1 length(chan) -1.5 1.5]);title(\"chan\");\n\nsubplot(2,5,8);stem(chan,'MarkerFaceColor',[0 0 1]);axis([1 length(chan) -1.5 1.5]);title(\"chan\");\n\nLet me give you an example. As you see, the input is the same as the ones we used in previous examples. You would notice that the values in channel is similar to previous example and the difference is that we have both positive and negative values alternating each ofther in channel sequence. And the result is as shown below. You see the ringing both at rising and falling phase.\nThis is a very similar case where a signal is going through a L-C circuit or typical transmission lines.\n\nLet me give you another example.

At most possible occasions for paging, no message arrives for the UE and the power the UE consumed could have been saved. This feature allows the eNB to send the UE a 'wake-up signal' (WUS) to instruct the UE that it has to monitor NPDCCH for paging, and otherwise allows the UE to skip the paging procedures. This allows the UE to potentially keep parts of its hardware switched off for more of the time, and save the power of decoding NPDCCH and NPDSCH for paging. Depending on how long the network allows for the UE to 'wake up' after receiving a WUS, the UE may be able to keep switched on only a receiver dedicated to WUS detection, allowing much of the UE's conventional hardware to remain in a very low-power state.\n\nScheduling request (FDD)\n\nIn Rel-13/14 NB-IoT, scheduling request (SR) exists only as a higher-layer procedure, which triggers a random access procedure to request sufficient UL resource to send a buffer status report (BSR). Rel-15 has added new, more resource and power efficient, ways to achieve this goal which can be configured by the eNB.\n\nFor a connected mode UE, eNB is able to configure by RRC periodic NPUSCH resources for the UE to send BSR, so the eNB is informed when pending traffic has arrived in the UE's buffer. The resources are activated and de-activated ('released') by dynamic signalling on NPDCCH.\n\nA connected mode UE is able to send, in the physical layer, a request to the eNB to be granted NPUSCH resources to send a BSR. This can be done either by a dedicated signal using a pre-configured NPRACH transmission, or via 'piggybacking' the request onto HARQ ACK or NACK transmission from the UE if one is available, by applying a cover code to the ACK or NACK symbols.\n\nEarly data transmission (FDD)\n\nAn idle mode UE is able to transmit data in Msg3 of the random access procedure, carrying between 328 and 1000 bits. After successful reception by eNB, the random access procedure terminates and the UE does not transition to connected mode. The UE requests a grant for EDT if its pending data is smaller than a maximum permitted size configured by eNB, by using a pre-configured set of NPRACH resources for its preamble transmission. The eNB can allow the UE to transmit a smaller amount of data than the maximum permitted size, in order to reduce the power spent transmitting padding bits.\n\nQuick release of RRC connection (FDD and TDD)\n\nA NB-IoT UE has to wait up to 10 seconds, after the receipt of the RRCConnectionRelease message, in case lower layers do not indicate successful acknowledgement of the reception. This feature allows that, in case the UE is not polled, the UE can consider the receipt of the RRCConnectionRelease message to be successfully acknowledged as soon as the UE has sent HARQ ACK. This feature was introduced from the Rel-14 specifications.\n\nRelaxed monitoring for cell reselection (FDD and TDD)\n\nThis feature allows much of the RRM monitoring to be avoided in cases where an NB-IoT UE is stationary and/or the network topology is not changing, and UE battery life can be correspondingly extended. The network configures the UE with a 'NRSRP delta' threshold, and while the change in RSRP its current cell is less than the threshold, the UE does not need to monitor neighbouring cells for 24 hours. This feature was introduced from the Rel-14 specifications.\n\nRLC UM (FDD and TDD)\n\nRel-15 adds support for RLC unacknowledged mode (UM) to complement the acknowledged mode (AM) and transparent mode (TM) introduced in Rel-13. This reduces the need to send RLC signalling over the air for IoT traffic which may be latency and/or loss tolerant, or recoverable by the application layer.\n\nNarrowband measurement accuracy improvement (FDD)\n\nThe narrowband secondary synchronization signal (NSSS) or, on the serving cell, transmissions of MIB-NB on the narrowband physical broadcast channel (NPBCH) can be used for making NRSRP measurements, as alternatives to using narrowband reference signals (NRS). NSSS and NPBCH use more resource elements for their transmission than NRS, and this should reduce the amount of subframes the UE needs to process to achieve a given measurement accuracy.\n\nNPRACH range enhancement (FDD)\n\nNB-IoT is sometimes deployed in cells with radius of up to around 100 km. Rel-13 NPRACH supports cell radii up to 40 km with unambiguous determination of UE range. Beyond that distance, because NPRACH is a pure sine wave transmission, there can be ambiguities for the eNB to determine the UE's range. A new NPRACH format is introduced with a subcarrier spacing of 1.25 kHz and a cyclic prefix of 800 μs, together with frequency hopping, which is sufficient to allow unambiguous range determination up to 120 km.\n\nSmall cell support (FDD and TDD)\n\neNB power classes are defined in NB-IoT to allow deployment of eNBs as microcells, picocells and femtocells, which use lower maximum transmit power than macro eNBs.\n\nReduced system acquisition time (FDD)\n\nIn FDD, when SIB1-NB is being transmitted with 16 repetitions (the maximum supported), eNB can transmit additional subframes containing SIB1-NB repetitions on anchor carriers and non-anchor carriers to allow faster decoding of SIB1-NB and reduce the UE's power consumption during cell access. Compared to Rel-13 which supports up to 8 SIB1-NB repetitions, Rel-15 allows 16 repetitions.\n\nUE differentiation (FDD and TDD)\n\nThe network is able to collect and store in the MME information about the UE and its traffic profile. This can be used to improve the scheduling of the UE according to e.g. its battery life or power supply, mobility, and when it tends to have traffic to transmit.\n\nAccess barring enhancement (FDD and TDD)\n\nIn Rel-13, the network can bar UEs at times of high load on a cell-specific basis. This feature allows UEs to be barred on a per-coverage level basis, so that UEs in deeper coverage levels and needing more repetitions of their transmissions, can be barred separately from other, less resource-intensive, UEs.\n\nMixed standalone operation (FDD)\n\nIn Rel-13, a standalone anchor or non-anchor NB-IoT carrier can only be configured together with another standalone carrier. This feature allows configuration of standalone anchor carriers with in-band and guard-band non-anchor carriers, and of in-band and guard-band anchor carriers with standalone non-anchor carriers. This allows small slices of non-LTE spectrum to be used as a standalone NB-IoT carrier and be linked with NB-IoT carriers associated to LTE spectrum.\n\nPower headroom reporting enhancement (FDD)\n\nIn Rel-13, power headroom reports (PHR) are made by the UE from one of two tables depending on coverage, each containing four entries. This feature improves the granularity of PHR transmitted in Msg3 to have 16 levels.\n\nTDD\n\nSupport for TDD is introduced, incorporating the Rel-13 NB-IoT feature together with Rel-14 features: UE category NB2, 2 UL/DL HARQ processes, multi-carrier RACH and paging, and OTDOA [1]. All LTE UL/DL subframe configurations are supported, except for configurations 0 and 6, and all LTE special subframe configurations are supported. In addition, some Rel-15 features described above are agnostic to FDD/TDD and thus can be used for both.",

The downlink E-HICH and E-RGCH are each further defined by a specific orthogonal signature sequence. Scrambling and channelization codes are specified in [4]. Time durations are defined by start and stop instants, measured in integer multiples of chips.

The user plane in the interworking here is not intended as an alternative path for control-plane signalling that would be needed between UE and NG-RAN for mechanisms such as A-GPS in a standalone control-plane solution.\n\nThis interworking does enable the SPC to retrieve measurements (e.g., GNSS-to-RAN time relations) from the NG-RAN.\n\nThe underlying architecture is shown in Figure A.2-1 (TS 23.501 [2]).

(This applies also for dual connectivity using E-UTRAN access.)\n\nAs mentioned in the summary for INOBEARRAN, the maximum number of EPS bearers has previously been limited to 8 since Rel-8 but it has become apparent that more than 8 radio bearers are needed to simultaneously support all the services that operators have been introducing.

In networks that are only partly upgraded, mobility procedures to target nodes that do not support 15 EPS bearers result in bearers being released based on existing error handling procedures. Bearers will also be released if a UE that supports 15 bearers moves to UTRAN or GERAN, as GPRS core network and Radio Access networks do not support 15 PDP contexts.\n\nTo minimize the impact of releasing bearers as a result of mobility to non-supporting target nodes the MME should be able to allocate EPS bearer IDs in such way that the bearers with higher operator preference will be preserved in case of mobility involving legacy target nodes.\n\nIt is necessary for all PDN GWs in a PLMN to support 15 EPS bearers, and MME's can be configured to take into account whether the HPLMN supports 15 EPS bearers when selecting a PDN GW for a supporting UE.

Does it mean 'emergency' ? or 'electronic' ? or something else ?\n\nEven though I haven't seen any formal documents that explicitely defines the letter 'e' in eCall, I think it would not be wrong if you say the 'e' mean 'emergency', i.e, 'eCall' would mean 'emergency Call'. But this interpretation would confuse a lot of people. Then, how does eCall differ from what we normally call 'Emergency Call (like 911)' ?\n\nI will explain on the details of this difference later, but simply put, the biggest difference would be the usual 'Emergency call' is a kind of voice call between a human and Emergency Call Center (usually another person in Emergency Call Center)' but 'eCall' is a call between a machine (called IVS : In Vehicle System within an automobile) and Emergency Center;.\n\nFor the persons who likes formal definition, I would quote some descriptions from a couple of international standards as follows :\n\neCall is a manually or automatically initiated emergency call, (TS12 : teleServiceCode 12) from a vehicle, supplemented with a minimum set of emergency related data (MSD), as defined under the EU Commission's eSafety initiative\n\neCall provides reliable full-duplex data communications between IVS and PSAP in addition to emergency voice call (E112) via the cellular network, and can be initiated either automatically or manually. The eCall In-band Modem uses the same voice channel as used for the emergency voice call. eCall allows reliable transmission of MSD alternating with a speech conversation through the existing voice communication paths in cellular mobile phone systems. The expected benefit is that emergency services will be made aware of accidents much more rapidly, will get precise information on location, vehicle type etc. and therefore will be able to reach accident victims faster, with the potential to save many lives annually.\n\nBefore we talk of the technical details of eCall, let's take a 10000-feet overview (high level view) on how eCall go through. You may find a lot of illustrations, cartoons on eCall from internet and following is my own version of illustration. I put the number labels on each of the steps and I would put a short descriptions on what's happening at each step.\n\n(2) eCall is triggered. eCall can be triggered in many ways. It can be triggered automatically by Air Bag or internal sensors. Or a person (e.g, driver) in the car can push the emergency button in the car to trigger the eCall.\n\n(3) The eCall device installed in the car (called IVS : In-Vehicle System) go through Emergency Voice Call setup process to establish the voice call channel. Once the voice call channel is established, the IVS send eCall Data (MSD : Minimal Set of Data) to PSAP (Public Safety Answering Point)\n\n(4) Once the eCall Data(MSD) is received by PSAP, the information would show up automatically on the screen at PSAP center.\n\n(5) The personnel at PSAP center may try voice contact to the person in the car if possible. But there would be many cases where this is not possible when person in the car is injured badly.\n\nFor those who came from Cellular protocol and new to eCall, it would be a little confusing on figuring out the difference between eCall and another type of Emergency Call (like 911 in North America) which we are familiar with in daily life. For those people, I think it would be easier / clearer to explain the difference in terms of overall protocol sequence. Following is my understanding (the image formed in my brain when I first got trained about this).\n\nAs you see here in the following illustration, there is common portions and different portions between eCall and Emergency Call.\n\nNOTE : IVS stands for In-Vehicle System. It is the eCall / Cellular module that are installed within Car (within Telematics module in most case). In terms of testing, this is a DUT\n\neCall Higher Layer Application Protocol (HLAP) is very simple (at least comparting to Cellular Protocol). Actually there is only one critical data to be transferred. The critical data is called MSD(Minimal Set of Data). All the remaining part is just to get MSD delivered to PSAP (Emergency Call Center) with reliability.\n\nAs in Cellular Voice Call, in HLAP there are two different type of call mode depending on who (IVS or PSAP) initiates call. The eCall initiated by IVS is called 'PUSH mode' and this is similar concept as MO(Mobile Originating) call in cellular voice call.\n\nThe eCall initiated by PSAP is called 'PULL mode' and this is similar concept as MT(Mobile Terminating) call in cellular voice call.\n\nThe two illustrations in this section is based on ETSI 103.428 Figure 2. The ETSI diagram is a single diagram showing both PUSH and PULL mode in single sequence. It looked a little confusing to me, so I split the digram into two separate diagram as shown below.\n\nNOTE 1 : IVS stands for In-Vehicle System. It is the eCall / Cellular module that are installed within Car (within Telematics module in most case). In terms of testing, this is a DUT\n\nNOTE 2 : PSAP stands for Public Safety Answering Point. This is a kind of Emergency Call Center.\n\nPSAP PUSH Mode Call is like MO call in celluar terminology. This is the call initiated by IVS (the mobile unit installed inside the car). I think in most case of eCall, the eCall goes in PUSH mode as illustrated below.\n\nPSAP PUSH Mode Call is like MT call in celluar terminology. This is the call initiated by PSAP (the call center). If you compare this with PUSH mode sequence, you would notice that most of the part are same. The only difference is the SEND-MSD (START) signal before the Initiation signal. This is also very much like cellular protocol. If you compare the MO Call and MT Call sequence in cellular protocol, you would notice that most part of the two are almost same. The main difference is that in MT Call the cellular network send 'Paging' (a kind of trigger for UE to initiate the call).\n\nAnother sequence that illustrate the eCall process with a little low layer point of view (especially in terms of LL/HL ACK operation) is shown below. This applies to both PUSH and PULL model.\n\n< ETSI TR 126.969 - Figure 1: Timeline of eCall with IVS initiated signalling and HL-ACK in normal operation >\n\nThere are various timers in eCall protocol which should be met in order to guarantee the normal functionality of the eCall. Some of these timers are an important criterial of testing eCall functionality.\n\nAs mentioned above, the only one fundamental goal for eCall is to deliver MSD(Minimal Set of Data) with reliability. Then you may ask what kind of information is in the MSD. High level description of the imformation in MSD can be find from following description. As you see, the most important information in the MSD is the location data and vehicle information.\n\nThe eCall modem allows to transfer a data message from the IVS over the cellular network to the PSAP which is denoted as eCall MSD. The MSD can include, e.g. vehicle location information, time stamp, number of passengers, Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), and other relevant accident information\n\nThe Minimum Set of Data forming the data component of an eCall sent from a vehicle to a Public Safety Answering Point or other designated emergency call centre. The MSD has a maximum size of 140 bytes and includes, for example, vehicle identity, location information and time-stamp.\n\nBefore we think of this, let's think of why we need to care of this. We should care of this because eCall signaling message and data are delivered in the form of Voice call data of GSM or WCDMA cellular network.\n\nIn GSM / WCDMA, various different types of codecs are used. Basically the codec selection is a job for the specific Radio Access Network equipment(RAN Equipment) that is communicating with the eCall device. The RAN Equipment (Network) would select the codec that would give the best performance in a specific situation. 'Performance' mean 'How fast the eCall data can be delivered' and 'How reliably it can be delivered under a specific channel condition'. It would be too much (or too boring) to present the full details on these performance here. If you are really interested in the details, refer to ETSI TR 126.969 and it would give you a lot of test data for various different Codecs.\n\nIn theory, you can use a live network and PSAP Simulator to test your eCall Device (IVS). But theory is just a theory. You would come across a lot of issues to overcome if you go for this option even though I cannot say it is impossible.\n\nAnother way of testing the eCall device is to construct test setup as described in ETSI 103.428 section 6 Test Configurations. In this document, it is described to use a private cellular network for various Interoperability and Conformance Testing.\n\nThe most practical solution (Test setup) that will be used in the industry would be to use Cellular Network Simulator and PSAP simulator as illustrated below.\n\nAssuming that you have a test setup and you need to determine what to test. As in most of other wireless and cellular device device, you may think of general test that tend to happen during the development or system integration stage. We often call these test in various different name such as function test, integration test or smoke test etc. Usually test specification / procedure tend not to be clearly defined or the procedure changes often depending on situations. Also those test procedure / test item may vary depending on manufacturer. Therefore, it would not be easy to clearly define on what to test for this stage. However, if you just take a close look at the overall eCall protocol, you would easily guess high level test items even without looking into any specification. My personal version of the guess work about the first level test are shown below. You may come up with different idea, but I don't think there would be any big difference between your idea and my idea.\n\nOnce you complete the general function test during development and system integration level and have a stable device, you would forward the device to conformance test. Once you are at the stage of conformance test, you don't have to worry about what to test because a lot of other people (standard body) put a lot of effort and energy and came out with well defined document. In 3GPP/ETSI, those test procedures are defined in ETSI TS 103.428.\n\nAfter completing the conformance, if you are trying to sell the device (acutually Automakers trying to sell cars) in a specific region (e.g, Europe, Asia, America etc), you may need to go through a specific set of test cases specified by the regulatory body in that specific region.\n\nFollowings are the examples of how eCall is being testing during the development or for conformance test before commercialization.\n\nFollowings are the list of the specifications for eCall. I think the most fundamental specifications are CEN documents. But it is not free to get those spec. Recently 3GPP / ETSI has released various specifications. I think most part of the 3GPP specification are based on CEN specification.\n\n: Describes mostly on physical/transport layer design and process of transmitter and reciever.\n\n: This documents describes on API and parameter descriptions of eCall modem protocol stack. It describes on overall software architecture and API prototype but not show the function body. Unless you are developing the protocol stack, you would not need to read this spec.\n\n: This documents describes general logics on eCall Test, but it does not specifies any specific test cases or details of protocol sequence. If you are interested in physical / transport layer level testing, this document would help you to catch the overall test concept.\n\n: If you are interested in high level protocol and function test, this document would help a lot. It shows overall protocol sequence of eCall and decfines specific test sequences. Most of the test in this document (as of V1.1.1 (2016-06)) are based on CEN EN 16062:2015\n\nRoad transport and traffic telematics eSafety eCall minimum set of data - Draft EN 081018\n\nIntelligent transport systems eSafety - Pan European eCall - Operating requirements",

Primarily, a SAND mode was defined in TS 26.247 [2] to support SAND for multiple network access (SAND4M). In addition, consistent support of hybrid MBMS services in TS 26.346 [3] was added, supporting also unicast-supplemented services. The interface/API between MBMS client and DASH client in TS 26.347 [4] was updated to add the SAND4M mode to the MBMS client and DASH client. The now outdated MBMS User Service Guidelines in TR 26.946 [5] are updated as well.\n\nFor the operation of the DASH client on top of an MBMS client, in particular for the case of MBMS Operation on Demand (MooD) and for MBMS/unicast service continuity, a need was identified to have API level communication between the MBMS client and the DASH client. Based on the 3GPP requirements, initially documented in TR 26.946 [5], MPEG initiated and completed the work on Server and Network Assisted DASH (SAND) in ISO/IEC 23009-5, which provides enablers for a consistent network assistance for DASH. With completion of the work in MPEG, the guidelines in TR26.946 are migrated to normative specification in 3GP-DASH in TS 26.247 [2] and TS 26.347 [4] to support of MBMS Operation on Demand (MooD) and for MBMS/unicast service continuity.\n\nIn addition, unicast-supplemented service offerings in MBMS, for which certain resources are only available on unicast and these resources provide an additional user experience, are added in addition to the already existing unicast fallback mode to support consistent support for these services. This for example permits to offer an MBMS service for which a second language is only available over unicast and therefore needs to be made available to the DASH client even if the DASH client is in broadcast coverage.\n\nIn order to provide a consistent support for the above features a SAND mode for multiple network support is defined in TS 26.247 [2] and the relevant enablers for the MBMS client and the interface between DASH client and the MBMS client are defined. In addition, consistent support of hybrid MBMS services in TS 26.346 [3] was added, supporting also unicast-supplemented services.\n\nReferences",

    "context": "6.1\tProcedure for Intra-MSC Handovers\n\nThe procedure for a successful External Intra-MSC handover is shown in figure 7. It is assumed that selection of a candidate MS has already taken place within the BSS based upon the criteria presented in clause 5. The exact algorithm, in the BSS, for determining a candidate MS is not addressed in the present document. The procedures discussed do not make use of the Mobile Application Part (MAP), represented by signalling function 4 in figure 2 and figure 3. The procedure described in this clause covers case i).\nThe successful operation of the procedure is as follows. When the BSS (BSS-A), currently supporting the MS, determines that the MS requires to be handed over it will send an AHANDOVER-REQUIRED message to the MSC (MSCA). The A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message shall contain a list of cells, or a single cell, to which the MS can be handed over. The list of cells shall be given in order of preference based upon operator determined criteria (These criteria are not addressed within the present document and are operator dependent). When the MSCA receives the A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message it shall begin the process of handing over the MS to a new BSS (BSS-B). (NOTE: BSS-A and BSS-B maybe the same BSS). The MSCA shall generate an A-HANDOVER-REQUEST message to the selected BSS (BSS-B). When BSS-B receives the AHANDOVER-REQUEST message it shall take the necessary action to allow the MS to access the radio resource of BSS-B, this is detailed in 3GPP TS 48.058 and in 3GPP TS 45.008. The switching of the radio resource through the necessary terrestrial resources is detailed in 3GPP TS 24.008 and 3GPP TS 48.008.\n\nOnce resource allocation has been completed by BSS-B it shall return an A-HANDOVER-REQUEST-ACK. to MSCA. When this message is received by MSCA it shall begin the process of instructing the MS to tune to a new dedicated radio resource. An A-HANDOVER-COMMAND will be sent by the MSCA to BSS-A. On receipt of the A-HANDOVER-COMMAND message BSS-A will send the radio interface message RI-HANDOVER-COMMAND, containing a Handover Reference number previously allocated by BSS-B, to the MS. The MS will then access the new radio resource using the Handover Reference number contained in the RI-HANDOVER-ACCESS message. The number will be checked by BSS-B to ensure it is as expected and the correct MS has been captured. If this is the correct MS then the BSS-B shall send an A-HANDOVER-DETECT to MSCA. When the MS is successfully communicating with the BSS-B a RI-HANDOVER-COMPLETE message will be sent by the MS to BSS-B. The BSS-B will then send an A-HANDOVER-COMPLETE message to MSCA.\n\nAfter MSCA has received the A-HANDOVER-COMPLETE message from BSS-B it shall begin to release the resources allocated on BSS-A. In figure 7 the resource is released by using the ACLEAR-COMMAND sequence.\nIn the case of ongoing GSM voice group calls the clearing of resources on BSS-A shall not be used if the resources are still be used on the down link.\nIf a failure occurs during the handover attempt, for example A-HANDOVER-FAILURE returned from BSS-A or BSS-B, then MSCA will terminate the handover to BSS-B. Under these conditions MSCA may optionally take one of a number of actions:\nThe exact action taken is dependent on whether the failure occurs before or after the A-HANDOVER-COMMAND has been sent.\nIn all cases the existing connection to the MS shall not be cleared except in the case of expiry of the timer for receipt of A-HANDOVER-COMPLETE.\n\nDuring the period that the MS is not in communication with the network MSCA shall queue all appropriate messages. All messages shall be delivered to the MS once communication is resumed . In the case of an Intra-MSC handover on MSCB then the messages shall be queued by MSCB.\nIn the case of ongoing GSM voice group calls if a failure occurs when handing over a user on a dedicated channel then the procedures described above may optionally be applied.\nFor the case of subsequent Inter-BSS Intra-MSC-B or Inter-BSS Intra-3G_MSC-B handover the following applies:\nIf handover to an A over IP capable BSS-B is performed, MSC-B/3G_MSC-B includes a Codec List (MSC preferred) in the A-HANDOVER-REQUEST message to BSS-B. MSC-B/3G_MSC-B may select the codecs for the Codec List (MSC preferred) from the channel type information and the AoIP-Supported Codecs List (Anchor), if this list was provided by MSC-A/3G_MSC-A in the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request. For a detailed description of the handling of these codec lists by MSC-A/3G_MSC-A and MSC-B/3G_MSC-B see 3GPP TS 23.153. If the AoIP-Supported Codecs List (Anchor) was not provided or MSCB/3G_MSC-B does not support the selection of codecs from the AoIP-Supported Codecs List (Anchor), then MSCB/3G_MSC-B shall create the Codec List (MSC preferred) using the channel type information received from MSCA/3G_MSC-A in the A-HANDOVER-REQUEST message included in the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request.\n\nAfter successful completion of the Intra-MSC-B handover or Intra-3G_MSC-B handover, if MSC-B/3G_MSC-B received the AoIP-Supported Codecs List (Anchor), MSC-B/3G_MSC-B may send the new AoIP-Selected Codec (Target) and AoIP-Available Codecs List (MAP) to MSC-A/3G_MSC-A in the MAP-PROCESS-ACCESS-SIGNALLING request transporting the AHANDOVER-PERFORMED message, if the following conditions are fulfilled: MSC-B/3G_MSC-B created a Codec List (MSC preferred) from the AoIP-Supported Codecs List (Anchor) received from MSC-A/3G_MSC-A, the target BSS-B uses A interface over IP and BSS-B does not insert a transcoder.",

There may be zero, one, or several uplink DPDCHs on each radio link.\n\nThe uplink DPCCH is used to carry control information generated at Layer 1. The Layer 1 control information consists of known pilot bits to support channel estimation for coherent detection, transmit power-control (TPC) commands, feedback information (FBI), and an optional transport-format combination indicator (TFCI). The transport-format combination indicator informs the receiver about the instantaneous transport format combination of the transport channels mapped to the simultaneously transmitted uplink DPDCH radio frame. There is one and only one uplink DPCCH on each radio link. The uplink DPCCH may also carry DL FET ACK/NACK signalling information for DL FET operation when DL_DCH_FET_Config = 1.\n\nThe uplink DPCCH2 is used to carry control information generated at Layer 1. The Layer 1 control information consists of known pilot bits to support channel estimation for coherent detection, and transmit power-control (TPC) commands. When DPCCH2 is configured there is one and only one uplink DPCCH2 for all radio links. When DPCCH2 is configured, the UE shall transmit DPCCH2 only in the slots in which DPCCH is transmitted.\n\nThe uplink S-DPCCH is used to carry control information generated at Layer 1. The Layer 1 control information consists of known pilot bits to support channel sounding and channel estimation for coherent detection. There is up to one uplink S-DPCCH on each radio link in the case that UL_CLTD_Enabled as defined in [5] is TRUE. Figure 1 shows the frame structure of the uplink DPDCH, the uplink DPCCH, the uplink DPCCH2 and the uplink S-DPCCH. Each radio frame of length 10 ms is split into 5 subframes, each of 3 slots, each of length Tslot = 2560 chips, corresponding to one power-control period. The DPDCH, DPCCH, S-DPCCH and DPCCH2 are always frame aligned with each other.\n\nThe parameter k in figure 1 determines the number of bits per uplink DPDCH slot. It is related to the spreading factor SF of the DPDCH as SF = 256/2k. The DPDCH spreading factor may range from 256 down to 4. The spreading factor of the uplink DPCCH, the uplink DPCCH2 and the uplink S-DPCCH is always equal to 256, i.e. there are 10 bits per uplink DPCCH/S-DPCCH/DPCCH2 slot.\n\nThe exact number of bits of the uplink DPDCH and the different uplink DPCCH fields (Npilot, NTFCI, NFBI, and NTPC) is given by table 1 and table 2. What slot format to use is configured by higher layers and can also be reconfigured by higher layers. The exact number of bits of the uplink S-DPCCH is given by table 2A.\n\nThe uplink DPCCH2 reuses slot format #1 of DPCCH, and the exact number of bits is given in table 2.\n\nThe channel bit and symbol rates given in table 1, table 2 and table 2A are the rates immediately before spreading. The pilot patterns are given in table 3 and table 4, the TPC bit pattern is given in table 5.\n\nThe FBI bits are used to support techniques requiring feedback from the UE to the UTRAN Access Point for operation of closed loop mode transmit diversity. The use of the FBI bits is described in detail in [5].\n\nThere are two types of uplink dedicated physical channels; those that include TFCI (e.g. for several simultaneous services) and those that do not include TFCI (e.g. for fixed-rate services). These types are reflected by the duplicated rows of table 2. It is the UTRAN that determines if a TFCI should be transmitted and it is mandatory for all UEs to support the use of TFCI in the uplink. The mapping of TFCI bits onto slots is described in [3].\n\nDPCCH slot format 5 is used when DL_DCH_FET_Config is configured by higher layers. In this case, over a 20ms Compression Interval (CI) consisting of 30 slots, the bits in the TFCI field carry TFCI information in the first 10 slots, and may carry an ACK/NACK indicator for DL FET in the remaining 20 slots. The ACK/NACK for DL FET is sent when DL_DCH_FET_Config = 1.\n\nIn compressed mode, DPCCH slot formats with TFCI fields are changed. There are two possible compressed slot formats for normal slot formats 0 and 2. They are labelled A and B and the selection between them is dependent on the number of slots that are transmitted in each frame in compressed mode. When DL_DCH_FET_Config is configured by higher layers, UL DPCCH slot format 5 is used in compressed mode. In compressed mode when UL_DCH_FET_Config is configured by higher layers, TFCI bits represent TFCI information in the first 10 slots that are not in compressed-mode gaps in a 20ms CI. The TFCI bits in subsequent slots that are not in the compressed mode gaps represent ACK/NACK indication for DL FET when DL_DCH_FET_Config = 1.\n\nIf UL_DTX_Active is TRUE (see [5]), the number of transmitted slots per radio frame may be less than the number shown in Table 2 and Table 2A.\n\nThe pilot bit pattern for S-DPCCH is the same as that for uplink DPCCH with Npilot = 8. The Nfixed bits in the S-DPCCH are fixed to \"10\".\n\nThe pilot bit pattern for DPCCH2 is the same as that for uplink DPCCH with Npilot = 8.\n\nThe pilot bit patterns are described in table 3 and table 4. The shadowed column part of pilot bit pattern is defined as FSW and FSWs can be used to confirm frame synchronization. (The value of the pilot bit pattern other than FSWs shall be \"1\".)\n\nThe relationship between the TPC bit pattern and transmitter power control command is presented in table 5.\n\nMulti-code operation is possible for the uplink dedicated physical channels. When multi-code transmission is used, several parallel DPDCH are transmitted using different channelization codes, see [4]. However, there is only one DPCCH per radio link, one DPCCH2 if DPCCH2 is configured and up to one S-DPCCH in the case that UL_CLTD_Enable is TRUE.\n\nA period of uplink DPCCH transmission prior to the start of the uplink DPDCH transmission (uplink DPCCH power control preamble) shall be used for initialisation of a DCH. The length of the power control preamble is a higher layer parameter, Npcp , signalled by the network [5]. The UL DPCCH shall take the same slot format in the power control preamble as afterwards, as given in table 2. When Npcp > 0 the pilot patterns of table 3 and table 4 shall be used. The timing of the power control preamble is described in [5], subclause 4.3.2.3. The TFCI field is filled with \"0\" bits.",

    "context": "https://www.sharetechnote.com/html/Handbook_LTE_BL_CE.html\n\nIoT: LTE-M1\n\nBL stands for Bandwidth reduced Low complexity and CE stands for Coverage Enhancement. In release 13, you would see many statements about BL UE/CE UE, but I took me quite a while to find out what they stands for :) (I found it in 36.300).\n\nIn many Whitepaper or articles, you might have seen the term like MTC, LTE-M1. But in formal 3GPP Technical Specification, you would noticed that these terminology (e.g, MTC, LTE-M1) is not clearly defined. In 3GPP TS, the term BL/CE is usually used to indicate the implementation of LTE-M1.\n\nIn short, LTE-M1 (BL/CE) is an design / implementation that is to meet the MTC criteria as shown below.\n\nHow is LTE M1 compatitle with legacy LTE ? Actually this can be a pretty fundamental question and help you a lot to understand about LTE M1 and Legay LTE comparison, but I asked this question to myself with more practical reason. When I started to reading LTE M1 3GPP specification (I think it was around Aug 2016), I was eager to try something myself just to understand the specification itself. (I am not such a genious to understand the details just by reading the documents. There has been almost nothing that I got a detailed understanding without hands-on). Of course, at that time there was no LTE M1 device that I could try with and I didn't have any LTE-M1 capable test equipment either. Fortunately, However, I had access to a couple of pretty good toys : a LTE network simulator with super detailed controllability and high performance vector signal analyzer with LTE analysis feature. So my idea was :\n\nAnd with some other reason, I thought I might tweak my super flexible LTE network simulator to act like LTE-M1 eNB at physical layer at least. But the hard reality that I realized was 'it SOUND very similar to legacy LTE, but not same. Not even at the level of similarity where the legacy LTE can be tweaked to emulate a small feature set of LTE-M1'. In short, followings LTE-M1 feature is same as legacy LTE.\n\nIt means if you have LTE-M1 device, you may test with the legacy LTE equipment to check if it can detect the cell and decode physical cell ID and check if it can come up with reasonal measurement of RSRP, RSRQ.\n\nHowever, the similarity ends here. All other things are not compatible with the legacy LTE even if they sound similar. Even for MIB (PBCH), LTE-M1 uses different resource element mapping from legacy LTE (See LTE-M1 PBCH). SIB1 decoding is not compatible either. LTE-M1 SIB1 scheduling is not determined by DCI. It is determined by a single parameter contained in MIB and a set of pretty complex predefined table. On top of it, the physical location of SIB1 hops among multiple locations (i.e, across the multiple narrowband index). See LTE-M1 SIB1 (i.e, SIB1-BR) page for the details. From here (from RACH), the differences diverges even further. The scheduling method is completely different and almost every transmission of PDSCH, PUSCH is being done in very specially designed repeating fashion.\n\nIn short, my final conclusion was to give up the attempt to try LTE-M1 by tweaking the legacy LTE protocol stack and decided to wait until I get a touch on real LTE-M1 device and LTE-M1 equipment. Now (as of Mar 2017) I got access to LTE-M1 test equipment and waiting to get a touch to LTE-M1 UE :)\n\nFollowings are list of the detailed topics. I am assuming that readers already have knowledge on how legacy LTE works and I will describe these topics with focus on the differences from the legacy LTE.",

There are two types of Secondary CCPCH: those that include TFCI and those that do not include TFCI. It is the UTRAN that determines if a TFCI should be transmitted, hence making it mandatory for all UEs to support the use of TFCI. The set of possible rates for the Secondary CCPCH is the same as for the downlink DPCH, see subclause 5.3.2. The frame structure of the Secondary CCPCH is shown in figure 17.\n\nThe parameter k in figure 17 determines the total number of bits per downlink Secondary CCPCH slot. It is related to the spreading factor SF of the physical channel as SF = 256/2k. The spreading factor range is from 256 down to 4.\n\nThe values for the number of bits per field are given in Table 18. The channel bit and symbol rates given in Table 18 are the rates immediately before spreading. The slot formats applicable to QPSK with pilot bits are not supported in this release. The pilot patterns for the slot formats applicable to QPSK are given in Table 19. DTX shall be used in the pilot field of the 16QAM slot formats, i.e. no pilot bits are used in this release. A BCH mapped to Secondary CCPCH uses the specific fixed Secondary CCPCH slot format in Table 18, and this slot format can only be used for carrying BCH.\n\nThe FACH and PCH can be mapped to the same or to separate Secondary CCPCHs. If FACH and PCH are mapped to the same Secondary CCPCH, they can be mapped to the same frame. A BCH mapped to Secondary CCPCH can only be mapped to a separate Secondary CCPCH without multiplexing with other transport channels. The main difference between a CCPCH and a downlink dedicated physical channel is that a CCPCH is not inner-loop power controlled. The main difference between the Primary and Secondary CCPCH is that the transport channel mapped to the Primary CCPCH (BCH) can only have a fixed predefined transport format combination, while the Secondary CCPCH supports multiple transport format combinations on the transport channels mapped to it and offers the possibility of using TFCI.\n\nNOTE 1: The slot formats 18 to 23 in Table 18 are only applicable for MBSFN operations with 16QAM.\n\nNOTE 2: The modulation used in MBSFN operations is signalled by higher layers.\n\nThe pilot symbol pattern described in Table 19 is not supported in this release. The shadowed part can be used as frame synchronization words. (The symbol pattern of pilot symbols other than the frame synchronization word shall be \"11\"). In Table 19, the transmission order is from left to right. (Each two-bit pair represents an I/Q pair of QPSK modulation.)\n\nFor slot formats using TFCI, the TFCI value in each radio frame corresponds to a certain transport format combination of the FACHs and/or PCHs currently in use. This correspondence is (re-)negotiated at each FACH/PCH addition / removal. The mapping of the TFCI bits onto slots is described in [3].",

This service component controls the transfer of the trace records from the NEFs to the OSF. The conceptual model is illustrated in figure 5, which employs both the event report function (CCITT X.734 [14]) and the log control function (CCITT X.735 [15]).\n\nThe trace control function collects traceable events within the NEF and formats them into trace records. These trace records may be stored locally within the NEF filestore or transferred to the OSF in the form of event reports. This is controlled by means of the \"priority\" indicator, which is a part of the trace type. If the \"priority\" indicator is not set then the trace records shall stored within the local filestore and subsequently transferred to the OSF in bulk via FTAM.\n\nIf a trace is activated with the \"priority\" indicator set then the trace records shall be sent to the OSF either direct by the trace control function or through Event Forwarding Discriminators (EFDs).\n\nIf EFDs are used then all trace records are offered to the EFDs. The EFDs determine which of the records are to be transmitted to the OSF in the form of event reports and the Operation System Id field in the header is ignored. The EDFs have complex filter constructs, which allow the operator to define the criteria for destinations and filters.\n\nIf EFDs are not used then all priority records are forwarded to the OSF whose address is given in the Operation System Id field. The NEF is required to supply additional information to provide the OS management application entity title.\n\nFinally, the trace records may also be stored in the form of log entries within the log of the NEF. It is up to the operator to decide if the log function is needed in parallel with the event reporting and file store. Once stored, the log records may be individually accessed by the OSF via the appropriate object management functions. Care should be taken of filter criteria for log records to avoid unnecessary overheads.\n\nThis service component contains the following groups of TMN management functions:\n\n9.2\tTransfer of Records\n\n9.2.1\tBulk record transfer\n\nThis group of TMN functions is concerned with the bulk transfer of trace records from the NEF record filestore to the OSF.\n\nThe trace records shall be transferred from the NEF to the OSF by the use of FTAM services. For further details of the use of FTAM see GSM 12.01 [8].\n\nIn addition to the simple file transfer services provided by FTAM, peertopeer application process communication may also be supported. The use of CMIS services for the uploading of files from the NEF to the OSF is specified in the GSM 12.00 [7].\n\nWhen the procedure defined in GSM 12.00 [7] and GSM 12.01 [8] are used to transfer the trace records, the file type shall be traceRecords and the format of the file is given by the type TraceFileFormat.\n\n9.2.2\tLog control\n\nThis function permits the trace record to be stored and retrieved from logs within the NEF. The logging of these records is performed in accordance with the log control function specified in CCITT X.735 [15] and no additional management functions are required.\n\n9.2.3\tLog access\n\nThis TMN function controls the access to the log described above. Each log defined may contain one or more log entries. Each log entry contains a single trace record.\n\nFor further details concerning the use of logs, see CCITT X.735 [15].\n\nThe following system management functions are required:\n\n9.2.4\tEvent Reporting\n\n9.2.4.1\tEvent Forwarding Discriminators\n\nFor shortterm recording of tracing events and for more complicated filter conditions the event forwarding discriminator construct defined in CCITT X.734 [14] and CCITT X.721 [13] can be employed. The event forwarding discriminator construct is extremely flexible permitting the combination of a number of fields and logical operations with a wide variety of scheduling options. The EFD also controls the destinations to which the event reports are sent. Several such filters may be defined and scheduled for operation at different times and for different time periods.\n\nThe following system management functions are required:\n\n9.2.4.2\tDirect Transfer by Trace Control Function\n\nThis function permits the NEF to transmit trace records direct to the OSF. In general the trace record shall be sent on completion of the call or the traceable event. This function is controlled by means of the \"priority\" indicator, which is contained in the trace type. If the priority indicator is not set, then the trace records shall be stored on file within the NE filestore. These records may be subsequently collected via bulk record transfer as described in subclause 9.2.1. If the trace type specified on activation includes the \"priority\" indicator then all of the records shall be sent via trace reports to the OSF specified by the operation system id.\n\nThe following system management functions are required:",

In this configuration, only the 4G services are supported, but enjoying the capacities offered by the 5G New Radio (lower latency, etc). The NSA is also known as \"E-UTRA-NR Dual Connectivity (EN-DC)\" or \"Architecture Option 3\". See also the clause on EDCE5.\n\n-\tthe \"Stand-Alone\" (SA) architecture, where the NR is connected to the 5G CN. Only in this configuration, the full set of 5G Phase 1 services are supported.\n\nThe NSA architecture is illustrated in the following figure.\n\nThe NSA architecture can be seen as a temporary step towards \"full 5G\" deployment, where the 5G Access Network is connected to the 4G Core Network. In the NSA architecture, the (5G) NR base station (logical node \"en-gNB\") connects to the (4G) LTE base station (logical node \"eNB\") via the X2 interface. The X2 interface was introduced prior to Release 15 to connect two eNBs. In Release 15, it also supports connecting an eNB and en-gNB as to provide NSA.\n\nThe NSA offers dual connectivity, via both the 4G AN (E-UTRA) and the 5G AN (NR). It is thus also called \"EN-DC\", for \"E-UTRAN and NR Dual Connectivity\".\n\nIn EN-DC, the 4G's eNB is the Master Node (MN) while the 5G's en-gNB is the Secondary Node (SN).\n\nThis is explained in detail on the dedicated section on NSA of this present document.\n\nThe SA architecture is illustrated in the following figure.\n\nThe SA architecture can be seen as the \"full 5G deployment\", not needing any part of a 4G network to operate.\n\nThe NR base station (logical node \"gNB\") connects with each other via the Xn interface, and the Access Network (called the \"NG-RAN for SA architecture\") connects to the 5GC network using the NG interface.\n\nThe continuation of this section refers to the SA architecture, the NSA being addressed in a subsequent, dedicated, section.",

The architecture and radio parts of NSA are reminded in the Figure below.\n\nThe eNB is the master node (MN) while the en-gNB is the secondary node (SN).\n\nThe E-UTRAN uses the per-UE information supplied by the MME and local E-UTRAN configuration data to determine whether or not to use Dual Connectivity for that UE. On a per-EPS bearer (4G bearer) basis, the E-UTRAN decides whether to use a Master Cell Group bearer or a Secondary Cell Group bearer, and, whether or not that bearer is a split bearer, as defined in the section on the NSA Access Network.\n\nFor example, the Master eNB can decide to use the 5G en-gNB for user data (the \"Internet\" PDN connection), as to enjoy the 5G \"high capacity\" aspect, and to use the 4G eNB for IMS Signalling and IMS voice, as to enjoy the 4G \"robust coverage layer\" aspect.\n\nThe following figures illustrate some of the alternative configurations in the context of a Master Cell Group (MCG) and a Secondary Cell Group (SCG) respectively. Note that, as in the above example, one UE can use these configurations simultaneously. Also note that, in general, the EPC has no concrete information about whether the E-UTRAN is using Dual Connectivity, nor what configuration of Dual Connectivity is in use.\n\nNote that it is also possible to operate NSA with an unmodified pre-Release 15 EPC (4G CN). In order to support the SCG bearer, the EPC does however need to support the Release 12 Dual Connectivity feature.\n\nSeveral features have been introduced to enhance the functionality of the EPC for use with NR:\n\nWithin SA3, the security aspects were examined and CRs were generated that enabled the existing EPS security algorithms to be reused for signalling confidentiality and integrity protection, and, user plane confidentiality.",

The group covered work on 2G and 3G radio capabilities, carrying on from 2G's roots in the original GSM pan-European digital mobile standard.\n\nWith 3G, the potential of a global market - for the equipment, handsets and for roaming - began to be achieved, as the standards community of Europe, China, Japan, Korea and North America united in 3GPP, from 1998. This highly successful project helped propel 2G evolution into 3G, and onwards towards fulfilling its promise to become the economic and technology success story of the 21st Century.\n\nTime marches on though, and although 2G and 3G are still in use today - it is time for the standards community to focus efforts on the new generations. As 4G evolves to 5G, we are safe in the knowledge that the GERAN and UTRAN standards, and the core network behind them are completely stable and can continue to be used for as long as there is a need.\n\nNote: update made July 9, to change title.

I don't think it is complicated because UMTS MAC is doing more things than LTE MAC. (In terms of functionalility, I think LTE MAC is doing more than UMTS MAC). I think most of the complexity of UMTS MAC structure come from the design and the complexity of the transport channel.\nOften, things get very confusing and as a result log analysis/troubleshooting gets very tricky. Followins are the topics that will be covered in this page.\n\nAs you see in 25.321 - Figure 4.2.4.1 (Overview on MAC Layer in UTRAN), regardless of whether it is for R99, HSDPA(R5), HSUPA(R6), HSPA+ (R7), every MAC data goes through MAC-d sublayer somewhere along it's path. However the data flow within this sublayer differs among R99, R5, R6, R7 and differs depending on whether it is uplink (From UE to UTRAN) or downlink (From UTRAN to UE).\n\nTo help you understand the path for each case, I colored the figure from 25.321 according to each of the case.\n\nRed path represent the case for R99 and it applies to both Uplink and downlink. But when you want to follow the uplink path, you have to read the figure from bottom to top and for downlink you have to read from top to bottom. The important thing to remember is that for R99 MAC-d is a whole of MAC layer and the MAC flow does not go through any further processing.\n\nBlue path indicate the path for HSDPA(R5) and HSPA+(R7). As you see, the data for HSDPA, HSPA+ goes through MAC-d with a very little processing and are passed to MAC-hs (HSDPA) or MAC-ehs(HSPA+) for further detailed processing. You will go back to this processing later in this section.\n\nGreen path shows the path for HSUPA, meaning this is an uplink path. You have to follow from bottom (from the point labeled 'from MAC-es/MAC-is) to top.\n\nAs you see in Figure 4.2.3.1 (Overview on MAC Layer in UE), regardless of whether it is for R99, HSDPA(R5), HSUPA(R6), HSPA+ (R7), every MAC data goes through MAC-d sublayer somewhere along it's path.

You will go back to this processing later in this section.\n\nThe MAC PDU for R99 (marked in Red path) has following structure. (Note that this PDU applies only to R99 MAC PDU and does not apply to HSDPA, USUPA PDU. ) This is a generic format which contains all the possible fields in the header, but depending on logical channels and mapping type, the header structure gets different. We will see the details for each specific cases in next section.\n\nThe purpose of this field is to indicate the logical channel type (class) and meaning and number of bits for this field differs depending on the logical channel type. (Refer to Table 9.2.1.1, 9.2.1.2, 9.2.1.4 for the details. These tables are all from 3GPP 25.321)\n\nThis field indicate UE ID type.

In this section, I will summarize the MAC PDU structures for all the possible combinations. These are based on 25.321 - 9.2.1 MAC PDU: Parameters of the MAC PDU header (not HS-DSCH or E-DCH) and MAC-d PDU header (HS-DSCH\nand E-DCH)\n\n- TCTF field, C/T field, UE-Id type field and UE-Id are included in the MAC header.

Operators have met this challenge by increasing capacity with new radio spectrum, adding multi-antenna techniques and implementing more efficient modulation and coding schemes.\n\nHowever, these measures alone are insufficient in the most crowded environments and at cell edges where performance can significantly degrade. Operators are also adding small cells and tightly-integrating these with their macro networks to spread traffic loads, widely maintain performance and service quality while reusing spectrum most efficiently.\n\nOne way to expand an existing macro-network, while maintaining it as a homogeneous network, is to \"densify\" it by adding more sectors per eNB or deploying more macro-eNBs. However, reducing the site-to-site distance in the macro-network can only be pursued to a certain extent because finding new macro-sites becomes increasingly difficult and can be expensive, especially in city centres. An alternative is to introduce small cells through the addition of low-power base stations (eNBs, HeNBs or Relay Nodes (RNs)) or Remote Radio Heads (RRH) to existing macro-eNBs. Site acquisition is easier and cheaper with this equipment which is also correspondingly smaller.\n\nSmall cells are primarily added to increase capacity in hot spots with high user demand and to fill in areas not covered by the macro network - both outdoors and indoors. They also improve network performance and service quality by offloading from the large macro-cells. The result is a heterogeneous network with large macro-cells in combination with small cells providing increased bitrates per unit area. See Figure 1.\n\nHeterogeneous network planning was already used in GSM. The large and small cells in GSM are separated through the use of different frequencies. This solution is still possible in LTE. However, LTE networks mainly use a frequency reuse of one to maximize utilization of the licensed bandwidth.\n\nIn heterogeneous networks the cells of different sizes are referred to as macro-, micro-, pico- and femto-cells; listed in order of decreasing base station power. The actual cell size depends not only on the eNB power but also on antenna position, as well as the location environment; e.g. rural or city, indoor or outdoor . The HeNB (Home eNB) was introduced in LTE Release 9 (R9). It is a low power eNB which is mainly used to provide indoor coverage, femto-cells, for Closed Subscriber Groups (CSG), for example, in office premises. See Figure 2.\n\nSpecific to HeNBs, is that they are privately owned and deployed without coordination with the macro-network. If the frequency used in the femto-cell is the same as the frequency used in the macro-cells, and the femto-cell is only used for CSG, then there is a risk of interference between the femto-cell and the surrounding network.\n\nThe Relay Node (RN) is another type of low-power base station added to the LTE R10 specifications. The RN is connected to a Donor eNB (DeNB) via the Un radio interface, which is based on the LTE Uu interface. See Figure 2. When the frequencies used on Uu and Un for the RN are the same, there is a risk of self interference in the RN. From the UE perspective the RN will act as an eNB, and from the DeNB's view the RN will be seen as a UE. As also mentioned, RRHs connected to an eNB via fibre can be used to provide small cell coverage.\n\nIntroducing a mix of cell sizes and generating a heterogeneous network adds to the complexity of network planning. In a network with a frequency reuse of one, the UE normally camps on the cell with the strongest received DL signal (SSDL), hence the border between two cells is located at the point where SSDL is the same in both cells. In homogeneous networks, this also typically coincides with the point of equal path loss for the UL (PLUL) in both cells. In a heterogeneous network, with high-power nodes in the large cells and low-power nodes in the small cells, the point of equal SSDL will not necessarily be the same as that of equal PLUL. See Figure 3.\n\nA major issue in heterogeneous network planning is to ensure that the small cells actually serve enough users. One way to do that is to increase the area served by the small cell, which can be done through the use of a positive cell selection offset to the SSDL of the small cell. This is called Cell Range Extension (CRE). See Figure 4.\n\nA negative effect of this is the increased interference on the DL experienced by the UE located in the CRE region and served by the base station in the small cell. This may impact the reception of the DL control channels in particular.\n\nA number of features added to the 3GPP LTE specification can be used to mitigate the above-mentioned interference problem in heterogeneous networks with small cells:\n\nICIC was introduced in R8. The eNBs can communicate using ICIC via the X2 interface to mitigate inter-cell interference for UEs at the cell edge. The X2AP message used for this is called \"Load Information\". See Figure 5. Through the \"Load Information\" message an eNB can inform neighbouring eNBs about: UL interference level per Physical Resource Block (PRB); UL PRBs that are allocated to cell edge UEs, and hence are sensitive to UL interference; and if DL Tx power is higher or lower than a set threshold value. The eNBs receiving these messages can use the received information to optimize scheduling for UEs at cell edges.\n\nICIC has evolved to better support heterogeneous network deployments -- especially interference control for DL control channels. Enhanced ICIC (eICIC) was introduced in LTE R10. The major change is the addition of time domain ICIC, realized through use of Almost Blank Subframes (ABS). ABS includes only control channels and cell-specific reference signals, no user data, and is transmitted with reduced power. When eICIC is used, the macro-eNB will transmit ABS according to a semi-static pattern. During these subframes, UEs at the edge, typically in the CRE region of small cells, can receive DL information, both control and user data. The macro-eNB will inform the eNB in the small cell about the ABS pattern. See Figure 6.\n\nICIC is evolved in LTE R11 to further enhanced ICIC (feICIC). The focus here is interference handling by the UE through inter-cell interference cancellation for control signals, enabling even further cell range extension.\n\neICIC and feICIC are especially important when Carrier Aggregation (CA) is not used.\n\nCarrier Aggregation (CA) is introduced in R10, with backward compatibility to R8, to increase the total bandwidth available to UEs and hence their maximum bitrates. When CA is used a number of R8 carriers, referred to as Component Carriers (CC), are aggregated and any CA-capable UE can be allocated resources on all CCs, while R8/R9 UEs can only be allocated resources on one CC. Cross-carrier scheduling is an important feature in heterogeneous networks. Using cross-carrier scheduling it is possible to map the Physical DL control channels (PDCCH) on different CCs in the large and small cells. See Figure 7. The PDCCH, carrying DL Control Information (DCI) with scheduling information, must be received by the UEs at the cell edge; PDCCH may be transmitted with higher power than the traffic channels. Hence, using different carriers for the PDCCH in the large and small cells reduces the risk of PDCCH interference.\n\nFrom LTE R11 onwards it is possible to handle CA with CCs requiring different timing advance (TA); for example, combining CCs from eNBs with CCs from RRHs. See Figure 8.\n\nOne way to ensure that a UE is using both the best DL and the best UL carrier in a heterogeneous network is to use CoMP, introduced in LTE R11. With CoMP a number of transmission/reception points (i.e. eNBs, RNs or RRHs) can be coordinated to provide service to a UE - for example, data can be transmitted at the same time in the same PRBs from more than one transmission point to one UE, or data can be received from one transmission point in one subframe and from another transmission point in the next subframe. CoMP can be used both in DL and UL. When CoMP is used in a heterogeneous network a number of macro-cells and small cells can be involved in data transmission to and from one UE. Especially useful in heterogeneous networks is the possibility for a UE in the cell range extension region to utilize the best UL in the small cell and the best DL in the macro-cell. See Figure 9. This, however, requires that the macro-eNB and the base station in the small cell are synchronized, and most likely it will require a combination of macro-eNB with RRHs in the small cell.\n\nFurther enhancements regarding heterogeneous network and small cells are coming in future 3GPP Releases. At the time of writing, Release 12 is still in the process of being formulated with some features in the study phase and others, such as work on interference management for neighbour TDD cells, dual connectivity between the macro cell and small cells, mobility planning within hyper-dense environments and advances in carrier aggregation combinations already in the normative phase (specifications).\n\nFuture updates to this paper will include what has been achieved with the completion of Release 12 during the second half of 2014.\n\n\"...Coordinating the low-power layer of small cells with the macro network improves performance across the entire network while also further boosting efficiencies in spectrum use and power consumption, automating network configuration and optimization. The upcoming 3GPP Release 12 (due to be frozen September 2014) standardises various capabilities in these developments including dual connectivity, small cell on/off and 256 QAM...\" ...Read the full article",

Does it mean 'emergency' ? or 'electronic' ? or something else ?\n\nEven though I haven't seen any formal documents that explicitely defines the letter 'e' in eCall, I think it would not be wrong if you say the 'e' mean 'emergency', i.e, 'eCall' would mean 'emergency Call'. But this interpretation would confuse a lot of people. Then, how does eCall differ from what we normally call 'Emergency Call (like 911)' ?\n\nI will explain on the details of this difference later, but simply put, the biggest difference would be the usual 'Emergency call' is a kind of voice call between a human and Emergency Call Center (usually another person in Emergency Call Center)' but 'eCall' is a call between a machine (called IVS : In Vehicle System within an automobile) and Emergency Center;.\n\nFor the persons who likes formal definition, I would quote some descriptions from a couple of international standards as follows :\n\neCall is a manually or automatically initiated emergency call, (TS12 : teleServiceCode 12) from a vehicle, supplemented with a minimum set of emergency related data (MSD), as defined under the EU Commission's eSafety initiative\n\neCall provides reliable full-duplex data communications between IVS and PSAP in addition to emergency voice call (E112) via the cellular network, and can be initiated either automatically or manually. The eCall In-band Modem uses the same voice channel as used for the emergency voice call. eCall allows reliable transmission of MSD alternating with a speech conversation through the existing voice communication paths in cellular mobile phone systems. The expected benefit is that emergency services will be made aware of accidents much more rapidly, will get precise information on location, vehicle type etc. and therefore will be able to reach accident victims faster, with the potential to save many lives annually.\n\nBefore we talk of the technical details of eCall, let's take a 10000-feet overview (high level view) on how eCall go through. You may find a lot of illustrations, cartoons on eCall from internet and following is my own version of illustration. I put the number labels on each of the steps and I would put a short descriptions on what's happening at each step.\n\n(2) eCall is triggered. eCall can be triggered in many ways. It can be triggered automatically by Air Bag or internal sensors. Or a person (e.g, driver) in the car can push the emergency button in the car to trigger the eCall.\n\n(3) The eCall device installed in the car (called IVS : In-Vehicle System) go through Emergency Voice Call setup process to establish the voice call channel. Once the voice call channel is established, the IVS send eCall Data (MSD : Minimal Set of Data) to PSAP (Public Safety Answering Point)\n\n(4) Once the eCall Data(MSD) is received by PSAP, the information would show up automatically on the screen at PSAP center.\n\n(5) The personnel at PSAP center may try voice contact to the person in the car if possible. But there would be many cases where this is not possible when person in the car is injured badly.\n\nFor those who came from Cellular protocol and new to eCall, it would be a little confusing on figuring out the difference between eCall and another type of Emergency Call (like 911 in North America) which we are familiar with in daily life. For those people, I think it would be easier / clearer to explain the difference in terms of overall protocol sequence. Following is my understanding (the image formed in my brain when I first got trained about this).\n\nAs you see here in the following illustration, there is common portions and different portions between eCall and Emergency Call.\n\nNOTE : IVS stands for In-Vehicle System. It is the eCall / Cellular module that are installed within Car (within Telematics module in most case). In terms of testing, this is a DUT\n\neCall Higher Layer Application Protocol (HLAP) is very simple (at least comparting to Cellular Protocol). Actually there is only one critical data to be transferred. The critical data is called MSD(Minimal Set of Data). All the remaining part is just to get MSD delivered to PSAP (Emergency Call Center) with reliability.\n\nAs in Cellular Voice Call, in HLAP there are two different type of call mode depending on who (IVS or PSAP) initiates call. The eCall initiated by IVS is called 'PUSH mode' and this is similar concept as MO(Mobile Originating) call in cellular voice call.\n\nThe eCall initiated by PSAP is called 'PULL mode' and this is similar concept as MT(Mobile Terminating) call in cellular voice call.\n\nThe two illustrations in this section is based on ETSI 103.428 Figure 2. The ETSI diagram is a single diagram showing both PUSH and PULL mode in single sequence. It looked a little confusing to me, so I split the digram into two separate diagram as shown below.\n\nNOTE 1 : IVS stands for In-Vehicle System. It is the eCall / Cellular module that are installed within Car (within Telematics module in most case). In terms of testing, this is a DUT\n\nNOTE 2 : PSAP stands for Public Safety Answering Point. This is a kind of Emergency Call Center.\n\nPSAP PUSH Mode Call is like MO call in celluar terminology. This is the call initiated by IVS (the mobile unit installed inside the car). I think in most case of eCall, the eCall goes in PUSH mode as illustrated below.\n\nPSAP PUSH Mode Call is like MT call in celluar terminology. This is the call initiated by PSAP (the call center). If you compare this with PUSH mode sequence, you would notice that most of the part are same. The only difference is the SEND-MSD (START) signal before the Initiation signal. This is also very much like cellular protocol. If you compare the MO Call and MT Call sequence in cellular protocol, you would notice that most part of the two are almost same. The main difference is that in MT Call the cellular network send 'Paging' (a kind of trigger for UE to initiate the call).\n\nAnother sequence that illustrate the eCall process with a little low layer point of view (especially in terms of LL/HL ACK operation) is shown below. This applies to both PUSH and PULL model.\n\n< ETSI TR 126.969 - Figure 1: Timeline of eCall with IVS initiated signalling and HL-ACK in normal operation >\n\nThere are various timers in eCall protocol which should be met in order to guarantee the normal functionality of the eCall. Some of these timers are an important criterial of testing eCall functionality.\n\nAs mentioned above, the only one fundamental goal for eCall is to deliver MSD(Minimal Set of Data) with reliability. Then you may ask what kind of information is in the MSD. High level description of the imformation in MSD can be find from following description. As you see, the most important information in the MSD is the location data and vehicle information.\n\nThe eCall modem allows to transfer a data message from the IVS over the cellular network to the PSAP which is denoted as eCall MSD. The MSD can include, e.g. vehicle location information, time stamp, number of passengers, Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), and other relevant accident information\n\nThe Minimum Set of Data forming the data component of an eCall sent from a vehicle to a Public Safety Answering Point or other designated emergency call centre. The MSD has a maximum size of 140 bytes and includes, for example, vehicle identity, location information and time-stamp.\n\nBefore we think of this, let's think of why we need to care of this. We should care of this because eCall signaling message and data are delivered in the form of Voice call data of GSM or WCDMA cellular network.\n\nIn GSM / WCDMA, various different types of codecs are used. Basically the codec selection is a job for the specific Radio Access Network equipment(RAN Equipment) that is communicating with the eCall device. The RAN Equipment (Network) would select the codec that would give the best performance in a specific situation. 'Performance' mean 'How fast the eCall data can be delivered' and 'How reliably it can be delivered under a specific channel condition'. It would be too much (or too boring) to present the full details on these performance here. If you are really interested in the details, refer to ETSI TR 126.969 and it would give you a lot of test data for various different Codecs.\n\nIn theory, you can use a live network and PSAP Simulator to test your eCall Device (IVS). But theory is just a theory. You would come across a lot of issues to overcome if you go for this option even though I cannot say it is impossible.\n\nAnother way of testing the eCall device is to construct test setup as described in ETSI 103.428 section 6 Test Configurations. In this document, it is described to use a private cellular network for various Interoperability and Conformance Testing.\n\nThe most practical solution (Test setup) that will be used in the industry would be to use Cellular Network Simulator and PSAP simulator as illustrated below.\n\nAssuming that you have a test setup and you need to determine what to test. As in most of other wireless and cellular device device, you may think of general test that tend to happen during the development or system integration stage. We often call these test in various different name such as function test, integration test or smoke test etc. Usually test specification / procedure tend not to be clearly defined or the procedure changes often depending on situations. Also those test procedure / test item may vary depending on manufacturer. Therefore, it would not be easy to clearly define on what to test for this stage. However, if you just take a close look at the overall eCall protocol, you would easily guess high level test items even without looking into any specification. My personal version of the guess work about the first level test are shown below. You may come up with different idea, but I don't think there would be any big difference between your idea and my idea.\n\nOnce you complete the general function test during development and system integration level and have a stable device, you would forward the device to conformance test. Once you are at the stage of conformance test, you don't have to worry about what to test because a lot of other people (standard body) put a lot of effort and energy and came out with well defined document. In 3GPP/ETSI, those test procedures are defined in ETSI TS 103.428.\n\nAfter completing the conformance, if you are trying to sell the device (acutually Automakers trying to sell cars) in a specific region (e.g, Europe, Asia, America etc), you may need to go through a specific set of test cases specified by the regulatory body in that specific region.\n\nFollowings are the examples of how eCall is being testing during the development or for conformance test before commercialization.\n\nFollowings are the list of the specifications for eCall. I think the most fundamental specifications are CEN documents. But it is not free to get those spec. Recently 3GPP / ETSI has released various specifications. I think most part of the 3GPP specification are based on CEN specification.\n\n: Describes mostly on physical/transport layer design and process of transmitter and reciever.\n\n: This documents describes on API and parameter descriptions of eCall modem protocol stack. It describes on overall software architecture and API prototype but not show the function body. Unless you are developing the protocol stack, you would not need to read this spec.\n\n: This documents describes general logics on eCall Test, but it does not specifies any specific test cases or details of protocol sequence. If you are interested in physical / transport layer level testing, this document would help you to catch the overall test concept.\n\n: If you are interested in high level protocol and function test, this document would help a lot. It shows overall protocol sequence of eCall and decfines specific test sequences. Most of the test in this document (as of V1.1.1 (2016-06)) are based on CEN EN 16062:2015\n\nRoad transport and traffic telematics eSafety eCall minimum set of data - Draft EN 081018\n\nIntelligent transport systems eSafety - Pan European eCall - Operating requirements",

    "context": "https://www.sharetechnote.com/html/WLAN_802_11ac.html\n\nWiFi: 802.11ac\n\nFollowing is the list of the main characteristics of 802.11ac. Most of these main characteristics would lead to some addition / modification of PLDC and MAC frame structure. These detailed changes will be summarized in each corresponding sections. If you are not familiar with WLAN frame structure and basic operations I would recommend you to go through WLAN Frame structure and WLAN protocol page first.\n\nAs in almost every evolution of every communication technology (except IoT), the major motivation of 802.11ac is to achieve much higher throughput than the previous highest throughput technology (802.11n in this case). I am pretty sure that you will see another technology targeted for even higher throughput than 802.11ac (We are already hearing of 802.11ad).\n\nThen what is the technical strategy to achieve this high throughput ? Overall strategy is also same as other technology (If you have seen the evolution process of celluar technology (e.g, WCDMA -> HSPA -> DC HSPA or LTE -> LTE MIMO -> Carrier Aggregation etc), you will easily understand the strategy. Some of the technologies for this evolution can be listed as follows\n\nWith the list in mind, if you try to correlate each of these technologies to each items of specification of 802.11ac, it will be much easier to get the big picture or motivation of those specification.\n\nJust to give you more practical insight on this motivation, I would compare 802.11n (the most advanced technology before 802.11ac) and 802.11ac with the respect t the features/technologies listed above. (NOTE : I got most of these information from Ref [13]. I would recommend you to read through this document at least once if you have time)\n\nNo new technology can be invented overnight. We all understand this. However, we don't want to wait forever until everything is ready all at once. A common practice in this case is to split those requirement/wishlist into multiple chunks and attack them chunk by chunk. In some technology, they call these chunk as 'Stage' (like Stage 1, Stage 2 etc) and in some technology they call them as 'Phase' (e.g, Phase 1, Phase 2 etc). In 802.11ac, they call them as Wave (e.g, Wave 1, Wave 2 etc). 802.11ac has been evolved as two Waves (at least as of now, Aug 2016) as listed below.\n\nIf you have a 802.11ac WLAN Card (device), the first thing you have to do is to figure out the Access Point (AP) around the device support 802.11ac. (Actually you don't need to figure out this, your WLAN device will figure out :).\n\nThen how your WLAN device will figure out whether the AP support 802.11ac or not ? It is by decoding the special information signal from the AP called Beacon. If your AP support 802.11ac, it will broadcast Beancon signal containing following information.\n\nFollowing Beacon Signal is the one from a WLAN Test equipment, Anritsu MT8862. Anritsu kindly provided me a full sample log starting from Beacon through user data and it will be a great resource for my study. I will sharing more as I learn more from the log. You can see the test setup on how this log is captured.\n\nIt may look simple two lines of information, but it will contain a lot of details of the 802.11ac capability that the AP supports. Following is the full decoded information.\n\n.... .... .... .... .... .... .... ..10 = Maximum MPDU Length: 11 454 (0x00000002)\n\n.... .... .... .... .... .... .... 00.. = Supported Channel Width Set: Neither 160MHz\n\n.... .... .... .... .... .... .0.. .... = Short GI for 160MHz and 80+80MHz: Not supported\n\n.... .... .... .... 000. .... .... .... = Compressed Steering Number of Beamformer Antennas\n\n.... .... .... .000 .... .... .... .... = Number of Sounding Dimensions: 1 (0x00000000)\n\n.... .... .0.. .... .... .... .... .... = +HTC-VHT Capable (VHT variant HT Control field):\n\n.... ..11 1... .... .... .... .... .... = Max A-MPDU Length: 1 048 575 (0x00000007)\n\n.... 00.. .... .... .... .... .... .... = VHT Link Adaptation: No Feedback (0x00000000)\n\n...0 .... .... .... .... .... .... .... = Rx Antenna Pattern Consistency: Not supported\n\n..0. .... .... .... .... .... .... .... = Tx Antenna Pattern Consistency: Not supported\n\n...0 0000 0000 0000 = Rx Highest Long GI Data Rate (in Mb/s, 0 = subfield not in use):\n\n...0 0000 0000 0000 = Tx Highest Long GI Data Rate (in Mb/s, 0 = subfield not in use):\n\nCommunication is the exchange of information between two or more parties. The previous section showed how the device can figure out the 802.11ac capability of AP. Then you would ask how the AP can figure out 802.11ac capability of the device. The AP can figure out the device capability from [Probe Request] message from the device as shown below.\n\n.... .... .... .... .... .... .... ..0. = Receive Staggered Sounding: Not supported\n\n.... .... .... .... .00. .... .... .... = Receiver can return explicit uncompressed\n\n...0 0... .... .... .... .... .... .... = Maximum number of space time streams for\n\n.... .... .... .... .... .... .... ..10 = Maximum MPDU Length: 11 454 (0x00000002)\n\n.... .... .... .... 010. .... .... .... = Compressed Steering Number of Beamformer\n\n.... .... .0.. .... .... .... .... .... = +HTC-VHT Capable (VHT variant HT Control\n\n.... ..11 1... .... .... .... .... .... = Max A-MPDU Length:1 048 575 (0x00000007)\n\n...1 .... .... .... .... .... .... .... = Rx Antenna Pattern Consistency:Supported\n\n..1. .... .... .... .... .... .... .... = Tx Antenna Pattern Consistency:Supported\n\nOne of the most important keywords in 802.11ac would VHT. VHT stands for Very High Throughput. You would not need any additional explanation on what this means. The meaning is obvious and self-explanatory.\n\nThe question is how to achieve VHT and what kind of new frames and protocols are introduced to implement this.\n\nIn wireshark log, you may see this framing information from Radiotap Header as shown below.\n\n802.11ac support various types of bandwidth combination like 20 Mhz, 80 Mhz, 160 Mhz. Then the question would 'how do they allocate the bandwidth ?'. Statically or Dynamically ?\n\nStatic allocation means that Transmitter (Initiator) and Reciever(Responder) negotiate and determines the bandwidth during early stage of connection setup and keep it same until the end of communication (a session).\n\nDynamic allocation means that Transmitter and Reciever SOMEHOW negotiate/determine the bandwidth in very short interval even during a single session.\n\n802.11ac picked up the dynamic allocation approach. It allows the change of the bandwidth at every transmission.\n\nThen the question is 'HOW ?'. What kind of negotiation they use to determine/agree upon the bandwidth between Transmitter and Reciever ?\n\nBasic Idea is simple. As you see in Data Transmission in Detail section, basic channel acquisition process for all 802.11 is based on RTS/CTS mechanism. 802.11ac use the same mechanism to determine the avaiable bandwidth dynamically. The idea is to split the whole possible 802.11ac band into multiple blocks of basic segments (e.g, 20 Mhz, 40 Mhz, 80 Mhz etc) and perform the multiple RTS/CTS simulateneously across the multiple frequency block. (It is very similary for Carrier Aggregation in LTE). First, the initiator sends multiple RTS accross the multiple frequency block and wait for CTS. If the initiator recieves CTS accross the all the blocks, it can use all the frequency blocks (very wide aggregated bandwidth). If the initiator recieves only a few CTS for the all transmitted RTS, it uses the smaller bandwidth for which CTS is recieved. (Refer to Ref [9] for the details).\n\nLet me give you a couple of examples with illustration on how Dynamic Bandwidth goes. Here goes only two cases but there can be much more variations on this.\n\nThis is the case where there is no interference between Node A(initiator) and Node B(recipient) and the full bandwith is avaiable for both nodes. Of course, these nodes does not know anything about the bandwidth availability before it completes step 3. Step 0 : Right before Step 1, it is assumed that Node A split the whole 80 Mhz section into 4 contiguous 20 Mhz block and performed carrier sensing for each of these 20 Mhz block. And it is assumed that all of these 20 Mhz block turned out to be available. Step 1 : Node A wait for a certain time period called DIFS(DCF Inter Frame Space), assuming that the scheduling is done in DCF. Step 2 : Node A transmit RTS for each of 20 Mhz block to Node B using 802.11a frame and it is assumed that all of these RTS reached Node B successfully. Step 3 : (Assuming that Node B detected RTS for all of 20 Mhz blocks) Node B transmit CTS using 802.11a frame for every 20 Mhz subblocks. Step 4 : (Assuming that Node A detected CTS for all of 20 Mhz blocks) Node A assumes that all 80Mhz BW is clear/no-interference and transmit the data in 802.11ac mode utilizing the full 80 Mhz. Step 5 : (Assuming that Node B received and decoded the whole data) Node B sends Ack for every 20 Mhz blocks (40 Mhz in total).\n\nThis is the case where there is some interference in some spectrum blocks within the 80 Mhz block on Node B(recipient). Of course, these nodes does not know anything about the bandwidth availability before it completes step 3. Step 0 : Right before Step 1, it is assumed that Node A split the whole 80 Mhz section into 4 contiguous 20 Mhz block and performed carrier sensing for each of these 20 Mhz block. And it is assumed that all of these 20 Mhz block turned out to be available. Step 1 : Node A wait for a certain time period called DIFS(DCF Inter Frame Space), assuming that the scheduling is done in DCF. Step 2 : Node A transmit RTS for each of 20 Mhz block to Node B using 802.11a frame. Step 3 : (In various reason, e.g, Node B failed to receive RTS due to interference or Medium is busy based on carrier sensing ) Node B transmit CTS using 802.11a frame for only two consecutive 20 Mhz blocks. Step 4 : (Assuming that Node A detected CTS for the two 20 Mhz blocks) Node A assumes that only 40Mhz BW is clear/no-interference and transmit the data in 802.11ac mode utilizing the 40 Mhz. Step 5 : (Assuming that Node B received and decoded the whole data) Node B sends Ack for the two 20 Mhz blocks (40 Mhz in total).\n\nIn 802.11ac, Following new Frame Types are added to the existing type. Most of New Frametype is for impelementing Channel Measurement and Report to perform MU-MIMO Beamforming.\n\nThis frame is used for BeamFormer (AP) to initiate Channel Measurement Process. (Refer to 802.11ac 8.3.1.20 VHT NDP Announcement frame format for the details)\n\nIt indicates the number of columns, Nc, in the Compressed Beamforming Feedback Matrix\n\nThis frame is used for BeamFormee (user) to report channel measurement result (Refer to 802.11ac 8.5.23.2 VHT Compressed Beamforming frame format for the details)\n\nTo perform proper beamforming for specific devices, it is crucial to figure out accurate channel condition between BeamFormer and BeanFormee. To figure out the channel condition, BeamFormer and BeamFormee performs a specific sequence of calibration process and this process is called Channel Measurement or Sounding process. It goes as follows.\n\nRefer to 802.11ac 9.31.5.2 Rules for VHT sounding protocol sequences, Figure 9-41a and Figure 9-41a for the details.\n\nNOTE : The fundamental purpose of this complicated process is to figure out the charateristics (nature) of radio channel between the Access Point and Devices. This is also called 'Channel Sounding'. During this process, no user data is conveyed. It means this process can be a kind of overhead (throughput degradation factor). If AP can best optimize the communication by extracting the most suitable BeamForming parameters from this process, this process can give a overall throughput gain. However, if AP failed to get the best BeamForming parameters from this process, this would just create unncessary overhead.\n\nMU-MIMO stands for Multi User MIMO and this is adopted only in 802.11ac (not in 802.11n and lower). When we say MIMO(Multi Input Multi Output), it normally mean SU-MIMO(Single User MIMO), which is a MIMO targeted to only one device(user). On the contrary, MU-MIMO is the MIMO targeted to multiple user simulateneously. It mean that in MU-MIMO the transmitter (Access Point) can transmite the multiple stream of data targeted to multiple user.\n\nIt sounds fancy, right ? However, the implementation of this technology would not be as easy as it sound and real performance would not be as good as expected. Probably it would need to go through a long way of evolution. Let's think of some of the challenges and possible issues related to MU-MIMO\n\nPutting aside the practical feasibility of this MU-MIMO, the specification is done. In most case of technology (even though it is not all the case), once the specification is issued the technology continues to evolve and get better and better.\n\n802.11ac MU-MIMO Beamforming is expressed in a mathematical expression as follows (this is based on 802.11ac 22.3.11 SU-MIMO and DL-MU-MIMO Beamforming)\n\nWhenever a new version of any technology comes out, one of the most concerning thing is compatibility. Can this new stuff work with all of those old stuffs out there already ? You would have the same questions about 802.11ac. Is 802.11ac compatitle with the existing (previous) techology (e.g, 802.11a and 802.11n) ? The answer is Yes. 802.11ac is designed from beginning to be compatible with 802.11a / n both for Access point and devices.\n\n[12] How to validate the WI-FI Information within Wireshark Part I: Determining the WLAN capabilities",

The base requirement was to provide at least the same security features as LTE.\n\nNon-Standalone NR Security\n\nThe NSA architecture uses LTE as the master radio access technology, while the new radio access technology (i.e. NR) serves as secondary radio access technology with User Equipment's (UEs) connected to both radios. Except for capability negotiation, security procedures for EN-DC basically follow the specifications for dual connectivity security for LTE. The WI summary for EDCE5 security (cf. corresponding clause above) provides details.\n\nEvolution of the trust model\n\nMoving on from the Non-Standalone deployment, in a Standalone 5G system, the trust model has evolved. Trust within the network is considered as decreasing the further one moves from the core. This has impact on decisions taken in 5G security design, thus we present the trust model in this section.\n\nThe trust model in the UE is reasonably simple: there are two trust domains, the tamper proof UICC on which the Universal Subscriber Identity Module (USIM) resides as trust anchor and the Mobile Equipment (ME). The ME and the USIM together form the UE.\n\nThe network side trust model for roaming and non-roaming cases are shown in the two following figures respectively, which shows the trust in multiple layers, like in an onion.\n\nThe Radio Access Network (RAN) is separated into distributed units (DU, or gNB-DU) and central units (CU, or gNB-CU) - DU and CU together form the gNB, as seen above. The DU does not have any access to customer communications as it may be deployed in unsupervised sites. The CU and Non-3GPP Inter Working Function (N3IWF - not shown in the figures), which terminates the Access Stratum (AS) security, will be deployed in sites with more restricted access.\n\nIn the Core Network, the Access Management Function (AMF) serves as termination point for Non-Access Stratum (NAS) security. Currently, i.e. in the 3GPP 5G Phase 1 specification, the AMF is collocated with the SEcurity Anchor Function (SEAF) that holds the root key (known as anchor key) for the visited network. The security architecture is defined in a future proof fashion, as it allows separation of the security anchor from the mobility function that could be possible in a future evolution of the system architecture.\n\nThe AUthentication Function (AUSF) keeps a key for reuse, derived after authentication, in case of simultaneous registration of a UE in different access network technologies, i.e. 3GPP access networks and non-3GPP access networks such as IEEE 802.11 Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN). Authentication credential Repository and Processing Function (ARPF) keeps the authentication credentials. This is mirrored by the USIM on the side of the client, i.e. the UE side. The subscriber information is stored in the Unified Data Repository (UDR). The Unified Data Management (UDM) uses the subscription data stored in UDR and implements the application logic to perform various functionalities such as authentication credential generation, user identification, service and session continuity etc. Over the air interface, both active and passive attacks are considered on both control plane and user plane. Privacy has become increasingly important leading to permanent identifiers being kept secret over the air interface.\n\nIn the roaming architecture, the home and the visited network are connected through SEcurity Protection Proxy (SEPP) for the control plane of the internetwork interconnect. This enhancement is done in 5G because of the number of attacks coming to light recently such as key theft and re-routing attacks in SS7 and network node impersonation and source address spoofing in signalling messages in DIAMETER that exploited the trusted nature of the internetwork interconnect.\n\n5G Phase 1 Security (Release 15)\n\n5G Phase 1 brings several enhancements to LTE security, some of the key points are presented in this section. Details of 5G Phase 1 security can be found in TS 33.501 [1].\n\nPrimary authentication: Network and device mutual authentication in 5G is based on primary authentication. This is similar to LTE but there are a few differences. The authentication mechanism has in-built home control allowing the home operator to know whether the device is authenticated in a given network and to take final call of authentication. In 5G Phase 1 there are two mandatory authentication options: 5G Authentication and Key Agreement (5G-AKA) and Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)-AKA', i.e. EAP-AKA'. Optionally, other EAP based authentication mechanisms are also allowed in 5G - for specific cases such as private networks. Also, primary authentication is radio access technology independent, thus it can run over non-3GPP technology such as IEEE 802.11 WLANs.\n\nSecondary authentication: Secondary authentication in 5G is meant for authentication with data networks outside the mobile operator domain. For this purpose, different EAP based authentication methods and associated credentials can be used. A similar service was possible in LTE as well, but now it is integrated in the 5G architecture.\n\nInter-operator security: Several security issues exist in the inter-operator interface arising from SS7 or Diameter [5,6] in the earlier generations of mobile communication systems. To counter these issues, 5G Phase 1 provides inter-operator security from the very beginning.\n\nPrivacy: Subscriber identity related issues have been known since LTE and earlier generations of mobile systems. In 5G a privacy solution is developed that protects the user's subscription permanent identifier against active attacks. A home network public key is used to provide subscriber identity privacy.\n\nService based architecture (SBA): The 5G core network is based on a service based architecture, which did not exist in LTE and earlier generations. Thus 5G also provides adequate security for SBA.\n\nCentral Unit (CU) - Distributed Unit (DU): In 5G the base-station is logically split in CU and DU with an interface (the F1) between them. Security is provided for the CU-DU interface. This split was also possible in LTE, but in 5G it is part of the architecture that can support a number of deployment options (e.g. co-located CU-DU deployment is also possible). The DUs, which are deployed at the very edge of the network, don't have access to any user data when confidentiality protection is enabled. Even with the CU-DU split, the air interface security point in 5G remains the same as in LTE, namely in the radio access network.\n\nKey hierarchy: The 5G hierarchy reflects the changes in the overall architecture and the trust model using the security principle of key separation. One main difference in 5G compared to LTE is the possibility for integrity protection of the user plane.\n\nMobility: Although mobility in 5G is similar to LTE, the difference in 5G is the assumption that the mobility anchor in the core network can be separated from the security anchor.\n\nReferences",

The CTF determines whether the request corresponds to an user / network event (event based charging, e.g. MMS) or whether a session shall be started (session based charging, e.g. IP CAN bearer). Generally, this property is built into the network capability, or service, that the NE provides, and described in the middle tier TSs.\n\nNote that TS 23.078 [207] also specifies online charging capability in the SGSN and MSC based on CAMEL, i.e. using the CAP reference point towards the OCS. This functionality is outside the scope of the present document.\n\nIn event based charging, a network / user event (e.g. MM submission) corresponds to a single chargeable event. In session based charging, at least two chargeable events are needed, one each to describe the start and the end of the session, respectively. Multiple interim events are possible in order to describe changes of session characteristics (e.g. change of IP CAN bearer QoS or change of IMS session media types), or when certain limits, e.g. time or volume, are exceeded. The CTF transforms each chargeable event into a charging event and forwards these charging events to the OCF in real-time.\n\nFor event based charging, the Credit-Control procedure in the OCS may or may not involve reservation of units from the subscriber account, as described in clause 5.1. In the case of event based charging without reservation (IEC):\n\nThe following exceptions and abnormal cases are defined for the IEC scenario:\n\nIf the Credit-Control procedure does involve reservation (ECUR):\n\nThe following exceptions and abnormal cases are defined for the ECUR scenario:\n\nSession based online charging always involves reservation within the Credit-Control procedure (SCUR), as there is no way for the OCS to predict the amount of resource usage that occurs during the user session. To begin with, the CTF forward generates a charging chargeable event that corresponds to the resource usage request and maps onto the user session, and forwards it to the OCF. In the OCS, the online charging session is started and a certain amount reserved from the user subscriber account. This amount is determined by the OCS based on the information in the charging event and on local configuration, i.e. operator policy. A resource usage quota, matching the reserved amount, is then returned by the OCS, at which point the user session starts in the NE. Further charging events are sent from the NE to the OCS upon the detection of further chargeable events within the session .e.g. the expiry of in intervals configured on the NE or instructed by the OCS, or when the authorised quota expires, or when session characteristics change (e.g. change of QoS of an IP CAN bearer). The OCS then furnishes a new quota to the NE as required, or rejects the charging event, e.g. due to expiry of credit on the subscriber account. The OCS also furnishes the NE's behaviour on quota expiry (termination action). When the user session terminates normally in the NE, a final statement on the actually used network resources is returned to the OCS, enabling the OCS to calculate the final value of the actual resource usage session and to properly debit the corresponding final amount from the subscriber account (possibly resulting in a re-crediting of previously reserved amounts). This also terminates the Credit-Control session for the particular user session. The following exceptions and abnormal cases are defined for the SCUR scenario:\n\nIn any of the above cases, the termination of the user session coincides with the termination of the Credit-Control session, e.g. even when a user session is allowed to continue upon account expiry, the Credit-Control session will also continue, but \"zero\" rated.\n\nIt is important for operators to carefully consider the reservation policy on the OCS. On the one hand, if small amounts are reserved, the NE must renew the authorisation very frequently, creating high signalling and processing loads. Additionally, this policy has a comparatively high likelihood of longer, or higher-value, user sessions being forcefully terminated due to expiry of the subscriber account after many small quotas have been used for small chunks of the subscriber session. In contrast, assigning high reservations avoids the above problems, but may interdict the user from the execution of additional, parallel resource usages: due to the high previous reservation, there is no credit left on the account for another resource usage request. The situation described in this paragraph is particularly complex when correlation between multiple charging levels is necessary, see clause 5.3.4. A potential method of relieving this problem is the pooling of credit quotas as described in clause 5.5.2 below.\n\nThe middle tier TSs specify the chargeable events and the content of the associated charging events and responses. TS 32.299 [50] specifies the interface application for the Ro reference point, including the message types and the domain / subsystem / service independent contents of the messages. In addition to the Credit-Control functions, the OCS may also be capable of producing CDRs based on the execution of the above Credit-Control procedures. To this end, the OCS must implement a CDF, and it uses the Ga and Bo reference points to forward its CDRs to a CGF and the CDR files to the BD. These functions of the OCS, however, are outside the scope of 3GPP standardisation.",

Tech.: Coding\n\nIn this page, I will go through Matlab/Octave functions for communication system within a context of a whole process but in step-by-step manner. You would have seen many other resources elsewhere explaining on these functions, but most of the material that I have seen was purely for showing the syntax of each functions. So it was very hard for me to understand practical meaning of those functions\nwithin a whole communication process.\n\n(With Reference to Lec 2 | MIT 6.450 Principles of Digital Communications I, Fall 2006 (YouTube) )\n\nIt is because \"We want to implement Efficient process\". What do you mean by \"Effiecient process\" ? It may roughly mean \"a process to send data using as less number of bits as possible\" and \"a process to be guaranteed to work\". All that the thick text book is trying to say is \"How we can make the efficient process ?\", \"How do you represent it in mathemaical form ?\", \"How do you prove (in mathemtical way) that it is efficient and always work?\"\n\nIn real work, most of engineers doesn't care about this. There are only handsful of persons who digest all those textbook issues and come out with 'what they think is efficient process' and produce 'technical specification (e.g, 3GPP)'. Around 99% of us just follows the specification. That's why we don't read the text book after we graduate from university and still can survive -:)\n\nThere would be a couple of variations of the definitions of Source Coding depending on the context. The first type of definition is 'to convert the original data(user data) into a certain binary sequence' which is illustrated as below.\n\n(With Reference to Lec 2 | MIT 6.450 Principles of Digital Communications I, Fall 2006 (YouTube) )\n\nAnother type of definition for source coding (according to Ref [2]) is to convert a source data into a form that can minimize the bandwidth that are required to transmit the data. Simply put, it is just another name for 'Data Compression'.\n\nAgain, It doesn't look that complicated. Then why the text book about this is so thick ?\n\nChannel Coding is a method to replace 'original data bits' with 'some other bits (normally longer than the original bits)'. For example, the simplest coding would be as follows :\n\nAnother example of coding would be addition of parity bits as in RS 232 communication\n\nIn communication system, we usually call 'the original data' as a 'message' and call the ecoded data as 'Codeword'. In all encoding process, the length of Codeword is greater than the length of 'message', in means that in coding process some additional bits are added to the original data(message) and this additional bits are called 'redundency bits'.\n\nMost of the experts in this area would come out with something like 'Shannon's theorem'.. but let's just look at this in intuitive way rather than bringing up such a scary words.\n\nLet's look at the simple wireless communication process that we went through in previous section. In this process, what do you think is the biggest problem ?\n\nThe answer is the 'noise' which is added by 'Channel'. As you can guess, this noise would make a lot of errors while the reciever is demodulate the received signal into the bit stream.\n\nWhich option do you prefer ? You would know that the first option would be almost impossible especially in wireless communication. If it is wired communication, at least you can make some try to reduce the noise in the channel but in wireless it is almost impossible to remove the noise directly from the channel.\n\nIt means the only option is to develop some method (algorithm) to detect and correct the error caused by the noisy channel. This is the main motivation for 'Coding'.\n\nMain idea of Coding is to add some additional bits (we call this as redundancy bits) to original data in a very special way (not in a random/arbitrary way) so that they can be used to detect the exact location of error and correct it.\n\nIn communication chain, following two blocks are added for this purpose. 'Encoding' is the process of adding redundancy bits and 'Decoding' is the process of extracting the error corrected bits from the received data.\n\nUsually Encoding/Decoding blocks locate as shown below. Encoding takes in the bits stream and produce coded bit stream.\n\nGetting in further detail, this encoding often happens in two steps called Source Coding and Channel Coding, but in this post I will just describe this process as a single step.\n\nIn previous section, I said \"Encoding/Decoding is mainly for detecting/correcting erros generated in communication process\". It is very good and important step. But once you gain something, you would lose some other things. It is almost nature of everything including our life.\n\nWhat is the gain for Encoding/Decoding ? It is the received data with less or almost no error.\n\nWhat is the loss ? What is downside of this process ? Following are the major issues caused by Encoding/Decoding process.\n\nAs I said earlier, Coding is adding some redundancy bits to original data and these redundancy bits will be used to detect and correct error in decoding process. There are many different Encoding/Decoding algorithms which has it's own advantage and disadvantages. So we would always have the following question when we implement Coding/Decoding Blocks.\n\nIn general, the more redundancy bits you add, you would have higher error detection/correction capability. But the more redudancy bit you add, the less throughput you would get because larger portions of transmitted bits should be allocated for the redundancy bits, not for the information that you want to send. So you have to carefully determine how many bits you would allocate for the redundancy\nbits.\n\nFortunately in most mobile communication system, somebody else has already determined the answer to these questions. For example, in LTE or WCDMA system.. 3GPP specification specifies all the details of Encoding/Decoding process and you don't have to worry about these questions.\n\nFor example, in LTE case, 3GPP 36.212 specifies the Coding algorithm and related parameters as shown below. Chapter 5 of the specification provides all the detailed parameters to implement the coding process.\n\nFrom now, I will introduce some of the basic functions in Matlab/Octave related to Encoding/Decoding. My goal is to extend this section to Turbo Coding/Convolution Coding which is most widely used in mobile communication system, but I am not sure by when I can achieve this goal. Let's just start with the simple things first.\n\nBlock Code is an encoding method in which we split the whole input data stream into small blocks and replace the small block (Message) with another small block(Codeword).\n\nThis process can be illustrated as shown below. The small block getting into the Encoding function is called a 'message' and the block getting out of the Encoding function is called 'Codeword'. We also express this process in a symbol (n,k). n is the number of bits for codeword(output) and k is the number of bits for message (input). n is always greater than k, meaning the length of output\n(Codeword) is always longer than the length of input(Message).\n\nOne example of block code is as shown below. In this example, we split the input data stream into 4 bit chunks and replace each of the chunks with 7 bit chunk. The mapping table between each possible 4 bit chunk(input = message) and 7 bit chunk(output = codeword) is shown below.\n\n'Linear' when you say 'Linear Coding' means a set of code in which any linear combination (modular 2 sum) of two codes within the set results in a code which also belong to the original set. Let's assume that you have a set of codes as follows. Take out any two codes from the set and take modular 2 sum of them. The result is also a member of the set as shown below. Take any other two\ncodes and try yourself.\n\n'Cyclic' is a set of code in which a code can be generated by cyclic shift of another code in the set. or in other word, any number of cyclic shift of a code in the set also fall within the set. For example, let's assume that we have a code set which is made up of following four codes. If you look into each of these codes, you would notice that any of these codes can be created by the cyclic shift of another code as illustrated below.\n\nTake the code (0 1 0 1 0 1) and cyclic shift right by one and it gives (1 0 1 0 1 0) which is also a member of the set.\n\nTake the code (0 1 0 1 0 1) and cyclic shift right by two and it gives (0 1 0 1 0 1) which is also a member of the set.\n\nIn short, in this set .. whatever code you take and however many times you do cyclic shift, the result is always within the original set.\n\nReally, Is it true ? Can I use any arbitrary mapping table as pops up in my mind now ?\n\nYes, you can. but it doesn't mean that what you created in arbitrary way would be 'efficient' mapping (coding).\n\nThen what would be the efficient coding ? There may be multiple answers to this, but some common answer would be\n\nOne of the way to perform coding is to use what is called 'Generator Function'. You might come across this term in any kind of materials related to 'Coding'. My first response when I first heard of this function was 'What the hell, is it ?'. Is it something like those functions that we learned in high school ? It looks similar to what we learned in high school days.. e.g, g(x) = x^4 + x^2\n+ 1, but the way they are used looks pretty different from high school.\n\nI would not try to give you answer to these question here.. you will get it as you proceed. What I am trying to say is \"Don't feel yourself as stupid if you have the same questions\" -:).\n\nGenerator Function is a kind of 'Binary Function' which can perform 'coding' (Convering a message to a codeword) in following manner.\n\nExpressing the equation in more detailed form, it can be expressed as shown below.\n\nThe best way to understand the real meaning of the equation above would be by example. Here goes one example.\n\nyou can pack these equations into a matrix as shown below. (Note that the lowest order comes leftmost).\n\nNow, let's figure out codeword for this message (figure out the output bit stream when this message go through the encoder block). This is the point where we use the generator function shown above. The process to calculate the codeword using the generator function is as shown below.\n\nFor practice, try all the messages shown in overview section and check if your calculation matches the codewords in the section.\n\nNow let's take a high level view of generator function (generator matrix) and see if there is any recognizable pattern. It is as shown below.\n\ni) The number of rows is same as the length of message (number of bits in message)\n\nii) The matrix contains the k x k Identity matrix, where k is the length of the message\n\nNow you would ask another again. How can I get these generator functions ? (How can I know which generator functions I have to use ?). Don't worry.. in most case these functions/matrix will be given to you from the specification of the communication system. (Of course, there is theoretical background that justifies those generator functions given by the specification and you can refer to\nCommunication Text Books or surf on internet for it. I would not get further into it). In think, just understanding the meaning of the generator functions and how to use them to implement 'encoder' block would be enough in most case.\n\nNow let's look into the codebook we generated from higher level. As shown below, you would notice that the codebook contains the message part as it is at the end and redundant bits at the beginning. This is one of the characteristics of what we call 'linear block coding'.\n\nIt is hard to cleary explain what is the convolutional code is, but you would get a rough image if you think about the 'convolution' that you learned in your engineering math.\n\nRepresenting the convolutional coding process is not simple and clearly explained in short space. So I created a separate page for this(See ConvolutionalCode page).\n\n[1] Lec 2 | MIT 6.450 Principles of Digital Communications I, Fall 2006 (YouTube) )\n\n[2] SIMULATION OF DIGITAL COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS USING MATLAB By Mathuranathan Viswanathan",

General concepts about transport channels are described in [12].\n\nA transport channel is defined by how and with what characteristics data is transferred over the air interface. A general classification of transport channels is into two groups:\n\n4.1.1\tDedicated transport channels\n\nThere exists two types of dedicated transport channel, the Dedicated Channel (DCH) and the Enhanced Dedicated Channel (E-DCH).\n\n4.1.1.1\tDCH - Dedicated Channel\n\nThe Dedicated Channel (DCH) is a downlink or uplink transport channel. The DCH is transmitted over the entire cell or over only a part of the cell using e.g. beam-forming antennas.\n\n4.1.1.2\tE-DCH - Enhanced Dedicated Channel\n\nThe Enhanced Dedicated Channel (E-DCH) is an uplink transport channel in CELL DCH.\n\n4.1.2\tCommon transport channels\n\nThere are six types of common transport channels: BCH, FACH, PCH, RACH, HS-DSCH and E-DCH.\n\n4.1.2.1\tBCH - Broadcast Channel\n\nThe Broadcast Channel (BCH) is a downlink transport channel that is used to broadcast system- and cell-specific information. The BCH is always transmitted over the entire cell and has a single non-zero transport format. In cells configured with broadcast distribution, a first BCH mapped to P-CCPCH is always present and one additional BCH mapped to S-CCPCH can be configured.\n\n4.1.2.2\tFACH - Forward Access Channel\n\nThe Forward Access Channel (FACH) is a downlink transport channel. The FACH is transmitted over the entire cell. The FACH can be transmitted using power setting described in [16].\n\n4.1.2.3\tPCH - Paging Channel\n\nThe Paging Channel (PCH) is a downlink transport channel. The PCH is always transmitted over the entire cell. The transmission of the PCH is associated with the transmission of physical-layer generated Paging Indicators, to support efficient sleep-mode procedures.\n\n4.1.2.4\tRACH - Random Access Channel\n\nThe Random Access Channel (RACH) is an uplink transport channel. The RACH is always received from the entire cell. The RACH is characterized by a collision risk and by being transmitted using open loop power control.\n\n4.1.2.7\tHS-DSCH - High Speed Downlink Shared Channel\n\nThe High Speed Downlink Shared Channel is a downlink transport channel shared by several UEs. The HS-DSCH can be associated with one downlink DPCH or F-DPCH, and one or several Shared Control Channels (HS-SCCH). The HS-DSCH is transmitted over the entire cell or over only part of the cell using e.g. beam-forming antennas.\n\n4.1.2.7A\tE-DCH - Enhanced Dedicated Channel\n\nThe Enhanced Dedicated Channel (E-DCH) is an uplink transport channel in CELL_FACH state and IDLE mode.\n\n4.2\tIndicators\n\nIndicators are means of fast low-level signalling entities which are transmitted without using information blocks sent over transport channels. The meaning of indicators is specific to the type of indicator.\n\nThe indicators defined in the current version of the specifications are: Acquisition Indicator (AI), Page Indicator (PI) and MBMS Notification Indicator (NI).\n\nIndicators may be either boolean (two-valued) or three-valued. Their mapping to indicator channels is channel specific.\n\nIndicators are transmitted on those physical channels that are indicator channels (ICH).",

The architecture and radio parts of NSA are reminded in the Figure below.\n\nThe eNB is the master node (MN) while the en-gNB is the secondary node (SN).\n\nThe E-UTRAN uses the per-UE information supplied by the MME and local E-UTRAN configuration data to determine whether or not to use Dual Connectivity for that UE. On a per-EPS bearer (4G bearer) basis, the E-UTRAN decides whether to use a Master Cell Group bearer or a Secondary Cell Group bearer, and, whether or not that bearer is a split bearer, as defined in the section on the NSA Access Network.\n\nFor example, the Master eNB can decide to use the 5G en-gNB for user data (the \"Internet\" PDN connection), as to enjoy the 5G \"high capacity\" aspect, and to use the 4G eNB for IMS Signalling and IMS voice, as to enjoy the 4G \"robust coverage layer\" aspect.\n\nThe following figures illustrate some of the alternative configurations in the context of a Master Cell Group (MCG) and a Secondary Cell Group (SCG) respectively. Note that, as in the above example, one UE can use these configurations simultaneously. Also note that, in general, the EPC has no concrete information about whether the E-UTRAN is using Dual Connectivity, nor what configuration of Dual Connectivity is in use.\n\nNote that it is also possible to operate NSA with an unmodified pre-Release 15 EPC (4G CN). In order to support the SCG bearer, the EPC does however need to support the Release 12 Dual Connectivity feature.\n\nSeveral features have been introduced to enhance the functionality of the EPC for use with NR:\n\nWithin SA3, the security aspects were examined and CRs were generated that enabled the existing EPS security algorithms to be reused for signalling confidentiality and integrity protection, and, user plane confidentiality.",

In that case the codec bit rate is reduced so that more throughput is left on the radio interface to add protection.

There is no negotiation before downgrading.\n\nC.1.1\tUplink downgrading\n\nThe following figure shows the uplink adaptation due to detection by the BTS1 of a bad quality in the uplink from the MS1.

In that case the round trip delay before the downlink adaptation is effective has an high impact. If TFO would not be active, the round trip delay would be smaller, because the Codec Mode Request sent by the BTS1 to the TRAU1 would be immediately taken into account by the TRAU1 and the new codec mode applied in downlink: without TFO ongoing the (tandem) source encoder is located in TRAU1.",

In session based charging, at least two chargeable events are needed, one each to describe the start and the end of the session, respectively. Multiple interim events are possible in order to describe changes to session characteristics (generally termed \"change of charging condition\", e.g. tariff time switch, change of PDP context QoS or change of IMS session media types), or when certain limits, e.g. time or volume, are exceeded. The CTF transforms each chargeable event into a charging event and forwards these charging events to the CDF in real-time.\n\nThe relation between chargeable events and charging events is 1:1. For event based charging, the relation between charging events and CDRs is 1:1. For session based charging, the relation between charging events and CDRs is m:n with m >=n.

    "context": "https://www.sharetechnote.com/html/Communication_ErrorCorrection.html\n\nComm. Tech.: Error Correction\n\nThere are many cases where we have to seriously consider 'Error'. Actually in almost every data processing and communications error handling is one of the most critical part of the process.\n\nSeveral common examples of the case where some form of error handling is used are as follows :\n\nYou would realize that most of digital data processing or communication would have not be realized if there is no mechism for error handling (error detection and correction)\n\nFirst let's think of the definition of 'Error'. What is 'Error' ? It is simple. Error can be defined as 'any difference between the transmitted data and received data'. This may sound specific only to communication. In case of data storage, you can define Error as 'any difference between the data being sent for writing and the data really written on a media (e.g, Hard Disk, Memory\nor CD).'\n\nOnce Error happened, we need to have some mechanism to figure out 'whether there exists any error' or 'exactly where is the error occured'. This mechanism of finding the existence of error is called 'Error Detection'. If we know the exact contents of transmitted data, it would be very simple to find out the location of errors. Just simply by comparing the transmitted data\nand received data, we can easily find the location of errors. However in realty, we don't know what is the transmitted data (original data). So we have to figure out the location of errors only from the received data. This is why Error detection is not so simple.\n\nOf course, the second type is better in most case since it will give a chance for error recovery. But in most cases, this second type tend to be more complicated to be implemented or requires more overhead for data transfer. This is why the first type of mechanism is still being used in many applications.\n\nWhat is Error Correction ? The definition is simple.. (only Algorithm is complicated :). Definition of Error Correction is to fixing the error bit (data) to normal bit (data).\n\nWhatever you do, there is no way to prevent any error. The only thing you can do for those errors is to come out with the various methods of detecting and fixing those errors. For this detection/correction, method we need to go through roughly following procedures.\n\ni) Convert (organize) the original data into a special structure in such a way that the reciever can easily detect the error. (This happens on Transmitter side).\n\niv) Check if there is any error in the received data. This is called Error Detection and happens in the reciever side.\n\nv) If errors are found in step iv), ask for retransmission (ARQ case) or try to recover(fix) the error (FEC or HARQ case). This happens in reciever side.\n\nWhen we talk about Error Detection or Correction (step v), we normally explain about step i) as well because the error detection/correction methods varies depending on step i).\n\nIn this section, I will briefly explain about several most common methods for step i) and iv), v) that are used for data communication.\n\nIf you convert data into binary stream and count the number of '1' in the data, it would be only one of two cases.. the total count of '1' is Even or Odd. In Parity Check method, transmitter reorganize the original data so that the total number of '1' is only Even (Even Parity) or only Odd (Odd Parity). Following is the example process for 'Even Parity' algorithm.\n\nThis is very simple and still being used in some simple data communication like RS 232 Serial communication. But this is detection only algorithm and it cannot correct error. Even for detection, there are many cases where this algorithm fail to detect errors. (Try think of those cases where this algorithm fails)\n\nThe concept and method of Two Dimensional Parity check is almost the same as the simple parity check explained above. The only difference is that in this algorithm we convert the data into a 2 dimensional array and apply parity bits horizontal and vertical direction as illustrated below.\n\nIn Checksum algorithm, we calculate a special number called 'checksum' value from the original data and add the checksum data to the transmitted data. When the reciever get the data, it calculate the checksum value from the received data and compares the calculated value with the received checksum value.\n\nDefinately it looks more complicated than Parity Algorithm, but it is more robust in finding errors. This is also detection only algorithm.\n\nMost common application of this algorithm is IP transmission. If you decode any IP packet decoded in wireshark, you would see the checksum field in every packet.\n\nAs in CheckSum algorithm, in CRC algorithm .. the transmitter calculate special number called CRC bits as shown in the following example and attach the value at the end of the original data and send it. When the reciever get the data, it calculate the CRC value from the received data and compares the calculated value with the CRC value.\n\nThe value m and n varies depending on cases. Normally, a standards for a specific communication technolgy (e.g, 3GPP in case of WCDMA, LTE) predefines these value.\n\nOne of the critical thing is how you determine \"Generator Function\" (sometimes called 'Divisor'). This would require deep mathematical knowledge on Field Theory.. but fortunately you don't have to pull your hair trying to determine this because the international standard in your industry would specify these functions :)\n\nNext important and confusing step would be step s3. One example is as follows. (For more practical example using less scary mathematics -:), see CRC page)\n\nHere goes a couple of example of Generator Function that is used in various communication system.\n\nThe Generator Function that is used in LTE is shown below. (3GPP 36.211 5.1.1 CRC calculation)\n\nThe Generator Function that is used in UMTS is shown below. (3GPP 25.212 4.2.1.1 CRC Calculation)\n\nWhat a system (two communicating parties) do if the reciever find (detect) an error ? We see roughly three different mode of operations depending on what kind of error handling mechanism the system uses as listed below.\n\nIn ARQ, the reciever ask for retransmission of exactly the same data by sending Nack or by skipping any Ack to the transmitter. If the transmitter does get Nack or does not get Ack within a certain time frame, it automatically retransmit the exactly the same data that was transmitted before. The advantage of this mechanism would be that it is simple to implement and it only has to implement\nerror detection algorithm and does not implement the error correction algorithm. The disadvantage would be that the transmiter would have to send the same data so many times if the channel condition is bad and the reciever keep detecting errors. Most common examples for this mechanism would be IP data or RLC layer transmission in WCDMA, LTE.\n\nIn FEC, transmitter encode the data before transmitssion in such a way that the reciever not only detect the error but also recover the error unless the amount of the error exceeds a certain level. In this case, the reciever does not request retransmission, in stead it recover (correct) errors from the redundancy bits and specially designed structure contained in the received data itself.\nThe advantage of this mechanis is obvious. It is that we don't need retransmission even when there is error. The disadvantage is that it can recover the error up to only a certain level, if there is more errors exceeding the specific level it is impossible to recover error. In order to enable more capability of error correction, we have to put more redundency bits in the transmitted data, meaning it would increase overhead.\n\nHARQ has the property of both ARQ and FEC. It is a kind of Hybrid algorithm and it is where the name come from. It is Hybrid of ARQ and FEC. When the reciever got a data with error, furst it tries to recover (correct) the error with FEC algorithm. If the error correct was successful, it send Ack to the sender. If it fails, it sends Nack to sender. When the sender got the Nack (or no response)\nfrom the reciever, it retransmit the data but when it retransmit the data, it usually send a little bit different sets of the original data (we call it 'different redundency version') and the reciever combines the previous copy and the retransmitted copy to increase probability of error recovery. The advantage of this algorithm is that it adopts the advantage of both ARQ and FEC and reducing the disadvantage of FEC and ARQ. But this would be more complicated to implement than simple ARQ and FEC. One common example\nof this mechanism is Physical layer communication in HSDPA and LTE.

In contrast to LTE, OFDM can also be used in the NR uplink (UL) direction. As a complement waveform with lower peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) to improve UL coverage, DFT-s-OFDM (OFDM with Discrete Fourier Transform precoding) can be used in the uplink although limited to single-layer transmission only.\n\nTo cope with various deployment scenarios, NR supports a wide range of carrier frequencies (within two possible ranges) and channel bandwidths, as shown in the table below.\n\nTo allow for such a flexibility, NR uses a flexible frame structure, with different Subcarrier Spacings (SCS). The SCS is the distance between the centres of two consecutive subcarriers, and the possible values for SCS are (in kHz): 15; 30; 60; 120 and 240. This is referred to as \"multiple numerologies\".\n\nA consecutive series of 12 subcarriers forms one Resource Block (RB). An NR channel bandwidth consists of a number of RBs. A Resource Element (RE) is defined as a unit of one subcarrier (frequency domain) and one OFDM symbol (time domain).\n\nAs for the time domain, it is divided in 10ms radio frames, each on consisting in 10 subframes of 1ms each, as shown in the picture below.\n\nIn turn, each subframe consists of 1/2/4/8/16 slots -shown in different colors- depending on the selected SCS/numerology.  The figure shows the cases of SCS values of 15; 30; 60 and 120 KHz, while the table below provides the full list of possible numerologies in NR. As shown in the figure for the 15 kHz case, each slot consists of 14 OFDM symbols (independently of the SCS) preceded by a cyclic prefix (CP).\n\nNote that, for the 60 kHz SCS, an extended CP is possible. The extended CP is approximately four times longer than the normal CP and is used for cells having large delay spread. In this case, one slot consists of only 12 OFDM symbols.\n\nThe OFDM symbol duration and CP length are inversely proportional of the SCS. E.g. for 15 kHz SCS, the OFDM symbol duration is approximately 66.6 µs and the CP length is approximately 4.7 µs. When the SCS is doubled, i.e. 30 kHz, the OFDM and CP lengths are approximately devided by two compared to the 15kHz SCS.\n\nNR supports both FDD and TDD operation with the same frame structure. In the case of TDD, and as to allow for flexible traffic adaptation, each OFDM symbol in a slot can be classified as 'downlink', 'uplink' or 'flexible' (i.e. either downlink or uplink). This can be configured semi-statically or it can change dynamically as part of the scheduling decision.\n\nTransmissions are usually carried out over one slot. In specific cases, transmissions can be carried out over only a fraction of a slot, with the minimum set to only two symbols. Such very short transmissions mainly target usage cases requiring low latency, such as some URLLC (Ultra Reliable, Low Latency) services.",

Without this extension there can be risk of inconsistent end user service behaviour that will ultimately prevent adding further QoS based services for a UE. It also worth noting that LTE Rel-8 has a restriction of having 8 AM bearers or 5AM+3 UM data bearers, which limits further availability for emerging differentiated data services. As an example, there can be user cases and scenarios where up to 4 RLC AM might be needed.\n\nIn response to the aforementioned limitations, TSG RAN agreed to instantiate a new LTE Rel-15 WI aiming to remove those restrictions by increasing the number of supported data radio bearers.\n\nLTE Rel-8 functionality is limited to 8 data radio bearers, which was never revised in later releases. And even though radio access and the core network signalling supports in principle up to 11 data bearers, MAC header design has logical channel ID space only for 8 bearers.\n\nRAN WG2 decided to extend the MAC header logical channel ID space from 32 to 64 code points, which allows for not only extending the number of supported data radio bearers, but also introduces a possibility to add more MAC control elements in the future. After extensive discussions between RAN and SA WGs, it was concluded to extend the number of supported data radio bearers to 15 to minimize impact to the existing information elements on the NAS and CN signalling. It is also worth noting that extended number of LTE data radio bearers is also aligned with the 5G/NR technology, in which the minimum UE requirement is to support 16 data radio bearers.\n\nAs for RAN WG3, it has been concluded that radio access interfaces already can support up to 15 data radio bearers. In addition it, there also exist procedures to handle various error cases when e.g. one eNB does not support as many bearers as has been configured by the source eNB. As a summary, no changes were introduced in RAN WG3.\n\nFinally, it bears mentioning that even though this WI aimed at increasing the number of data radio bearers for LTE connected to EPC, same enhancements can be supported by a UE supporting LTE connected to 5GC, i.e. architecture options 5 and 7. In those deployment cases when both LTE and NR are connected to the same 5GC, it allows operator to deploy and use same services irrespective of the radio access technology that a UE is configured with.",

Release 8 was frozen in December 2008 and this has been the basis for the first wave of LTE equipment. LTE specifications are very stable, with the added benefit of enhancements having been introduced in all subsequent 3GPP Releases.\n\nLTE (Long Term Evolution) or the E-UTRAN (Evolved Universal Terrestrial Access Network), introduced in 3GPP R8, is the access part of the Evolved Packet System (EPS). The main requirements for the new access network are high spectral efficiency, high peak data rates, short round trip time as well as flexibility in frequency and bandwidth.\n\nGSM was developed to carry real time services, in a circuit switched manner (blue in figure 1), with data services only possible over a circuit switched modem connection, with very low data rates. The first step towards an IP based packet switched (green in figure 1) solution was taken with the evolution of GSM to GPRS, using the same air interface and access method, TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access).\nTo reach higher data rates in UMTS (Universal Mobile Terrestrial System) a new access technology WCDMA (Wideband Code Division Multiple Access) was developed. The access network in UMTS emulates a circuit switched connection for real time services and a packet switched connection for datacom services (black in figure 1). In UMTS the IP address is allocated to the UE when a datacom service is established and released when the service is released. Incoming datacom services are therefore still relying upon the circuit switched core for paging.\nThe Evolved Packet System (EPS) is purely IP based. Both real time services and datacom services will be carried by the IP protocol. The IP address is allocated when the mobile is switched on and released when switched off.\n The new access solution, LTE, is based on OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access) and in combination with higher order modulation (up to 64QAM), large bandwidths (up to 20 MHz) and spatial multiplexing in the downlink (up to 4x4) high data rates can be achieved. The highest theoretical peak data rate on the transport channel is 75 Mbpsin the uplink, and in the downlink, using spatial multiplexing, the rate can be as high as 300 Mbps. \nThe LTE access network is simply a network of base stations, evolved NodeB (eNB), generating a flat architecture (figure 2). There is no centralized intelligent controller, and the eNBs are normally inter-connected viathe X2-interface and towards the core network by the S1-interface (figure 2). The reason for distributing the intelligence amongst the base-stations in LTE is to speed up the connection set-up and reduce the time required for a handover. For an end-user the connection set-up time for a real time data session is in many cases crucial, especially in on-line gaming. The time for a handover is essential for real-time services where end-users tend to end calls if the handover takes too long.\n\nAnother advantage with the distributed solution is that the MAC protocol layer, which is responsible for scheduling, is represented only in the UE and in the base station leading to fast communication and decisions between the eNB and the UE. In UMTS the MAC protocol, and scheduling, is located in the controller and when HSDPA was introduced an additional MAC sub-layer, responsible for HSPA scheduling was added in the NB.\nThe scheduler is a key component for the achievement of a fast adjusted and efficiently utilized radio resource. The Transmission Time Interval (TTI) is set to only 1 ms.\nDuring each TTI the eNB scheduler shall:\n\n- consider the physical radio environment per UE. The UEs report their perceived radio quality, as an input to the scheduler to decide which Modulation and Coding scheme to use. The solution relies on rapid adaptation to channel variations, employing HARQ (Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request) with soft-combining and rate adaptation.\n- prioritize the QoS service requirements amongst the UEs. LTE supports both delay sensitive real-time services as well as datacom services requiring high data peak rates. \n- inform the UEs of allocated radio resources. The eNB schedules the UEs both on the downlink and on the uplink. For each UE scheduled in a TTI the user data will be carried in a Transport Block (TB). DL there can be a maximum of two TBs generated per TTI per UE - if spatial multiplexing is used. The TB is delivered on a transport channel. In LTE the number of channels is decreased compare to UMTS. For the user plane there isonly one shared transport channel in each direction. The TB sent on the channel, can therefore contain bits from a number of services, multiplexed together.\n\nTo achieve high radio spectral efficiency as well as enable efficient scheduling in both time and frequency domain, a multicarrier approach for multiple access was chosen by 3GPP. For the downlink, OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access) was selected and for the uplink SC-FDMA (Single Carrier - Frequency Division Multiple Access) also known as DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform) spread OFDMA (figure 3).\n\nOFDM is a multicarrier technology subdividing the available bandwidth into a multitude of mutual orthogonal narrowband subcarriers. In OFDMA these subcarriers can be shared between multiple users. The OFDMA solution leads to high Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) requiring expensive power amplifiers with high requirements on linearity, increasing the power consumption for the sender. This is no problem in the eNB, but would lead to very expensive handsets. Hence a different solution was selected for the UL. As illustrated in figure 3, the SC-FDMA solution generates a signal with single carrier characteristics, hence with a low PAPR.\nTo enable possible deployment around the world, supporting as many regulatory requirements as possible, LTE is developed for a number of frequency bands - E-UTRA operating bands- currently ranging from 700 MHz up to 2.7GHz. The available bandwidths are also flexible starting with 1.4 MHz up to 20 MHz. LTE is developed to support both the time division duplex technology (TDD) as well as frequency division duplex (FDD). In R8 there are 15 bands specified for FDD and eight bands for TTD. In R9 four bands were added for FDD. Also added in R9 were for example Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service (MBMS), and Home eNB (HeNB), see figure 4. MBMS is used to provide broadcast information to all users, for example advertisement, and multicast to a closed group subscribing to a specific service, e.g. streaming TV. HeNBs are introduced mainly to provide coverage indoors, in homes or offices.The HeNB is a low power eNB that will be used in small cells - femto cells. Normally it will be owned by the customer, deployed without any network planning and connected to the operators EPC (Evolved Packet Core).\n\n- TS 36.211 Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA); Physical channels and modulation\n- TS 36.212 Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA); Multiplexing and channel coding\n- TS 36.213 Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA); Physical layer procedures\n- TS 36.300 Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA) and Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN); Overall description; Stage 2\n- TS 36.321 Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA); Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol specification\n- TS 36.331 Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA); Radio Resource Control (RRC); Protocol specification\n- TS 36.413 Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN); S1 Application Protocol (S1AP)\n- TS 36.423 Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN); X2 Application Protocol (X2AP)\n\nThe technical paper UTRA-UTRAN Long Term Evolution (LTE) and 3GPP System Architecture Evolution (SAE) is a good starting point.\n\nInitiated in 2004, the Long Term Evolution (LTE) project focused on enhancing the Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (UTRA) and optimizing 3GPP's radio access architecture.\n\nThe 3GPP 36 series of specifications, covers the \"Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA)\".\n\nSee also - the technologies page on LTE-Advanced, which describes the work beyond LTE Release 8/9.",

In that case the codec bit rate is reduced so that more throughput is left on the radio interface to add protection. The principle when TFO is active is that as soon as one side detects the need to downgrade the codec rate, it informs the other side and the codec mode is immediately downgraded. There is no negotiation before downgrading.\n\nC.1.1\tUplink downgrading\n\nThe following figure shows the uplink adaptation due to detection by the BTS1 of a bad quality in the uplink from the MS1. In that case the round trip delay between BTS1 and BTS2 has no impact, as the uplink codec adaptation is decided immediately by BTS1 and performed by the MS1.\n\nC.1.2\tDownlink downgrading\n\nThe following figure C.1.2 shows the downlink adaptation due to detection by the MS1 of a bad quality of the downlink from the BTS1. The codec mode adaptation must be performed on the far end MS (MS2), where the source encoder is located. In that case the round trip delay before the downlink adaptation is effective has an high impact. If TFO would not be active, the round trip delay would be smaller, because the Codec Mode Request sent by the BTS1 to the TRAU1 would be immediately taken into account by the TRAU1 and the new codec mode applied in downlink: without TFO ongoing the (tandem) source encoder is located in TRAU1.",

In order to fulfil these requirements, appropriate charging information needs to be generated and collected by the network elements or network functions of the 3GPP network and forwarded to appropriate charging and billing systems.\n\nSeveral logical charging functions are needed in the network in order to provide the functionality described above for online and offline charging, respectively. These charging functions are specified in detail in this clause, together with the reference points and service based interface that are used to transfer charging information between those functions. While the overall possibilities that exist within the 3GPP standards for the physical mapping of these logical functions are described in the present document, the exact situation that applies to the various domains, subsystems and services of the network is specified in the middle tier TS that is specific to that domain/subsystem/service (i.e. TS 32.25x, TS 32.26x and TS 32.27x).\n\nIn offline charging, the charging information is transferred from the network to the Billing Domain (BD), where it is processed for billing and/or statistical purposes, at the discretion of the PLMN operator. While the internal functions of the BD are outside the scope of 3GPP standardisation, the reference point for the charging information transfer from the network to the BD does form a part of the 3GPP standards and is therefore also specified in the present clause.\n\nIn online charging, the charging information is transferred from the network to the Online Charging System (OCS) or to the Converged Charging System (CCS). The OCS or CCS, in turn, may have an offline charging reference point used to forward charging information to the BD that is similar in scope and intent to the offline charging case described in the previous paragraph.

The base requirement was to provide at least the same security features as LTE.\n\nNon-Standalone NR Security\n\nThe NSA architecture uses LTE as the master radio access technology, while the new radio access technology (i.e. NR) serves as secondary radio access technology with User Equipment's (UEs) connected to both radios. Except for capability negotiation, security procedures for EN-DC basically follow the specifications for dual connectivity security for LTE. The WI summary for EDCE5 security (cf. corresponding clause above) provides details.\n\nEvolution of the trust model\n\nMoving on from the Non-Standalone deployment, in a Standalone 5G system, the trust model has evolved. Trust within the network is considered as decreasing the further one moves from the core. This has impact on decisions taken in 5G security design, thus we present the trust model in this section.\n\nThe trust model in the UE is reasonably simple: there are two trust domains, the tamper proof UICC on which the Universal Subscriber Identity Module (USIM) resides as trust anchor and the Mobile Equipment (ME). The ME and the USIM together form the UE.\n\nThe network side trust model for roaming and non-roaming cases are shown in the two following figures respectively, which shows the trust in multiple layers, like in an onion.\n\nThe Radio Access Network (RAN) is separated into distributed units (DU, or gNB-DU) and central units (CU, or gNB-CU) - DU and CU together form the gNB, as seen above. The DU does not have any access to customer communications as it may be deployed in unsupervised sites. The CU and Non-3GPP Inter Working Function (N3IWF - not shown in the figures), which terminates the Access Stratum (AS) security, will be deployed in sites with more restricted access.\n\nIn the Core Network, the Access Management Function (AMF) serves as termination point for Non-Access Stratum (NAS) security. Currently, i.e. in the 3GPP 5G Phase 1 specification, the AMF is collocated with the SEcurity Anchor Function (SEAF) that holds the root key (known as anchor key) for the visited network. The security architecture is defined in a future proof fashion, as it allows separation of the security anchor from the mobility function that could be possible in a future evolution of the system architecture.\n\nThe AUthentication Function (AUSF) keeps a key for reuse, derived after authentication, in case of simultaneous registration of a UE in different access network technologies, i.e. 3GPP access networks and non-3GPP access networks such as IEEE 802.11 Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN). Authentication credential Repository and Processing Function (ARPF) keeps the authentication credentials. This is mirrored by the USIM on the side of the client, i.e. the UE side. The subscriber information is stored in the Unified Data Repository (UDR). The Unified Data Management (UDM) uses the subscription data stored in UDR and implements the application logic to perform various functionalities such as authentication credential generation, user identification, service and session continuity etc. Over the air interface, both active and passive attacks are considered on both control plane and user plane. Privacy has become increasingly important leading to permanent identifiers being kept secret over the air interface.\n\nIn the roaming architecture, the home and the visited network are connected through SEcurity Protection Proxy (SEPP) for the control plane of the internetwork interconnect. This enhancement is done in 5G because of the number of attacks coming to light recently such as key theft and re-routing attacks in SS7 and network node impersonation and source address spoofing in signalling messages in DIAMETER that exploited the trusted nature of the internetwork interconnect.\n\n5G Phase 1 Security (Release 15)\n\n5G Phase 1 brings several enhancements to LTE security, some of the key points are presented in this section. Details of 5G Phase 1 security can be found in TS 33.501 [1].\n\nPrimary authentication: Network and device mutual authentication in 5G is based on primary authentication. This is similar to LTE but there are a few differences. The authentication mechanism has in-built home control allowing the home operator to know whether the device is authenticated in a given network and to take final call of authentication. In 5G Phase 1 there are two mandatory authentication options: 5G Authentication and Key Agreement (5G-AKA) and Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)-AKA', i.e. EAP-AKA'. Optionally, other EAP based authentication mechanisms are also allowed in 5G - for specific cases such as private networks. Also, primary authentication is radio access technology independent, thus it can run over non-3GPP technology such as IEEE 802.11 WLANs.\n\nSecondary authentication: Secondary authentication in 5G is meant for authentication with data networks outside the mobile operator domain. For this purpose, different EAP based authentication methods and associated credentials can be used. A similar service was possible in LTE as well, but now it is integrated in the 5G architecture.\n\nInter-operator security: Several security issues exist in the inter-operator interface arising from SS7 or Diameter [5,6] in the earlier generations of mobile communication systems. To counter these issues, 5G Phase 1 provides inter-operator security from the very beginning.\n\nPrivacy: Subscriber identity related issues have been known since LTE and earlier generations of mobile systems. In 5G a privacy solution is developed that protects the user's subscription permanent identifier against active attacks. A home network public key is used to provide subscriber identity privacy.\n\nService based architecture (SBA): The 5G core network is based on a service based architecture, which did not exist in LTE and earlier generations. Thus 5G also provides adequate security for SBA.\n\nCentral Unit (CU) - Distributed Unit (DU): In 5G the base-station is logically split in CU and DU with an interface (the F1) between them. Security is provided for the CU-DU interface. This split was also possible in LTE, but in 5G it is part of the architecture that can support a number of deployment options (e.g. co-located CU-DU deployment is also possible). The DUs, which are deployed at the very edge of the network, don't have access to any user data when confidentiality protection is enabled. Even with the CU-DU split, the air interface security point in 5G remains the same as in LTE, namely in the radio access network.\n\nKey hierarchy: The 5G hierarchy reflects the changes in the overall architecture and the trust model using the security principle of key separation. One main difference in 5G compared to LTE is the possibility for integrity protection of the user plane.\n\nMobility: Although mobility in 5G is similar to LTE, the difference in 5G is the assumption that the mobility anchor in the core network can be separated from the security anchor.\n\nReferences",

    "context": "https://www.sharetechnote.com/html/Communication_ErrorCorrection.html\n\nComm. Tech.: Error Correction\n\nThere are many cases where we have to seriously consider 'Error'. Actually in almost every data processing and communications error handling is one of the most critical part of the process.\n\nSeveral common examples of the case where some form of error handling is used are as follows :\n\nYou would realize that most of digital data processing or communication would have not be realized if there is no mechism for error handling (error detection and correction)\n\nFirst let's think of the definition of 'Error'. What is 'Error' ? It is simple. Error can be defined as 'any difference between the transmitted data and received data'. This may sound specific only to communication. In case of data storage, you can define Error as 'any difference between the data being sent for writing and the data really written on a media (e.g, Hard Disk, Memory\nor CD).'\n\nOnce Error happened, we need to have some mechanism to figure out 'whether there exists any error' or 'exactly where is the error occured'. This mechanism of finding the existence of error is called 'Error Detection'. If we know the exact contents of transmitted data, it would be very simple to find out the location of errors. Just simply by comparing the transmitted data\nand received data, we can easily find the location of errors. However in realty, we don't know what is the transmitted data (original data). So we have to figure out the location of errors only from the received data. This is why Error detection is not so simple.\n\nOf course, the second type is better in most case since it will give a chance for error recovery. But in most cases, this second type tend to be more complicated to be implemented or requires more overhead for data transfer. This is why the first type of mechanism is still being used in many applications.\n\nWhat is Error Correction ? The definition is simple.. (only Algorithm is complicated :). Definition of Error Correction is to fixing the error bit (data) to normal bit (data).\n\nWhatever you do, there is no way to prevent any error. The only thing you can do for those errors is to come out with the various methods of detecting and fixing those errors. For this detection/correction, method we need to go through roughly following procedures.\n\ni) Convert (organize) the original data into a special structure in such a way that the reciever can easily detect the error. (This happens on Transmitter side).\n\niv) Check if there is any error in the received data. This is called Error Detection and happens in the reciever side.\n\nv) If errors are found in step iv), ask for retransmission (ARQ case) or try to recover(fix) the error (FEC or HARQ case). This happens in reciever side.\n\nWhen we talk about Error Detection or Correction (step v), we normally explain about step i) as well because the error detection/correction methods varies depending on step i).\n\nIn this section, I will briefly explain about several most common methods for step i) and iv), v) that are used for data communication.\n\nIf you convert data into binary stream and count the number of '1' in the data, it would be only one of two cases.. the total count of '1' is Even or Odd. In Parity Check method, transmitter reorganize the original data so that the total number of '1' is only Even (Even Parity) or only Odd (Odd Parity). Following is the example process for 'Even Parity' algorithm.\n\nThis is very simple and still being used in some simple data communication like RS 232 Serial communication. But this is detection only algorithm and it cannot correct error. Even for detection, there are many cases where this algorithm fail to detect errors. (Try think of those cases where this algorithm fails)\n\nThe concept and method of Two Dimensional Parity check is almost the same as the simple parity check explained above. The only difference is that in this algorithm we convert the data into a 2 dimensional array and apply parity bits horizontal and vertical direction as illustrated below.\n\nIn Checksum algorithm, we calculate a special number called 'checksum' value from the original data and add the checksum data to the transmitted data. When the reciever get the data, it calculate the checksum value from the received data and compares the calculated value with the received checksum value.\n\nDefinately it looks more complicated than Parity Algorithm, but it is more robust in finding errors. This is also detection only algorithm.\n\nMost common application of this algorithm is IP transmission. If you decode any IP packet decoded in wireshark, you would see the checksum field in every packet.\n\nAs in CheckSum algorithm, in CRC algorithm .. the transmitter calculate special number called CRC bits as shown in the following example and attach the value at the end of the original data and send it. When the reciever get the data, it calculate the CRC value from the received data and compares the calculated value with the CRC value.\n\nThe value m and n varies depending on cases. Normally, a standards for a specific communication technolgy (e.g, 3GPP in case of WCDMA, LTE) predefines these value.\n\nOne of the critical thing is how you determine \"Generator Function\" (sometimes called 'Divisor'). This would require deep mathematical knowledge on Field Theory.. but fortunately you don't have to pull your hair trying to determine this because the international standard in your industry would specify these functions :)\n\nNext important and confusing step would be step s3. One example is as follows. (For more practical example using less scary mathematics -:), see CRC page)\n\nHere goes a couple of example of Generator Function that is used in various communication system.\n\nThe Generator Function that is used in LTE is shown below. (3GPP 36.211 5.1.1 CRC calculation)\n\nThe Generator Function that is used in UMTS is shown below. (3GPP 25.212 4.2.1.1 CRC Calculation)\n\nWhat a system (two communicating parties) do if the reciever find (detect) an error ? We see roughly three different mode of operations depending on what kind of error handling mechanism the system uses as listed below.\n\nIn ARQ, the reciever ask for retransmission of exactly the same data by sending Nack or by skipping any Ack to the transmitter. If the transmitter does get Nack or does not get Ack within a certain time frame, it automatically retransmit the exactly the same data that was transmitted before. The advantage of this mechanism would be that it is simple to implement and it only has to implement\nerror detection algorithm and does not implement the error correction algorithm. The disadvantage would be that the transmiter would have to send the same data so many times if the channel condition is bad and the reciever keep detecting errors. Most common examples for this mechanism would be IP data or RLC layer transmission in WCDMA, LTE.\n\nIn FEC, transmitter encode the data before transmitssion in such a way that the reciever not only detect the error but also recover the error unless the amount of the error exceeds a certain level. In this case, the reciever does not request retransmission, in stead it recover (correct) errors from the redundancy bits and specially designed structure contained in the received data itself.\nThe advantage of this mechanis is obvious. It is that we don't need retransmission even when there is error. The disadvantage is that it can recover the error up to only a certain level, if there is more errors exceeding the specific level it is impossible to recover error. In order to enable more capability of error correction, we have to put more redundency bits in the transmitted data, meaning it would increase overhead.\n\nHARQ has the property of both ARQ and FEC. It is a kind of Hybrid algorithm and it is where the name come from. It is Hybrid of ARQ and FEC. When the reciever got a data with error, furst it tries to recover (correct) the error with FEC algorithm. If the error correct was successful, it send Ack to the sender. If it fails, it sends Nack to sender. When the sender got the Nack (or no response)\nfrom the reciever, it retransmit the data but when it retransmit the data, it usually send a little bit different sets of the original data (we call it 'different redundency version') and the reciever combines the previous copy and the retransmitted copy to increase probability of error recovery. The advantage of this algorithm is that it adopts the advantage of both ARQ and FEC and reducing the disadvantage of FEC and ARQ. But this would be more complicated to implement than simple ARQ and FEC. One common example\nof this mechanism is Physical layer communication in HSDPA and LTE.

In addition, the Ethernet traffic is also supported by the SMF/UPF for interworking with external DN.\n\nReferences\n\nThe main protocols of the 5G Core Network are specified in:\n\nThe corresponding Security aspects of 5G System are defined by SA3 (UID: 750016). The work also serves as the basis for related charging and management, i.e., Data Charging in 5G System Architecture Phase 1 (UID: 780035), Service Based Interface for 5G Charging (UID: 780034), Management and orchestration of 5G networks and network slicing (UID: 760066).",

Polarized antennas are likely to be the primary way to implement multiple antennas.  A cross-polarized model is therefore included here.\n\nA method of describing polarized antennas is presented, which is compatible with the 13 step procedure given in Clause 5.3.  The following steps replace step 13 with the new steps 13-19 to account for the additional polarized components.  The (S/2)-element BS arrays and (U/2)-element MS arrays consist of U and S (i.e., twice in number)antennas in the V, H, or off-axis polarization.\n\nStep 13:  Generate additional cross-polarized subpaths. For each of the 6 paths of Step 4, generate an additional M subpaths at the MS and M subpaths at the BS to represent the portion of each signal that leaks into the cross-polarized antenna orientation due to scattering.\n\nStep 14:. Set subpath AoDs and AoAs. Set the AoD and AoA of each subpath in Step 13 equal to that of the corresponding subpath of the co-polarized antenna orientation.  (Orthogonal sub-rays arrive/depart at common angles.)\n\nStep 15: Generate phase offsets for the cross-polarized elements. We define  to be the phase offset of the mth subpath of the nth path between the x component (e.g. either the horizontal h or vertical v) of the BS element and the y component (e.g. either the horizontal h or vertical v) of the MS element. Set  to be  generated in Step 8 of Clause 5.3. Generate , , and  as i.i.d random variables drawn from a uniform 0 to 360 degree distribution.  (x and y can alternatively represent the co-polarized and cross-polarized orientations.)\n\nStep 16: Decompose each of the co-polarized and cross-polarized sub-rays into vertical and horizontal components based on the co-polarized and cross-polarized orientations.\n\nStep 17: The coupled power P2 of each sub-path in the horizontal orientation is set relative to the power P1 of each sub-path in the vertical orientation according to an XPD ratio, defined as XPD= P1/P2. A single XPD ratio applies to all sub-paths of a given path. Each path n experiences an independent realization of the XPD. For each path the realization of the XPD is drawn from the distributions below.\n\nFor urban macrocells:  P2 = P1 - A - B*(0,1), where A=0.34*(mean relative path power in dB)+7.2 dB, and B=5.5dB is the standard deviation of the XPD variation.\n\nFor urban microcells:  P2 = P1 - A - B*(0,1), where A=8 dB, and B=8dB is the standard deviation of the XPD variation.\n\nThe value (0,1) is a zero mean Gaussian random number with unit variance and is held constant for all sub-paths of a given path.\n\nBy symmetry, the coupled power of the opposite process (horizontal to vertical) is the same. The V-to-H XPD draws are independent of the H-to-V draws.\n\nStep 18: At the receive antennas, decompose each of the vertical and horizontal components into components that are co-polarized with the receive antennas and sum the components. This procedure is performed within the channel coefficient expression given below.\n\nStep 19: Apply the path loss based on the BS to MS distance from Step 2, and the log normal shadow fading determined in step 3 as bulk parameters to each of the sub-path powers of the channel model.\n\nThe fading behavior between the cross pol elements will be a function of the per-ray spreads and the Doppler.  The fading between orthogonal polarizations has been observed to be independent and therefore the sub-rays phases are chosen randomly.  The propagation characteristics of V-to-V paths are assumed to be equivalent to the propagation characteristics of H-to-H paths.\n\nThe polarization model can be illustrated by a matrix describing the propagation of and mixing between horizontal and vertical amplitude of each sub-path.  The resulting channel realization is:\n\nwhere:\n\nThe other variables are described in Clause 5.4.  Note that the description above corresponds to a transmission from the base to mobile. The appropriate subscript and superscript changes should be made for uplink transmissions.\n\nThe 2x2 matrix represents the scattering phases and amplitudes of a plane wave leaving the UE with a given angle and polarization and arriving Node B with another direction and polarization.  is the average power ratio of waves leaving the UE in the vertical direction and arriving at Node B in the horizontal direction (v-h) to those arriving at Node B in the vertical direction (v-v). By symmetry the power ratio of the opposite process (h-v over v-v) is chosen to be the same.  Note that: =1/XPD; for the macrocell model, the XPD is dependent on the path index; for the microcell model, the XPD is independent of path index.\n\nExpression (2) assumes a random pairing of the of the sub-paths from the MS and BS. The random orientation of the MS (UE) array affects the value of the angle  of each sub-path.\n\nIf for example, only vertically polarized antennas are used at both NodeB and UE then the antenna responses become  and expression (2) becomes identical to (1). For an ideal dipole antenna at the NodeB tilted with respect to the z-axis at degrees the above vector becomes .\n\nThe elevation spectrum is not modeled.",

A slot transmission is simply a shortening of the current subframe transmission in half, while a subslot transmission consist of either a 2-symbol or a 3-symbol transmission duration.\n\nThe subslot division in a subframe is fixed in the UL while it varies depending on the first potential symbol for PDSCH in the DL, as shown in Figure 13.8-2. Each subframe is divided into up to 6 subslots. Subslot operation is not defined for lDataStart=4.\n\nThe slot operation is defined for both FS1 and FS2, while subslot operation is only defined for FS1. FS3 is not supported.\n\nThe combinations of slot and subslot operation on DL and UL are shown in Table 1. The asymmetric operation of subslot in DL and slot in UL is primarily allowed to improve coverage for the UL control channel.\n\nIn a carrier aggregation setting, an sTTI DL/UL combination is configured per component carrier (CC). A CA PUCCH group should have the same UL/DL sTTI configuration for the sTTI-configured SCells and the cell carrying PUCCH. However Different DL/UL sTTI lengths can be configured for the serving cells across different PUCCH groups. sTTI operation can also be configured in a DL only Scell. The maximum number of supported UL and DL sTTI carriers is the same as in 1 ms TTI operation. Cross-carrier scheduling is not supported for sTTI.\n\nThe physical channels for subslot and slot operation are given in Table 13.8-3.\n\nAs can be seen, although the transmission duration of the data channels (PDSCH/PUSCH) also follows the slot and subslot transmission duration, they are not defined as new physical channels. Except for some changes on the transport block size (TBS), resource allocation scheme and DL/UL UE-specific reference signal pattern, the main characteristics of the 1 ms data channels have been maintained. Both UL and DL control channels, on the other hand, have been significantly re-designed motivating to treat them as separate physical channels in the specification. SPUCCH follows subslot and slot duration (including also SR with a periodicity down to 1 subslot), while SPDCCH has either 1 os, 2 os or 3 os duration, transmitted at the start of each subslot/slot, and may span only configured frequency resources as illustrated in Figure 13.8-3.\n\nA fallback mode to 1 ms transmission is also supported for subslot and slot operation, the fallback is dynamic and can occur on a subframe to subframe basis. The UE needs to monitor both 1 ms and subslot/slot based control. Collision handling in case of simultaneous subslot/slot and subframe transmission in UL on the same CC has been specified to ensure a consistent UE behaviour.\n\nBoth CRS-based and DMRS-based demodulation is supported for SPDCCH and in case of CRS-based SPDCCH, the mapping of the SPDCCH can be configured to be either over 1 or 2 symbols in time (1 symbol illustrated above in Figure 3). In case of DMRS-based SPDCCH, the control is always mapped over 2 symbols for slot-based SPDCCH, while for subslot it aligns with the subslot duration (2 or 3 symbols).\n\nTo efficiently make use of the control resources not used in a subslot/slot, a re-use mechanism is specified to re-use the control region for data, illustrated in Figure 4. Both a semi-static and dynamic mechanism is specified. The efficiency of the re-use depends on the configuration (ideal re-use assumed in Figure 13.8-4).\n\nTo further minimize overhead, the DL DMRS can be shared between two consecutive subslots within a slot . The presence of the DL DMRS for PDSCH in subslot operation is indicated in the DL DCI (present or not). In UL the DMRS can be shared between all three subslots of a slot. The UL DMRS presence and position is indicated in the UL DCI. A possible configuration of the UL DMRS in a subframe that minimizes DMRS overhead is illustrated in Figure 13.8-5.\n\nThe specification also allows for DMRSs symbols to be shared between UEs in the UL, also referred to as DMRS multiplexing. In this case, an IFDMA based DMRS is typically used which allows users of different resource allocation to share the DMRS symbol by the use of different IFDMA combs, maintaining orthogonality between UEs.\n\nAs with short processing time for 1 ms, subslot/slot transmissions are associated with asynchronous HARQ operation on the UL. The processing time compared to regular 1 ms operation and the maximum timing advance are also reduced for both slot and subslot operation. In case of subslot operation, the UE can in its capability indicate the support of different processing timeline sets with associated maximum timing advance depending on the DL control channel configuration (DMRS-based SPDCCH, 1os CRS-based SPDCCH or 2os CRS-based SPDCCH). The processing timelines and associated maximum timing advance is summarized in Table 13.8-4. As can be seen, for each processing timeline set, there are two possible processing timelines (for example n+4 and n+6 for Set 1). Which one to use is under network control and configured by RRC (depending on the timing advance assigned to the UE).\n\nThe number of HARQ processes has been increased to 16 for slot/subslot operation and the HARQ processes can be shared between subslot/slot and 1 ms operation (with the restriction that the TBS and number of codewords limitations of subslot/slot need to be respected in case of initial transmission on 1 ms with a later retransmission on subslot/slot).\n\nA new set of DCI formats, named DCI format 7.x is associated with sTTI for slot and subslots scheduling. Among the specific features of these DCI formats, resource allocation has been modified to reflect the shorter TTI and therefore the granularity in RB allocation is increased.\n\nAdditional functionality also specified in the feature is sTTI specific aperiodic CSI reporting which includes measuring on a slot/subslot CSI reference resource as well as faster triggering and faster processing time for the CSI to be reported. Periodic CSI reporting is not supported.\n\nAlso, semi-persistent scheduling is specified for sTTI with similar functionality as in legacy operation. A contention based SPS operation is allowed where different UEs can be assigned different cyclic shifts and IFDMA combs for the DMRS, but fully/partially overlapping resource allocation.\n\nReferences",

It is mainly for 5G Radio System. Even though no 3GPP specification about 5G is available, this project will contribute a lot in 5G community. Refer to OpenAirInterface home page for the details.\n\nOpenAirInterface (OAI) Software Alliance aims to further the software towards future 3GPP releases for 5G. The main goal of the alliance is to create an ecosystem of industrial/non-profit/academic organizations to implement reference solution for 3GPP standards. The OAI is striving to become a tool used by both the industry and academic for using community driven development to accelerate innovation in 5G wireless technologies, and to bring the huge economic success to this part of information technology. The OAI targets a reference implementation of Release 14 LTE based on the current 4G implementation and to progressively add enhancements from 3GPP study items defining the future 5G standard.\n\nOpenAirInterface is an open source implementation of 3GPP stack. It covers different parts of 3GPP stack (eNodeB, UE, MME, HSS, S-GW, P-GW). The software runs on general purpose computing platform (for ex. Intel/ARM) and interfaces with wide variety of SDR platforms (EXMIMO, USRP, BladeRF, LimeSDR).\n\nThe OAI currently implements Rel 8/10 stack for eNB/UE/EPC. It runs on standard Ubuntu Linux 14.04 LTS with low-latency kernel for eNB/UE. OAI requires Intel processors which support (SSE3/SSE4), however support for AVX2 is optional. It is also a requirement to have USB3/PCIe on a PC which interfaces with SDR platforms (USRP, BladeRF, EXMIMO and LimeSDR). The code compiles with standard GNU toolchain that comes with Linux. OAI can be also run in simulation mode (oaisim), the details of which are provided by Open Air Usage tutorials on the gitlab server@EURECOM.\n\nThe OAI software packages used to deploy an operators core network, the Enhanced Packet Core or EPC, are collectively known as openairCN while the access network software for base stations and terminals goes under the name of openair5G.\n\nThe EPC is quickly being integrated with other open source software packages providing telecommunication services and solutions for network management (e.g. openIMS, Clearwater IMS, OpenDayLight, Open Source MANO (OSM), OpNFV) on the generic cloud computing platform OpenStack. To ease integration with OpenStack software packages, and because revenues from the EPC are less dependent on intellectual property agreements, openairCN is distributed with a standard Apache V2.0 license, which is quite common in cloud computing software. The access network software openair5G, on the other hand, is freely distributed by the OAI under the terms stipulated by a new open source licence, the OAI Public License, catering to the intellectual property agreements used in 3GPP and allowing contributions from 3GPP members holding patents on key procedures used in the standard. The OAI is working closely with ETSI to harmonise the software licence with the intellectual property policy of 3GPP. The end result is that groups can use the software as any Apache V2.0 software for non-commercial purposes (e.g. for study and research) while for commercial exploitation of the community software, users are bound to respect intellectual property agreements associated with the 3GPP standard as with proprietary hardware and software. For details on OAI licensing model, please refer to OAI License Model page.\n\nSince, the evolution of 5G is still under discussion within academia/industry, we plan to identify different areas in which different members of the alliance create projects. The projects are created with the goal of furthering these strategic areas within the alliance and making sure the output of the project is merged back with the main repository at some point. The strategic areas of the alliance ratified by the board are listed here.\n\nIn order to install OAI successfully, it is important to follow HW/SW requirements. Almost all the technical documentation is hosted on EURECOM gitlab server. The entry point for wiki for openair5G is OAI Wiki/Home and the entry point for openairCN is OAI-CN Wiki/Home is here. There are several tutorials inside Gitlab page to run OAI in various modes (Emulation, Simulation, real-time with COTS UE, etc). The mailing lists for both user and developer community is OAI Wiki/Mailinglist. The gitlab workflow/coding guidelines/contributing guidelines are here.\n\nOAI hosts several training/workshops periodically for roadmap discussions with the community and also to train the community regarding the software implementation. For more information, refer to OAI Community/Workshop.\n\nThe Alliance offers several membership models for companies, non-profit institutions and individual contributors. The membership is free for individuals/non-profit organizations, however there is fee for corporations. For more info regarding membership, refer to OSA/JoinUs.\n\nQ2. Is there any operating system requirement ? (What type of linux ? what version ? etc) What is Operating System details that has been verified by OAI developers.\n\nQ4. What kind of hardware can be used to run OAI and what are those which has been verified by OAI developer ?\n\nQ4-1. Would OAI be runnable on USRP Embedded Sieries ? (Any verification activity done ?)\n\n[Ans] Yes, but we have not tried it. OAI needs to be ported to ZynQ to run on USRP Embedded series.\n\nQ4-2.There are many different series of USRP. Is there any specific series/model that is not usable for OAI ? (In terms of performance etc)\n\n[Ans] It is not recommended to use USRP N series as it is not able to do LTE sampling rate (30.72 for 20 MHz). In order to use USRP N-series, LTE sampling rate needs to be implemented in software on a PC\n\nQ5. Is there any additional libraries or tools that are required to OAI stack ? (e.g, GNU Radio or FFTW etc)\n\n[Ans] There are additional libraries required but they are installed automatically by OAI scripts (Refer to OAI Autobuild for details).\n\nQ7. Is it possible to develop use OAI as software simulator without hardware ? (Like Matlab LTE toolbox)\n\n[Ans] Yes, it has a simulation mode called oaisim (Refer to OIA Wiki/OpenAirUsage for details).\n\n[Ans] 5 Mhz and 10 Mhz has been most extensively tested as of now (Apr 2016) and 20 MHz is close to being released as well, but theoretically it should work with all bands\n\nQ10.

Therefore, if support for Ro based online charging is required instead of / or in addition to application server or MRFC, a special CTF is needed in order to mediate between the Ro based SBCF and the SIP based service control. This role is taken by the IMS Gateway Function (IMS GWF), which translates between SIP service control towards the S-CSCF and Ro Credit-Control on the OCS side.\n\nFrom the perspective of the online charging architecture, the IMS GWF is an online charging capable CTF; from the perspective of the S-CSCF, the IMS GWF is a SIP application server and is triggered the same way.

In order to achieve wider bandwidth, carrier aggregation (CA) of up to 16 NR carriers is further supported. Both CA within a frequency band (intra-band CA) and CA across frequency bands (inter-band CA) are supported. For the case of inter-band CA, CA with different numerologies, e.g., CA between NR carrier in FR1 and NR carrier in FR2, is also supported.\n\nNR newly defines the concept of bandwidth part (BWP). A UE can be configured with up to four BWPs per NR carrier for DL and UL, respectively. Each BWP has its own parameters including bandwidth and numerology. The bandwidth of the BWP is configured for each UE according to the UE capability on supported maximum bandwidth, and hence multiple UEs having different bandwidth capabilities can be served in a single wideband NR carrier. Also, multiple BWPs with different numerologies can be multiplexed within a single NR carrier to support different types of services. The bandwidth of the BWP can be narrower than the supported maximum bandwidth for the UE so that UE power saving is achieved. In addition, BWP adaptation based on switching between BWPs having different bandwidths and/or numerologies is supported.\n\nFor EN-DC operation, simultaneous UL transmissions across LTE and NR are supported.

The system consists of the major components TRAU and BTS on the network side and the MS. On the network side, speech encoder (SPE) and channel encoder (CHE) as well as channel decoder (CHD) and speech decoder (SPD) are connected via the serial A-bis interface. For each link, quality information is derived by estimating the current channel state. Based on the channel state,  and also taking into consideration possible constraints from network control, the codec mode control, which is located on the network side, selects the codec modes to be applied.\n\nThe channel mode to use (TCH/AFS, TCH/AHS, O-TCH/AHS, TCH/WFS, O-TCH/WFS or O-TCH/WHS) is controlled by the network. Uplink and downlink always apply the same channel mode.\n\nFor codec mode adaptation the receiving side performs link quality measurements of the incoming link. The measurements are processed yielding a Quality Indicator. For uplink adaptation, the Quality Indicator is directly fed into the UL mode control unit. This unit compares the Quality Indicator with certain thresholds and generates, also considering possible constraints from network control, a Codec Mode Command indicating the codec mode to be used on the uplink. The Codec Mode Command is then transmitted inband to the mobile side where the incoming speech signal is encoded in the corresponding codec mode. For downlink adaptation, the DL Mode Request Generator within the mobile compares the DL Quality indicator with certain thresholds and generates a Codec Mode Request indicating the preferred codec mode for the downlink. The Codec Mode Request is transmitted inband to the network side where it is fed into the DL Mode Control unit. This unit generally grants the requested mode. However, considering possible constraints from network control, it may also override the request. The resulting codec mode is then applied for encoding of the incoming speech signal in downlink direction. Both for uplink and downlink, the presently applied codec mode is transmitted inband as Codec Mode Indication together with the coded speech data. At the decoder, the Codec Mode Indication is decoded and applied for decoding of the received speech data.\n\nCodec mode selection is done from a set of codec modes (ACS, Active Codec Set), which may include 1 to 4 AMR codec modes. Associated with this set is a list of 1 to 3 switching thresholds and hysteresis used by the DL Mode Request Generator and the UL mode control unit to generate the Codec Mode Requests and Codec Mode Commands. These configuration parameters (ACS, thresholds, hysteresis) are defined at call set-up and can be modified at handover or during a call.\n\n3.1.2\tOperation with ongoing Tandem Free Operation\n\nIf tandem free operation is ongoing (see 3GPP TS 28.062) then the speech signal has to be transmitted over two radio links, first uplink (MS1 to BTS1)  and then downlink (BTS2 to MS2), respectively symmetrically in the reverse direction. The optimal Codec Mode in direction MS1 to MS2 shall be derived from the Codec Mode Command for the first uplink (CMC1, within BTS1) and the Codec Mode Request derived for the second downlink (CMR2 within MS2) in the following way: MS2 shall send the CMR2 back to BTS2 in the usual way. BTS2 shall either accept this CMR2 (default) or may modify it according to network control needs: CMR2´. Then BTS2 shall send the CMR2´ further uplink to its TRAU2, to TRAU1 and downlink to BTS1 (see 3GPP TS 28.062 on how this transmission shall be handled on Abis and A interfaces). BTS1 combines the received CMR2´ with its own derived CMC1 by taking the minimum of both values. If needed, BTS1 may modify this minimum value according to own network control (--> CMC1´´) and shall send it finally downlink to MS1 as CMC. The identical procedure shall be performed in the reverse direction. Annex C gives an informative description.\n\n3.1.3\tOperation at handover with ongoing Tandem Free Operation\n\nBefore and during an handover at one or both sides of the MS-to-MS connection, it may be needed to freeze the codec mode adaptation for a short while, e.g. to optimise the common Active Codec Set, or to allow fast (re-)synchronisation between BTS and TRAU or to optimise the CMI Phase in downlink. Both BTSs may therefore enable or disable the codec mode adaptation (see 3GPP TS 28.062). As long as the codec mode adaptation is frozen to a specific codec mode, then this codec mode shall be used in both directions as long as tandem free operation is ongoing, or tandem free operation shall be discontinued. The Codec Mode Requests from the MSs may be taken into account to decide whether to continue TFO or not, but not for codec mode adaptation.",

As in the macrocell case, N = 6 paths are modeled. We list the entire procedure but only describe the details of the steps that differ from the corresponding step of the macrocell procedure.\n\nStep 1: Choose the urban microcell environment.\n\nStep 2: Determine various distance and orientation parameters.\n\nStep 3: Determine the bulk path loss and log normal shadow fading parameters.\n\nStep 4: Determine the random delays for each of the N multipath components. For the microcell environment, N = 6. The delays n = 1, … , N are i.i.d. random variables drawn from a uniform distribution from 0 to 1.2 s.\n\nStep 5:  The minimum of these delays is subtracted from all so that the first delay is zero. The delays are quantized in time to the nearest 1/16th chip interval as described in Clause 5.3.1. When the LOS model is used, the delay of the direct component will be set equal to the first arriving path with zero delay.\n\nStep 6: Determine random average powers for each of the N multipath components. The PDP consists of N=6 distinct paths that are uniformly distributed between 0 and 1.2s. The powers for each path are exponentially decaying in time with the addition of a lognormal randomness, which is independent of the path delay:\n\nStep 7: Determine  AoDs for each of the N multipath components. The AoDs (with respect to the LOS direction) are i.i.d. random variables drawn from a uniform distribution over -40 to +40 degrees:\n\nAssociate the AoD of the nth pathwith the power of the nth path . Note unlike the macrocell environment, the AoDs do not need to be sorted before being assigned to a path power. When the LOS model is used, the AoD for the direct component is set equal to the line-of-sight path direction.\n\nStep 8: Randomly associate the multipath delays with AoDs.\n\nStep 9: Determine the powers, phases, and offset AoDs of the M = 20 sub-paths for each of the N paths at the BS. The offsets are given in Table 5.2, and the resulting per-path AS is 5 degrees instead of 2 degrees for the macrocell case.  The direct component, used with the LOS model will have no per-path AS.\n\nStep 10: Determine the AoAs for each of the multipath components. The AoAs are i.i.d Gaussian random variables\n\nwhere and  is the relative power of the nth path from Step 5.\n\nWhen the LOS model is used, the AoA for the direct component is set equal to the line-of-sight path direction.\n\nStep 11: Determine the offset AoAs of the M = 20 sub-paths for each of the N paths at the MS.\n\nStep 12: Associate the BS and MS paths and sub-paths.  Sub-paths are randomly paired for each path, and the sub-path phases defined at the BS and MS are maintained.\n\nStep 13: Determine the antenna gains of the BS and MS sub-paths as a function of their respective sub-path AoDs and AoAs.\n\nStep 14: Apply the path loss based on the BS to MS distance and the log normal shadow fading determined in Step 3 as bulk parameters to each of the sub-path powers of the channel model.\n\nThe values in Table 5.2 are selected to produce a biased standard deviation equal to 2, 5, and 35 degrees, which is equivalent to the per-path power weighted azimuth spread for equal power sub-paths.",

This is mainly designed to use LTE for M2M (Machine to Machine) or IoT (Internet of Things). Usually these application requires not that much throughput (in most case it needs very low throughput).\n\nWhy do you need this kind of special technique ? Does this mean that current LTE cannot achieve such a low throughput ?\n\nOf course there is no problem with the current LTE to work for such a low throughput application. But the issue is not with the low throughput, but with some other constraints. In practical point of view, this kind of application would need following characterstics.\n\nAs I said there is no problem with achieving Low Throughput with the current LTE implementation, but there would be limitation to achieve Low Cost, Low Energy Consumption as required in this area (Actually Low Throughput itself is not a goal of the design. It is more like a result of design/implementation that meets MTC criteria illustrated below.\n\nThen how to achieve these critical requirement. The easies way we can think of is to reduce the complexity of LTE and this is the main motivation of MTC and it is one of major topics in Rel 13. I think this would be more important feature/topic in 5G than in 4G (Current LTE).\n\nYou may say 'item i) and ii) has been supported from the day 1 of LTE. So we don't have to do anything (effort /changes) on network side ?'\n\nOnly in terms of throughput in a good signal condition, you may say like it. But with BW 1.4 and single antenna, it is very difficult to apply techniques to improve the reliable data connection (e.g, Spatial Diversity, Frequency Diversity etc). So we may need to change some specification to compensate this restriction.\n\nAlso, we may need to change some lower layer specification due to item iii) as well.\n\nAs of now (Apr 2015), no TS document yet, but you can get pretty details information from following documents.\n\nNow (as of Rel 13) we can see the real implementation of these criteria because LTE MTC specification is released. See how these general criteria turns into reality in LTE : LTE BL/CE (M1) and LTE NB pages.\n\n[2] TR 36.888 - Study on provision of low-cost Machine-Type Communications (MTC) User Equipments (UEs) based on LTE",

It is mainly for 5G Radio System. Even though no 3GPP specification about 5G is available, this project will contribute a lot in 5G community. Refer to OpenAirInterface home page for the details.\n\nOpenAirInterface (OAI) Software Alliance aims to further the software towards future 3GPP releases for 5G. The main goal of the alliance is to create an ecosystem of industrial/non-profit/academic organizations to implement reference solution for 3GPP standards. The OAI is striving to become a tool used by both the industry and academic for using community driven development to accelerate innovation in 5G wireless technologies, and to bring the huge economic success to this part of information technology. The OAI targets a reference implementation of Release 14 LTE based on the current 4G implementation and to progressively add enhancements from 3GPP study items defining the future 5G standard.\n\nOpenAirInterface is an open source implementation of 3GPP stack. It covers different parts of 3GPP stack (eNodeB, UE, MME, HSS, S-GW, P-GW). The software runs on general purpose computing platform (for ex. Intel/ARM) and interfaces with wide variety of SDR platforms (EXMIMO, USRP, BladeRF, LimeSDR).\n\nThe OAI currently implements Rel 8/10 stack for eNB/UE/EPC. It runs on standard Ubuntu Linux 14.04 LTS with low-latency kernel for eNB/UE. OAI requires Intel processors which support (SSE3/SSE4), however support for AVX2 is optional. It is also a requirement to have USB3/PCIe on a PC which interfaces with SDR platforms (USRP, BladeRF, EXMIMO and LimeSDR). The code compiles with standard GNU toolchain that comes with Linux. OAI can be also run in simulation mode (oaisim), the details of which are provided by Open Air Usage tutorials on the gitlab server@EURECOM.\n\nThe OAI software packages used to deploy an operators core network, the Enhanced Packet Core or EPC, are collectively known as openairCN while the access network software for base stations and terminals goes under the name of openair5G.\n\nThe EPC is quickly being integrated with other open source software packages providing telecommunication services and solutions for network management (e.g. openIMS, Clearwater IMS, OpenDayLight, Open Source MANO (OSM), OpNFV) on the generic cloud computing platform OpenStack. To ease integration with OpenStack software packages, and because revenues from the EPC are less dependent on intellectual property agreements, openairCN is distributed with a standard Apache V2.0 license, which is quite common in cloud computing software. The access network software openair5G, on the other hand, is freely distributed by the OAI under the terms stipulated by a new open source licence, the OAI Public License, catering to the intellectual property agreements used in 3GPP and allowing contributions from 3GPP members holding patents on key procedures used in the standard. The OAI is working closely with ETSI to harmonise the software licence with the intellectual property policy of 3GPP. The end result is that groups can use the software as any Apache V2.0 software for non-commercial purposes (e.g. for study and research) while for commercial exploitation of the community software, users are bound to respect intellectual property agreements associated with the 3GPP standard as with proprietary hardware and software. For details on OAI licensing model, please refer to OAI License Model page.\n\nSince, the evolution of 5G is still under discussion within academia/industry, we plan to identify different areas in which different members of the alliance create projects. The projects are created with the goal of furthering these strategic areas within the alliance and making sure the output of the project is merged back with the main repository at some point. The strategic areas of the alliance ratified by the board are listed here.\n\nIn order to install OAI successfully, it is important to follow HW/SW requirements. Almost all the technical documentation is hosted on EURECOM gitlab server. The entry point for wiki for openair5G is OAI Wiki/Home and the entry point for openairCN is OAI-CN Wiki/Home is here. There are several tutorials inside Gitlab page to run OAI in various modes (Emulation, Simulation, real-time with COTS UE, etc). The mailing lists for both user and developer community is OAI Wiki/Mailinglist. The gitlab workflow/coding guidelines/contributing guidelines are here.\n\nOAI hosts several training/workshops periodically for roadmap discussions with the community and also to train the community regarding the software implementation. For more information, refer to OAI Community/Workshop.\n\nThe Alliance offers several membership models for companies, non-profit institutions and individual contributors. The membership is free for individuals/non-profit organizations, however there is fee for corporations. For more info regarding membership, refer to OSA/JoinUs.\n\nQ2. Is there any operating system requirement ? (What type of linux ? what version ? etc) What is Operating System details that has been verified by OAI developers.\n\nQ4. What kind of hardware can be used to run OAI and what are those which has been verified by OAI developer ?\n\nQ4-1. Would OAI be runnable on USRP Embedded Sieries ? (Any verification activity done ?)\n\n[Ans] Yes, but we have not tried it. OAI needs to be ported to ZynQ to run on USRP Embedded series.\n\nQ4-2.There are many different series of USRP. Is there any specific series/model that is not usable for OAI ? (In terms of performance etc)\n\n[Ans] It is not recommended to use USRP N series as it is not able to do LTE sampling rate (30.72 for 20 MHz). In order to use USRP N-series, LTE sampling rate needs to be implemented in software on a PC\n\nQ5. Is there any additional libraries or tools that are required to OAI stack ?

This is mainly designed to use LTE for M2M (Machine to Machine) or IoT (Internet of Things). Usually these application requires not that much throughput (in most case it needs very low throughput).\n\nWhy do you need this kind of special technique ? Does this mean that current LTE cannot achieve such a low throughput ?\n\nOf course there is no problem with the current LTE to work for such a low throughput application. But the issue is not with the low throughput, but with some other constraints. In practical point of view, this kind of application would need following characterstics.\n\nAs I said there is no problem with achieving Low Throughput with the current LTE implementation, but there would be limitation to achieve Low Cost, Low Energy Consumption as required in this area (Actually Low Throughput itself is not a goal of the design. It is more like a result of design/implementation that meets MTC criteria illustrated below.\n\nThen how to achieve these critical requirement. The easies way we can think of is to reduce the complexity of LTE and this is the main motivation of MTC and it is one of major topics in Rel 13. I think this would be more important feature/topic in 5G than in 4G (Current LTE).\n\nYou may say 'item i) and ii) has been supported from the day 1 of LTE. So we don't have to do anything (effort /changes) on network side ?'\n\nOnly in terms of throughput in a good signal condition, you may say like it. But with BW 1.4 and single antenna, it is very difficult to apply techniques to improve the reliable data connection (e.g, Spatial Diversity, Frequency Diversity etc). So we may need to change some specification to compensate this restriction.\n\nAlso, we may need to change some lower layer specification due to item iii) as well.\n\nAs of now (Apr 2015), no TS document yet, but you can get pretty details information from following documents.\n\nNow (as of Rel 13) we can see the real implementation of these criteria because LTE MTC specification is released. See how these general criteria turns into reality in LTE : LTE BL/CE (M1) and LTE NB pages.\n\n[2] TR 36.888 - Study on provision of low-cost Machine-Type Communications (MTC) User Equipments (UEs) based on LTE",

I don't think it is complicated because UMTS MAC is doing more things than LTE MAC. (In terms of functionalility, I think LTE MAC is doing more than UMTS MAC). I think most of the complexity of UMTS MAC structure come from the design and the complexity of the transport channel.\nOften, things get very confusing and as a result log analysis/troubleshooting gets very tricky. Followins are the topics that will be covered in this page.\n\nAs you see in 25.321 - Figure 4.2.4.1 (Overview on MAC Layer in UTRAN), regardless of whether it is for R99, HSDPA(R5), HSUPA(R6), HSPA+ (R7), every MAC data goes through MAC-d sublayer somewhere along it's path. However the data flow within this sublayer differs among R99, R5, R6, R7 and differs depending on whether it is uplink (From UE to UTRAN) or downlink (From UTRAN to UE).\n\nTo help you understand the path for each case, I colored the figure from 25.321 according to each of the case.\n\nRed path represent the case for R99 and it applies to both Uplink and downlink. But when you want to follow the uplink path, you have to read the figure from bottom to top and for downlink you have to read from top to bottom. The important thing to remember is that for R99 MAC-d is a whole of MAC layer and the MAC flow does not go through any further processing.\n\nBlue path indicate the path for HSDPA(R5) and HSPA+(R7). As you see, the data for HSDPA, HSPA+ goes through MAC-d with a very little processing and are passed to MAC-hs (HSDPA) or MAC-ehs(HSPA+) for further detailed processing. You will go back to this processing later in this section.\n\nGreen path shows the path for HSUPA, meaning this is an uplink path. You have to follow from bottom (from the point labeled 'from MAC-es/MAC-is) to top.\n\nAs you see in Figure 4.2.3.1 (Overview on MAC Layer in UE), regardless of whether it is for R99, HSDPA(R5), HSUPA(R6), HSPA+ (R7), every MAC data goes through MAC-d sublayer somewhere along it's path.

You will go back to this processing later in this section.\n\nThe MAC PDU for R99 (marked in Red path) has following structure. (Note that this PDU applies only to R99 MAC PDU and does not apply to HSDPA, USUPA PDU. ) This is a generic format which contains all the possible fields in the header, but depending on logical channels and mapping type, the header structure gets different. We will see the details for each specific cases in next section.\n\nThe purpose of this field is to indicate the logical channel type (class) and meaning and number of bits for this field differs depending on the logical channel type. (Refer to Table 9.2.1.1, 9.2.1.2, 9.2.1.4 for the details. These tables are all from 3GPP 25.321)\n\nThis field indicate UE ID type. (There are only two UE types as shown in table 9.2.1.7)\n\nThis field indicate UE ID. The bit length of the ID differs depending on which UE-Id type is used in \"UE-id Type\" field.\n\nC/T field indicate the logical channel number for the PDU and the meaning of this value is listed in Table 9.2.1.5a.\n\nThe detailed value and meaning for each field are defined by various tables as shown below.\n\n< 25.321 - Table 9.2.1.1 : Coding of the Target Channel Type Field on FACH for TDD >\n\n< 25.321 - Table 9.2.1.2 : Coding of the Target Channel Type Field on FACH for FDD >\n\n< 25.321 - Table 9.2.1.4 : Coding of the Target Channel Type Field on RACH for FDD >\n\nMAC-d PDU structure takes various different form depending on the type of Logical channel and the mapping between the logical channel and transport channel. In this section, I will summarize the MAC PDU structures for all the possible combinations. These are based on 25.321 - 9.2.1 MAC PDU: Parameters of the MAC PDU header (not HS-DSCH or E-DCH) and MAC-d PDU header (HS-DSCH\nand E-DCH)\n\n- TCTF field, C/T field, UE-Id type field and UE-Id are included in the MAC header.

It is assumed that selection of a candidate MS has already taken place within the BSS based upon the criteria presented in clause 5. The exact algorithm, in the BSS, for determining a candidate MS is not addressed in the present document. The procedures discussed do not make use of the Mobile Application Part (MAP), represented by signalling function 4 in figure 2 and figure 3. The procedure described in this clause covers case i).\nThe successful operation of the procedure is as follows. When the BSS (BSS-A), currently supporting the MS, determines that the MS requires to be handed over it will send an AHANDOVER-REQUIRED message to the MSC (MSCA). The A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message shall contain a list of cells, or a single cell, to which the MS can be handed over. The list of cells shall be given in order of preference based upon operator determined criteria (These criteria are not addressed within the present document and are operator dependent). When the MSCA receives the A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message it shall begin the process of handing over the MS to a new BSS (BSS-B). (NOTE: BSS-A and BSS-B maybe the same BSS). The MSCA shall generate an A-HANDOVER-REQUEST message to the selected BSS (BSS-B). When BSS-B receives the AHANDOVER-REQUEST message it shall take the necessary action to allow the MS to access the radio resource of BSS-B, this is detailed in 3GPP TS 48.058 and in 3GPP TS 45.008. The switching of the radio resource through the necessary terrestrial resources is detailed in 3GPP TS 24.008 and 3GPP TS 48.008.\n\nOnce resource allocation has been completed by BSS-B it shall return an A-HANDOVER-REQUEST-ACK. to MSCA. When this message is received by MSCA it shall begin the process of instructing the MS to tune to a new dedicated radio resource. An A-HANDOVER-COMMAND will be sent by the MSCA to BSS-A. On receipt of the A-HANDOVER-COMMAND message BSS-A will send the radio interface message RI-HANDOVER-COMMAND, containing a Handover Reference number previously allocated by BSS-B, to the MS. The MS will then access the new radio resource using the Handover Reference number contained in the RI-HANDOVER-ACCESS message. The number will be checked by BSS-B to ensure it is as expected and the correct MS has been captured. If this is the correct MS then the BSS-B shall send an A-HANDOVER-DETECT to MSCA. When the MS is successfully communicating with the BSS-B a RI-HANDOVER-COMPLETE message will be sent by the MS to BSS-B. The BSS-B will then send an A-HANDOVER-COMPLETE message to MSCA.\n\nAfter MSCA has received the A-HANDOVER-COMPLETE message from BSS-B it shall begin to release the resources allocated on BSS-A. In figure 7 the resource is released by using the ACLEAR-COMMAND sequence.\nIn the case of ongoing GSM voice group calls the clearing of resources on BSS-A shall not be used if the resources are still be used on the down link.\nIf a failure occurs during the handover attempt, for example A-HANDOVER-FAILURE returned from BSS-A or BSS-B, then MSCA will terminate the handover to BSS-B. Under these conditions MSCA may optionally take one of a number of actions:\nThe exact action taken is dependent on whether the failure occurs before or after the A-HANDOVER-COMMAND has been sent.\nIn all cases the existing connection to the MS shall not be cleared except in the case of expiry of the timer for receipt of A-HANDOVER-COMPLETE.\n\nDuring the period that the MS is not in communication with the network MSCA shall queue all appropriate messages. All messages shall be delivered to the MS once communication is resumed . In the case of an Intra-MSC handover on MSCB then the messages shall be queued by MSCB.\nIn the case of ongoing GSM voice group calls if a failure occurs when handing over a user on a dedicated channel then the procedures described above may optionally be applied.\nFor the case of subsequent Inter-BSS Intra-MSC-B or Inter-BSS Intra-3G_MSC-B handover the following applies:\nIf handover to an A over IP capable BSS-B is performed, MSC-B/3G_MSC-B includes a Codec List (MSC preferred) in the A-HANDOVER-REQUEST message to BSS-B. MSC-B/3G_MSC-B may select the codecs for the Codec List (MSC preferred) from the channel type information and the AoIP-Supported Codecs List (Anchor), if this list was provided by MSC-A/3G_MSC-A in the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request. For a detailed description of the handling of these codec lists by MSC-A/3G_MSC-A and MSC-B/3G_MSC-B see 3GPP TS 23.153. If the AoIP-Supported Codecs List (Anchor) was not provided or MSCB/3G_MSC-B does not support the selection of codecs from the AoIP-Supported Codecs List (Anchor), then MSCB/3G_MSC-B shall create the Codec List (MSC preferred) using the channel type information received from MSCA/3G_MSC-A in the A-HANDOVER-REQUEST message included in the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request.\n\nAfter successful completion of the Intra-MSC-B handover or Intra-3G_MSC-B handover, if MSC-B/3G_MSC-B received the AoIP-Supported Codecs List (Anchor), MSC-B/3G_MSC-B may send the new AoIP-Selected Codec (Target) and AoIP-Available Codecs List (MAP) to MSC-A/3G_MSC-A in the MAP-PROCESS-ACCESS-SIGNALLING request transporting the AHANDOVER-PERFORMED message, if the following conditions are fulfilled: MSC-B/3G_MSC-B created a Codec List (MSC preferred) from the AoIP-Supported Codecs List (Anchor) received from MSC-A/3G_MSC-A, the target BSS-B uses A interface over IP and BSS-B does not insert a transcoder.",

Thus for the SCM channel generation steps given in Clause 5.3, Step 9 is replaced with steps 9a-d given below, which describe the AoAs of the paths arriving at the subscriber in the urban canyon scenario.\n\nThe following procedure is used to determine the subscriber mean AoAs of the six paths.  This model does not use a building grid, but assigns angles based on statistical data presented in the figures below.  The procedure is defined in terms of the subscriber terminal:\n\nStep 9a. Select a random street orientation from: U(0, 360˚) which also equals the direction of travel for the UE.\n\nStep 9b. Select a random orientation for the subscriber antenna array from U(0, 360).\n\nStep 9c. Given  the predefined fraction of UEs to experience the urban canyon effect, Select a uniform random draw for the parameter .\n\nStep 9d. If   select the UE AoAs for all arriving paths to be equal, with 50% probability of being from the direction of the street orientation obtained in step 9a, and 50% the street orientation plus an offset of 180.  If  select the directions of arrival for all paths using the standard SCM UE AoA model given in Clause 5.3, step 9.\n\nIn Figure 5.3, the urban canyon procedure is simulated to show the effects of the model on the composite UE angle spread.  The parameter , which describes the percentage of mobiles that will experience the urban canyon effects.  The figure illustrates the result of selecting the AoAs, where each of the paths has a fixed 35˚ angle spread.\n\nThe parameter , is set to a relatively high percentage of occurrence to emphasize the urban canyon effects, while the remaining occurrences assume some mixed arrivals to model various other conditions such as cross streets or where signals arrive from between buildings or from unknown paths at various angles.",

As in the link level simulations, the description is in the context of a downlink system where the BS transmits to a MS; however the material in this clause (with the exception of Clause 5.7 on Ioc modelling) can be applied to the uplink as well.\n\nAs opposed to link simulations which simply consider a single BS transmitting to a single MS, the system simulations typically consist of multiple cells/sectors, BSs, and MSs. Performance metrics such as throughput and delay are collected over D drops, where a \"drop\" is defined as a simulation run for a given number of cells/sectors, BSs, and MSs, over a specified number of frames. During a drop, the channel undergoes fast fading according to the motion of the MSs. Channel state information is fed back from the MSs to the BSs, and the BSs use schedulers to determine which user(s) to transmit to. Typically, over a series of D drops, the cell layout and locations of the BSs are fixed, but the locations of the MSs are randomly varied at the beginning of each drop. To simplify the simulation, only a subset of BSs will actually be simulated while the remaining BSs are assumed to transmit with full power.  The goal of this clause is to define the methodology and parameters for generating the spatial and temporal channel coefficients between a given base and mobile for use in system level simulations. For an S element BS array and a U element MS array, the channel coefficients for one of N multipath components (note that these components are not necessarily time resolvable, meaning that the time difference between successive paths may be less than a chip period) are given by an S -by- U  matrix of complex amplitudes. We denote the channel matrix for the nth multipath component (n = 1,…,N) as . It is a function of time t because the complex amplitudes are undergoing fast fading governed by the movement of the MS. The overall procedure for generating the channel matrices consists of three basic steps:\n\nClauses 5.2, 5.3, and 5.4 give the details for the general procedure. Figure 5.1 below provides a roadmap for generating the channel coefficients. Clause 5.5 specifies optional cases that modify the general procedure. Clause 5.6 describes the procedure for generating correlated log normal user parameters used in Clause 5.3. Clause 5.7 describes the method for accounting for intercell interference. Clause 5.8 presents calibration results.",

A slot transmission is simply a shortening of the current subframe transmission in half, while a subslot transmission consist of either a 2-symbol or a 3-symbol transmission duration.\n\nThe subslot division in a subframe is fixed in the UL while it varies depending on the first potential symbol for PDSCH in the DL, as shown in Figure 13.8-2. Each subframe is divided into up to 6 subslots. Subslot operation is not defined for lDataStart=4.\n\nThe slot operation is defined for both FS1 and FS2, while subslot operation is only defined for FS1. FS3 is not supported.\n\nThe combinations of slot and subslot operation on DL and UL are shown in Table 1. The asymmetric operation of subslot in DL and slot in UL is primarily allowed to improve coverage for the UL control channel.\n\nIn a carrier aggregation setting, an sTTI DL/UL combination is configured per component carrier (CC). A CA PUCCH group should have the same UL/DL sTTI configuration for the sTTI-configured SCells and the cell carrying PUCCH. However Different DL/UL sTTI lengths can be configured for the serving cells across different PUCCH groups. sTTI operation can also be configured in a DL only Scell. The maximum number of supported UL and DL sTTI carriers is the same as in 1 ms TTI operation. Cross-carrier scheduling is not supported for sTTI.\n\nThe physical channels for subslot and slot operation are given in Table 13.8-3.\n\nAs can be seen, although the transmission duration of the data channels (PDSCH/PUSCH) also follows the slot and subslot transmission duration, they are not defined as new physical channels. Except for some changes on the transport block size (TBS), resource allocation scheme and DL/UL UE-specific reference signal pattern, the main characteristics of the 1 ms data channels have been maintained. Both UL and DL control channels, on the other hand, have been significantly re-designed motivating to treat them as separate physical channels in the specification. SPUCCH follows subslot and slot duration (including also SR with a periodicity down to 1 subslot), while SPDCCH has either 1 os, 2 os or 3 os duration, transmitted at the start of each subslot/slot, and may span only configured frequency resources as illustrated in Figure 13.8-3.\n\nA fallback mode to 1 ms transmission is also supported for subslot and slot operation, the fallback is dynamic and can occur on a subframe to subframe basis. The UE needs to monitor both 1 ms and subslot/slot based control. Collision handling in case of simultaneous subslot/slot and subframe transmission in UL on the same CC has been specified to ensure a consistent UE behaviour.\n\nBoth CRS-based and DMRS-based demodulation is supported for SPDCCH and in case of CRS-based SPDCCH, the mapping of the SPDCCH can be configured to be either over 1 or 2 symbols in time (1 symbol illustrated above in Figure 3). In case of DMRS-based SPDCCH, the control is always mapped over 2 symbols for slot-based SPDCCH, while for subslot it aligns with the subslot duration (2 or 3 symbols).\n\nTo efficiently make use of the control resources not used in a subslot/slot, a re-use mechanism is specified to re-use the control region for data, illustrated in Figure 4. Both a semi-static and dynamic mechanism is specified. The efficiency of the re-use depends on the configuration (ideal re-use assumed in Figure 13.8-4).\n\nTo further minimize overhead, the DL DMRS can be shared between two consecutive subslots within a slot . The presence of the DL DMRS for PDSCH in subslot operation is indicated in the DL DCI (present or not). In UL the DMRS can be shared between all three subslots of a slot. The UL DMRS presence and position is indicated in the UL DCI. A possible configuration of the UL DMRS in a subframe that minimizes DMRS overhead is illustrated in Figure 13.8-5.\n\nThe specification also allows for DMRSs symbols to be shared between UEs in the UL, also referred to as DMRS multiplexing. In this case, an IFDMA based DMRS is typically used which allows users of different resource allocation to share the DMRS symbol by the use of different IFDMA combs, maintaining orthogonality between UEs.\n\nAs with short processing time for 1 ms, subslot/slot transmissions are associated with asynchronous HARQ operation on the UL. The processing time compared to regular 1 ms operation and the maximum timing advance are also reduced for both slot and subslot operation. In case of subslot operation, the UE can in its capability indicate the support of different processing timeline sets with associated maximum timing advance depending on the DL control channel configuration (DMRS-based SPDCCH, 1os CRS-based SPDCCH or 2os CRS-based SPDCCH). The processing timelines and associated maximum timing advance is summarized in Table 13.8-4. As can be seen, for each processing timeline set, there are two possible processing timelines (for example n+4 and n+6 for Set 1). Which one to use is under network control and configured by RRC (depending on the timing advance assigned to the UE).\n\nThe number of HARQ processes has been increased to 16 for slot/subslot operation and the HARQ processes can be shared between subslot/slot and 1 ms operation (with the restriction that the TBS and number of codewords limitations of subslot/slot need to be respected in case of initial transmission on 1 ms with a later retransmission on subslot/slot).\n\nA new set of DCI formats, named DCI format 7.x is associated with sTTI for slot and subslots scheduling. Among the specific features of these DCI formats, resource allocation has been modified to reflect the shorter TTI and therefore the granularity in RB allocation is increased.\n\nAdditional functionality also specified in the feature is sTTI specific aperiodic CSI reporting which includes measuring on a slot/subslot CSI reference resource as well as faster triggering and faster processing time for the CSI to be reported. Periodic CSI reporting is not supported.\n\nAlso, semi-persistent scheduling is specified for sTTI with similar functionality as in legacy operation. A contention based SPS operation is allowed where different UEs can be assigned different cyclic shifts and IFDMA combs for the DMRS, but fully/partially overlapping resource allocation.\n\nReferences",

The MICH is always associated with an S-CCPCH to which a FACH transport channel is mapped.\n\nFigure 26D illustrates the frame structure of the MICH. One MICH radio frame of length 10 ms consists of 300 bits (b0, b1, …, b299). Of these, 288 bits (b0, b1, …, b287) are used to carry notification indicators. The remaining 12 bits are not formally part of the MICH and shall not be transmitted (DTX).\n\nIn each MICH frame, Nn notification indicators {N0, …, NNn-1} are transmitted, where Nn=18, 36, 72, or 144.\n\nThe NI calculated by higher layers is associated to the index q of the notification indicator Nq, where q is computed as a function of the NI computed by higher layers, the SFN of the P-CCPCH radio frame during which the start of the MICH radio frame occurs, and the number of notification indicators per frame (Nn):\n\nwhere G = 216 , C = 25033 and NI is the 16 bit Notification Indicator calculated by higher layers.\n\nThe set of NI signalled over Iub indicates all higher layer NI values for which the associated notification indicator on MICH shall be set to 1 during the corresponding modification period. Hence, the calculation in the formula above shall be performed in the Node B every MICH frame for each NI signalled over Iub to make the association between NI and q and set the related Nq to 1. All other notification indicators on MICH shall be set to 0.\n\nThe mapping from {N0, …, NNn-1} to the MICH bits {b0, …, b287} are according to table 27.\n\nWhen transmit diversity is employed for the MICH, STTD encoding is used on the MICH bits as described in subclause 5.3.1.1.1.",

The architecture and radio parts of NSA are reminded in the Figure below.\n\nThe eNB is the master node (MN) while the en-gNB is the secondary node (SN).\n\nThe E-UTRAN uses the per-UE information supplied by the MME and local E-UTRAN configuration data to determine whether or not to use Dual Connectivity for that UE. On a per-EPS bearer (4G bearer) basis, the E-UTRAN decides whether to use a Master Cell Group bearer or a Secondary Cell Group bearer, and, whether or not that bearer is a split bearer, as defined in the section on the NSA Access Network.\n\nFor example, the Master eNB can decide to use the 5G en-gNB for user data (the \"Internet\" PDN connection), as to enjoy the 5G \"high capacity\" aspect, and to use the 4G eNB for IMS Signalling and IMS voice, as to enjoy the 4G \"robust coverage layer\" aspect.\n\nThe following figures illustrate some of the alternative configurations in the context of a Master Cell Group (MCG) and a Secondary Cell Group (SCG) respectively. Note that, as in the above example, one UE can use these configurations simultaneously. Also note that, in general, the EPC has no concrete information about whether the E-UTRAN is using Dual Connectivity, nor what configuration of Dual Connectivity is in use.\n\nNote that it is also possible to operate NSA with an unmodified pre-Release 15 EPC (4G CN). In order to support the SCG bearer, the EPC does however need to support the Release 12 Dual Connectivity feature.\n\nSeveral features have been introduced to enhance the functionality of the EPC for use with NR:\n\nWithin SA3, the security aspects were examined and CRs were generated that enabled the existing EPS security algorithms to be reused for signalling confidentiality and integrity protection, and, user plane confidentiality.",

In that case the codec bit rate is reduced so that more throughput is left on the radio interface to add protection. The principle when TFO is active is that as soon as one side detects the need to downgrade the codec rate, it informs the other side and the codec mode is immediately downgraded. There is no negotiation before downgrading.\n\nC.1.1\tUplink downgrading\n\nThe following figure shows the uplink adaptation due to detection by the BTS1 of a bad quality in the uplink from the MS1. In that case the round trip delay between BTS1 and BTS2 has no impact, as the uplink codec adaptation is decided immediately by BTS1 and performed by the MS1.\n\nC.1.2\tDownlink downgrading\n\nThe following figure C.1.2 shows the downlink adaptation due to detection by the MS1 of a bad quality of the downlink from the BTS1. The codec mode adaptation must be performed on the far end MS (MS2), where the source encoder is located. In that case the round trip delay before the downlink adaptation is effective has an high impact. If TFO would not be active, the round trip delay would be smaller, because the Codec Mode Request sent by the BTS1 to the TRAU1 would be immediately taken into account by the TRAU1 and the new codec mode applied in downlink: without TFO ongoing the (tandem) source encoder is located in TRAU1.",

General concepts about transport channels are described in [12].\n\nA transport channel is defined by how and with what characteristics data is transferred over the air interface. A general classification of transport channels is into two groups:\n\n4.1.1\tDedicated transport channels\n\nThere exists two types of dedicated transport channel, the Dedicated Channel (DCH) and the Enhanced Dedicated Channel (E-DCH).\n\n4.1.1.1\tDCH - Dedicated Channel\n\nThe Dedicated Channel (DCH) is a downlink or uplink transport channel. The DCH is transmitted over the entire cell or over only a part of the cell using e.g. beam-forming antennas.\n\n4.1.1.2\tE-DCH - Enhanced Dedicated Channel\n\nThe Enhanced Dedicated Channel (E-DCH) is an uplink transport channel in CELL DCH.\n\n4.1.2\tCommon transport channels\n\nThere are six types of common transport channels: BCH, FACH, PCH, RACH, HS-DSCH and E-DCH.\n\n4.1.2.1\tBCH - Broadcast Channel\n\nThe Broadcast Channel (BCH) is a downlink transport channel that is used to broadcast system- and cell-specific information. The BCH is always transmitted over the entire cell and has a single non-zero transport format. In cells configured with broadcast distribution, a first BCH mapped to P-CCPCH is always present and one additional BCH mapped to S-CCPCH can be configured.\n\n4.1.2.2\tFACH - Forward Access Channel\n\nThe Forward Access Channel (FACH) is a downlink transport channel. The FACH is transmitted over the entire cell. The FACH can be transmitted using power setting described in [16].\n\n4.1.2.3\tPCH - Paging Channel\n\nThe Paging Channel (PCH) is a downlink transport channel. The PCH is always transmitted over the entire cell. The transmission of the PCH is associated with the transmission of physical-layer generated Paging Indicators, to support efficient sleep-mode procedures.\n\n4.1.2.4\tRACH - Random Access Channel\n\nThe Random Access Channel (RACH) is an uplink transport channel. The RACH is always received from the entire cell. The RACH is characterized by a collision risk and by being transmitted using open loop power control.\n\n4.1.2.7\tHS-DSCH - High Speed Downlink Shared Channel\n\nThe High Speed Downlink Shared Channel is a downlink transport channel shared by several UEs. The HS-DSCH can be associated with one downlink DPCH or F-DPCH, and one or several Shared Control Channels (HS-SCCH). The HS-DSCH is transmitted over the entire cell or over only part of the cell using e.g. beam-forming antennas.\n\n4.1.2.7A\tE-DCH - Enhanced Dedicated Channel\n\nThe Enhanced Dedicated Channel (E-DCH) is an uplink transport channel in CELL_FACH state and IDLE mode.\n\n4.2\tIndicators\n\nIndicators are means of fast low-level signalling entities which are transmitted without using information blocks sent over transport channels. The meaning of indicators is specific to the type of indicator.\n\nThe indicators defined in the current version of the specifications are: Acquisition Indicator (AI), Page Indicator (PI) and MBMS Notification Indicator (NI).\n\nIndicators may be either boolean (two-valued) or three-valued. Their mapping to indicator channels is channel specific.\n\nIndicators are transmitted on those physical channels that are indicator channels (ICH).",

If the \"priority\" indicator is not set then the trace records shall stored within the local filestore and subsequently transferred to the OSF in bulk via FTAM.\n\nIf a trace is activated with the \"priority\" indicator set then the trace records shall be sent to the OSF either direct by the trace control function or through Event Forwarding Discriminators (EFDs).\n\nIf EFDs are used then all trace records are offered to the EFDs. The EFDs determine which of the records are to be transmitted to the OSF in the form of event reports and the Operation System Id field in the header is ignored. The EDFs have complex filter constructs, which allow the operator to define the criteria for destinations and filters.\n\nIf EFDs are not used then all priority records are forwarded to the OSF whose address is given in the Operation System Id field. The NEF is required to supply additional information to provide the OS management application entity title.\n\nFinally, the trace records may also be stored in the form of log entries within the log of the NEF. It is up to the operator to decide if the log function is needed in parallel with the event reporting and file store. Once stored, the log records may be individually accessed by the OSF via the appropriate object management functions. Care should be taken of filter criteria for log records to avoid unnecessary overheads.\n\nThis service component contains the following groups of TMN management functions:\n\n9.2\tTransfer of Records\n\n9.2.1\tBulk record transfer\n\nThis group of TMN functions is concerned with the bulk transfer of trace records from the NEF record filestore to the OSF.\n\nThe trace records shall be transferred from the NEF to the OSF by the use of FTAM services. For further details of the use of FTAM see GSM 12.01 [8].\n\nIn addition to the simple file transfer services provided by FTAM, peertopeer application process communication may also be supported. The use of CMIS services for the uploading of files from the NEF to the OSF is specified in the GSM 12.00 [7].\n\nWhen the procedure defined in GSM 12.00 [7] and GSM 12.01 [8] are used to transfer the trace records, the file type shall be traceRecords and the format of the file is given by the type TraceFileFormat.\n\n9.2.2\tLog control\n\nThis function permits the trace record to be stored and retrieved from logs within the NEF. The logging of these records is performed in accordance with the log control function specified in CCITT X.735 [15] and no additional management functions are required.\n\n9.2.3\tLog access\n\nThis TMN function controls the access to the log described above. Each log defined may contain one or more log entries. Each log entry contains a single trace record.\n\nFor further details concerning the use of logs, see CCITT X.735 [15].\n\nThe following system management functions are required:\n\n9.2.4\tEvent Reporting\n\n9.2.4.1\tEvent Forwarding Discriminators\n\nFor shortterm recording of tracing events and for more complicated filter conditions the event forwarding discriminator construct defined in CCITT X.734 [14] and CCITT X.721 [13] can be employed. The event forwarding discriminator construct is extremely flexible permitting the combination of a number of fields and logical operations with a wide variety of scheduling options. The EFD also controls the destinations to which the event reports are sent. Several such filters may be defined and scheduled for operation at different times and for different time periods.\n\nThe following system management functions are required:\n\n9.2.4.2\tDirect Transfer by Trace Control Function\n\nThis function permits the NEF to transmit trace records direct to the OSF. In general the trace record shall be sent on completion of the call or the traceable event. This function is controlled by means of the \"priority\" indicator, which is contained in the trace type. If the priority indicator is not set, then the trace records shall be stored on file within the NE filestore. These records may be subsequently collected via bulk record transfer as described in subclause 9.2.1. If the trace type specified on activation includes the \"priority\" indicator then all of the records shall be sent via trace reports to the OSF specified by the operation system id.\n\nThe following system management functions are required:",

They use the functions and services provided by layer 2 defined in 3GPP TS 44.005 and 3GPP TS 44.006. 3GPP TS 24.007 gives the general description of layer 3 including procedures, messages format and error handling.\n1.3\tStructure of layer 3 procedures\nA building block method is used to describe the layer 3 procedures.\nThe basic building blocks are \"elementary procedures\" provided by the protocol control entities of the three sublayers, i.e. radio resource management, mobility management and connection management sublayer.\nComplete layer 3 transactions consist of specific sequences of elementary procedures. The term \"structured procedure\" is used for these sequences.\n1.4\tTest procedures\nTest procedures of the GSM radio interface signalling are described in 3GPP TS 51.010 and 3GPP TS 51.02x series.\n\n1.5\tUse of logical channels\nThe logical control channels are defined in 3GPP TS 45.002. In the following those control channels are considered which carry signalling information or specific types of user packet information:\nTwo service access points are defined on signalling layer 2 which are discriminated by their Service Access Point Identifiers (SAPI) (see 3GPP TS 44.006):\nLayer 3 selects the service access point, the logical control channel and the mode of operation of layer 2 (acknowledged, unacknowledged or random access, see 3GPP TS 44.005 and 3GPP TS 44.006) as required for each individual message.\n1.6\tOverview of control procedures\n1.6.1\tList of procedures\nThe following procedures are specified in the Technical Specification:\nThe elementary procedures can be combined to form structured procedures. Examples of such structured procedures are given in clause 7. This part of the Technical Specification is only provided for guidance to assist implementations.\n\nClause 8 specifies actions to be taken on various error conditions and also provides rules to ensure compatibility with future enhancements of the protocol.\n1.7\tApplicability of implementations\nThe applicability of procedures of this technical specification for the mobile station is dependent on the services and functions which are to be supported by a mobile station.\n1.7.1\tVoice Group Call Service (VGCS) and Voice Broadcast Service (VBS)\nFor mobile stations supporting the Voice Group Call Service or the Voice Broadcast Service, it is explicitly mentioned throughout this technical specification if a certain procedure is applicable only for such a service and, if necessary, how mobile stations not supporting such a service shall behave.\nFor VGCS and VBS, the following possible mobile station implementations exist:\n\nApart from the explicitly mentioned combinations, all possible combinations are optional and supported by this technical specification.\nThe related terms are used in this technical specification, if information on these implementation options is required.\n1.7.2\tGeneral Packet Radio Service (GPRS)\nFor mobile stations supporting the General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), it is explicitly mentioned throughout the technical specification if a certain procedure is applicable only for such a service and, if necessary, how mobile stations not supporting such a service shall behave.\nA GPRS MS may operate in one of the following MS operation modes, see 3GPP TS 23.060:\nThe MS operation mode depends on the services that the MS is attached to, i.e., only GPRS or both GPRS and non-GPRS services, and upon the MS's capabilities to operate GPRS and other GSM services simultaneously. Mobile stations that are capable to operate GPRS services are referred to as GPRS MSs.\n\nIt should be noted that it is possible that for a GPRS MS, the GMM procedures currently described in the ETS do not support combinations of VGCS, VBS and GPRS.

The enhancements included the addition of two reporting events - H1 (above) and H2 (below) UE height thresholds - to help the eNodeB to see the UAV and to deal with any potential interference. Other measures for signaling and to reduce interference by the UAV were also added.\n\nRelease 16 - Remote Identification of Unmanned Aerial Systems (TS 22.125, Section 5)\n\n3GPP SA1 has completed a study into the potential requirements and use cases for remote identification and on the services to be offered based on remote identification of the UAS.\nRelease 17 - Study on supporting Unmanned Aerial Systems Connectivity, Identification, and Tracking (TR 23.754)\n\nLooking at the architecture and system aspects of command and control functions, having identified the UAS, this study looks at the extent to which the 3GPP system can enable UAS components to establish the necessary connectivity between each other and UAS Traffic Management (UTM) - for both line of sight connectivity and non-line of sight connectivity, and on the detection and reporting of unauthorized UAVs towards the UTM.\n\nThe App. dedicated group - 3GPP SA6 - are studying the use cases and requirements (from 3GPP SA1) regarding UAS identification and tracking. Taking the service requirements resulting from TS 22.125 - SA6 is now looking at the potential impact on the application layer, in particular the application support/enabler functionalities for UTM and the service interactions between UAS and the UTM (e.g. fly route authorization, location management, group communication support).\n\nThe group is considering architectures and solutions already developed for mission critical and V2X services, for re-use in aerial systems (See 3GPP SP-181252).\n\nTo further meet the needs of 5G connectivity of drones - this work will produce new KPIs and communication needs of the UAV with a 3GPP subscription. Specifically, requirements relating to the following will be documented: KPIs based on communication service, KPIs for command and control traffic, On-board radio access node (UxNB), service restriction for UAV, Network exposure for the UAV.\n\nUp-to-date information on all of the above work can be found in the 3GPP Work Plan.\n\nSee also: Service requirements for next generation new services and markets (TS 22.261)",

For each DCI format, frequency-domain and time-domain resource allocation fields are included. For frequency-domain resource allocation, resource block group (RBG)-level bit-map resource allocation (resource allocation Type 0) and contiguous resource allocation (resource allocation Type1) are supported. A UE can be configured with either or both of them. For time-domain resource allocation, the time-domain resource allocation field in the DCI jointly indicates scheduled slot, starting symbol, and the duration (number of consecutive symbols to use for the channel).\n\nFor PUSCH and PDSCH, other than DCI-based scheduling, configured grant for PUSCH and semi-persistent scheduling (SPS) for PDSCH are supported. For configured grant PUSCH, once PUSCH resource is configured and activated, the UE can transmit a PUSCH without DCI format 0_0/0_1. There are two types of configured grant PUSCH; with the configured grant Type1, UE can transmit PUSCH on the configured grant resource once RRC configuration is available, while with the configured grant Type2, UE can transmit PUSCH on the configured grant resource after a DCI with CRC scrambled by CS-RNTI activates the configured grant resource. SPS for PDSCH also requires activation DCI with CRC scrambled by CS-RNTI.\n\nFor NR, only asynchronous and adaptive HARQ is supported for both PDSCH and PUSCH. A PDSCH or PUSCH can be re-transmitted at any timing and with any transmission configuration. For re-transmission of a PDSCH or PUSCH, DCI formats 0_0/0_1 or 1_0/1_1 is used. HARQ process number and redundancy version are indicated in the DCI scheduling the re-transmission. Initial transmission/retransmission of a TB and soft-buffer store/flush are controlled per HARQ process number. Redundancy version is used to control redundancy of channel coded bits.\n\nUE reports HARQ-ACK feedback for a decoded PDSCH. UE can be configured with reporting one HARQ-ACK bit for each transport block (TB), while if a UE is configured with CBG-based PDSCH transmission, the UE reports one HARQ-ACK bit for each code block group (CBG). A CBG is a group of code-blocks consisting of a TB, where channel coding is applied for each code block. If a UE is configured with CBG-based PDSCH transmission, the DCI scheduling PDSCH includes CBG transmission information (CBGTI) field which indicates which CBG(s) is/are re-transmitted, and the DCI can also include CBG flushing out information (CBGFI) field, which indicates the CBGs being retransmitted can be combined with the earlier received instances of the same CBGs. For PUSCH, CBG-based transmission using CBGTI is also supported.\n\nFor reporting multiple HARQ-ACK bits at one time, two types of HARQ-ACK codebook construction are supported; Type 1 HARQ-ACK codebook constructs the codebook based on semi-static configuration only, where HARQ-ACK bits corresponding to all of the possible PDSCHs based on the configuration are contained. Type 2 HARQ-ACK codebook constructs the codebook based on both semi-static configuration and DCI field named downlink assignment index (DAI), where HARQ-ACK bits corresponding to PDSCHs assumed to be assigned are contained.",

All features are optional for the UE and can be supported by Cat-M1 and Cat-M2 and by normal LTE UEs supporting CE mode unless otherwise stated. All features are applicable to both CE modes (A and B) in all duplex modes (HD-FDD, FD-FDD, and TDD) unless otherwise stated.\n\n7.3.1\tSupport for new use cases\n\nThe MTC features introduced in LTE Rel-13 focused on applications with relatively modest requirements in terms of data rates, latency, mobility, etc. The range of use cases that can be addressed was extended in Rel-14 by improving the support for higher data rates, multicast, positioning, VoLTE, and mobility measurements. This work item introduces the following additional enhancements for support of new use cases.\n\n7.3.2\tReduced latency\n\nReduced latency is achieved by the improvements for reduced system acquisition time listed in this section. Furthermore, note that the EDT feature and the HARQ feedback feature listed in the next clause may also help reduce latency.\n\n7.3.3\tReduced UE power consumption\n\nReduced UE power consumption is achieved through reduced downlink monitoring, reduced signalling and reduced uplink transmission by the features listed in this section. Furthermore, note that the features for reduced system acquisition time listed in the previous clause and the uplink sub-PRB allocation feature mentioned in the next clause may also help reduce power consumption.\n\n7.3.4\tIncreased spectral efficiency\n\nIncreased spectral efficiency is achieved through higher order modulation, more efficient resource allocation and reduced inter-cell interference by the features listed in this section. Furthermore, note that the EDT feature described in the previous clause may also help increase spectral efficiency.\n\n7.3.5\tImproved access control\n\nThe legacy access barring mechanisms (ACB and EAB) do not distinguish between different coverage enhancement (CE) levels. In high load situations, it may be desired to temporarily bar access e.g. to the highest CE levels, since UEs in high CE levels may be associated with higher resource consumption due to dozens, hundreds or even thousands of repetitions.\n\nReferences",

It is assumed that selection of a candidate MS has already taken place within the BSS based upon the criteria presented in clause 5. The exact algorithm, in the BSS, for determining a candidate MS is not addressed in the present document. The procedures discussed do not make use of the Mobile Application Part (MAP), represented by signalling function 4 in figure 2 and figure 3. The procedure described in this clause covers case i).\nThe successful operation of the procedure is as follows. When the BSS (BSS-A), currently supporting the MS, determines that the MS requires to be handed over it will send an AHANDOVER-REQUIRED message to the MSC (MSCA). The A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message shall contain a list of cells, or a single cell, to which the MS can be handed over. The list of cells shall be given in order of preference based upon operator determined criteria (These criteria are not addressed within the present document and are operator dependent). When the MSCA receives the A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message it shall begin the process of handing over the MS to a new BSS (BSS-B). (NOTE: BSS-A and BSS-B maybe the same BSS). The MSCA shall generate an A-HANDOVER-REQUEST message to the selected BSS (BSS-B). When BSS-B receives the AHANDOVER-REQUEST message it shall take the necessary action to allow the MS to access the radio resource of BSS-B, this is detailed in 3GPP TS 48.058 and in 3GPP TS 45.008. The switching of the radio resource through the necessary terrestrial resources is detailed in 3GPP TS 24.008 and 3GPP TS 48.008.\n\nOnce resource allocation has been completed by BSS-B it shall return an A-HANDOVER-REQUEST-ACK. to MSCA. When this message is received by MSCA it shall begin the process of instructing the MS to tune to a new dedicated radio resource. An A-HANDOVER-COMMAND will be sent by the MSCA to BSS-A. On receipt of the A-HANDOVER-COMMAND message BSS-A will send the radio interface message RI-HANDOVER-COMMAND, containing a Handover Reference number previously allocated by BSS-B, to the MS. The MS will then access the new radio resource using the Handover Reference number contained in the RI-HANDOVER-ACCESS message. The number will be checked by BSS-B to ensure it is as expected and the correct MS has been captured. If this is the correct MS then the BSS-B shall send an A-HANDOVER-DETECT to MSCA. When the MS is successfully communicating with the BSS-B a RI-HANDOVER-COMPLETE message will be sent by the MS to BSS-B. The BSS-B will then send an A-HANDOVER-COMPLETE message to MSCA.\n\nAfter MSCA has received the A-HANDOVER-COMPLETE message from BSS-B it shall begin to release the resources allocated on BSS-A. In figure 7 the resource is released by using the ACLEAR-COMMAND sequence.\nIn the case of ongoing GSM voice group calls the clearing of resources on BSS-A shall not be used if the resources are still be used on the down link.\nIf a failure occurs during the handover attempt, for example A-HANDOVER-FAILURE returned from BSS-A or BSS-B, then MSCA will terminate the handover to BSS-B. Under these conditions MSCA may optionally take one of a number of actions:\nThe exact action taken is dependent on whether the failure occurs before or after the A-HANDOVER-COMMAND has been sent.\nIn all cases the existing connection to the MS shall not be cleared except in the case of expiry of the timer for receipt of A-HANDOVER-COMPLETE.\n\nDuring the period that the MS is not in communication with the network MSCA shall queue all appropriate messages. All messages shall be delivered to the MS once communication is resumed . In the case of an Intra-MSC handover on MSCB then the messages shall be queued by MSCB.\nIn the case of ongoing GSM voice group calls if a failure occurs when handing over a user on a dedicated channel then the procedures described above may optionally be applied.\nFor the case of subsequent Inter-BSS Intra-MSC-B or Inter-BSS Intra-3G_MSC-B handover the following applies:\nIf handover to an A over IP capable BSS-B is performed, MSC-B/3G_MSC-B includes a Codec List (MSC preferred) in the A-HANDOVER-REQUEST message to BSS-B. MSC-B/3G_MSC-B may select the codecs for the Codec List (MSC preferred) from the channel type information and the AoIP-Supported Codecs List (Anchor), if this list was provided by MSC-A/3G_MSC-A in the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request. For a detailed description of the handling of these codec lists by MSC-A/3G_MSC-A and MSC-B/3G_MSC-B see 3GPP TS 23.153. If the AoIP-Supported Codecs List (Anchor) was not provided or MSCB/3G_MSC-B does not support the selection of codecs from the AoIP-Supported Codecs List (Anchor), then MSCB/3G_MSC-B shall create the Codec List (MSC preferred) using the channel type information received from MSCA/3G_MSC-A in the A-HANDOVER-REQUEST message included in the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request.\n\nAfter successful completion of the Intra-MSC-B handover or Intra-3G_MSC-B handover, if MSC-B/3G_MSC-B received the AoIP-Supported Codecs List (Anchor), MSC-B/3G_MSC-B may send the new AoIP-Selected Codec (Target) and AoIP-Available Codecs List (MAP) to MSC-A/3G_MSC-A in the MAP-PROCESS-ACCESS-SIGNALLING request transporting the AHANDOVER-PERFORMED message, if the following conditions are fulfilled: MSC-B/3G_MSC-B created a Codec List (MSC preferred) from the AoIP-Supported Codecs List (Anchor) received from MSC-A/3G_MSC-A, the target BSS-B uses A interface over IP and BSS-B does not insert a transcoder.",

This service component controls the transfer of the trace records from the NEFs to the OSF. The conceptual model is illustrated in figure 5, which employs both the event report function (CCITT X.734 [14]) and the log control function (CCITT X.735 [15]).\n\nThe trace control function collects traceable events within the NEF and formats them into trace records. These trace records may be stored locally within the NEF filestore or transferred to the OSF in the form of event reports. This is controlled by means of the \"priority\" indicator, which is a part of the trace type. If the \"priority\" indicator is not set then the trace records shall stored within the local filestore and subsequently transferred to the OSF in bulk via FTAM.\n\nIf a trace is activated with the \"priority\" indicator set then the trace records shall be sent to the OSF either direct by the trace control function or through Event Forwarding Discriminators (EFDs).\n\nIf EFDs are used then all trace records are offered to the EFDs. The EFDs determine which of the records are to be transmitted to the OSF in the form of event reports and the Operation System Id field in the header is ignored. The EDFs have complex filter constructs, which allow the operator to define the criteria for destinations and filters.\n\nIf EFDs are not used then all priority records are forwarded to the OSF whose address is given in the Operation System Id field. The NEF is required to supply additional information to provide the OS management application entity title.\n\nFinally, the trace records may also be stored in the form of log entries within the log of the NEF. It is up to the operator to decide if the log function is needed in parallel with the event reporting and file store. Once stored, the log records may be individually accessed by the OSF via the appropriate object management functions. Care should be taken of filter criteria for log records to avoid unnecessary overheads.\n\nThis service component contains the following groups of TMN management functions:\n\n9.2\tTransfer of Records\n\n9.2.1\tBulk record transfer\n\nThis group of TMN functions is concerned with the bulk transfer of trace records from the NEF record filestore to the OSF.\n\nThe trace records shall be transferred from the NEF to the OSF by the use of FTAM services. For further details of the use of FTAM see GSM 12.01 [8].\n\nIn addition to the simple file transfer services provided by FTAM, peertopeer application process communication may also be supported. The use of CMIS services for the uploading of files from the NEF to the OSF is specified in the GSM 12.00 [7].\n\nWhen the procedure defined in GSM 12.00 [7] and GSM 12.01 [8] are used to transfer the trace records, the file type shall be traceRecords and the format of the file is given by the type TraceFileFormat.\n\n9.2.2\tLog control\n\nThis function permits the trace record to be stored and retrieved from logs within the NEF. The logging of these records is performed in accordance with the log control function specified in CCITT X.735 [15] and no additional management functions are required.\n\n9.2.3\tLog access\n\nThis TMN function controls the access to the log described above. Each log defined may contain one or more log entries. Each log entry contains a single trace record.\n\nFor further details concerning the use of logs, see CCITT X.735 [15].\n\nThe following system management functions are required:\n\n9.2.4\tEvent Reporting\n\n9.2.4.1\tEvent Forwarding Discriminators\n\nFor shortterm recording of tracing events and for more complicated filter conditions the event forwarding discriminator construct defined in CCITT X.734 [14] and CCITT X.721 [13] can be employed. The event forwarding discriminator construct is extremely flexible permitting the combination of a number of fields and logical operations with a wide variety of scheduling options. The EFD also controls the destinations to which the event reports are sent. Several such filters may be defined and scheduled for operation at different times and for different time periods.\n\nThe following system management functions are required:\n\n9.2.4.2\tDirect Transfer by Trace Control Function\n\nThis function permits the NEF to transmit trace records direct to the OSF. In general the trace record shall be sent on completion of the call or the traceable event. This function is controlled by means of the \"priority\" indicator, which is contained in the trace type. If the priority indicator is not set, then the trace records shall be stored on file within the NE filestore. These records may be subsequently collected via bulk record transfer as described in subclause 9.2.1. If the trace type specified on activation includes the \"priority\" indicator then all of the records shall be sent via trace reports to the OSF specified by the operation system id.\n\nThe following system management functions are required:",

If the UICC is removed from the 3G terminal, the service shall be terminated immediately. The functions of the USIM include authenticating itself to the network and vice versa, authenticating the user and providing additional security functions as defined in 3GPP TS 33.102 [7].\n\nThe USIM shall be unambiguously identified.\n\nMeans shall be provided to prevent fraudulent use of stolen UICCs.\n\nIt shall not be possible to access data intended for USIM internal use, e.g. authentication keys.\n\nFurther details of the following requirements are given in 3GPP TS 33.102 [7].\n\n5.1\tFile access conditions\n\nActions, such as READ, UPDATE on UICC data shall be controlled by access conditions. These shall be satisfied prior to the action being performed.\n\nSince a UICC may contain multiple (3G and non-3G) applications, a flexible method of controlling file access shall be provided.\n\n5.2\tUser authentication\n\nThe USIM shall support means to authenticate the user, to provide, for example, protection against the use of stolen cards. For the USIM, authentication shall be performed by the verification of a numeric PIN of four (4) to eight (8) decimal digits.\n\nA function to disable user authentication may exist which may be inhibited by the application provider, in which case the user shall always use the PIN. Otherwise, the user may decide whether or not to make use of the user authentication function. If disabled, the user authentication function remains disabled until the user specifically re-enables it.\n\nFollowing correct PIN presentation, the ME may perform functions and actions on USIM data, which are protected by the relevant access condition.\n\nIf an incorrect PIN is entered, an indication shall be given to the user. After three (3) consecutive incorrect entries the relevant PIN is blocked, i.e. functions and actions on data protected by the access condition shall no longer be possible, even if between attempts the UICC has been removed, the USIM has been deselected or the ME has been switched off. Once a PIN is blocked, further PIN verifications shall be denied.\n\nThe USIM shall support a mechanism for unblocking a blocked PIN. Unblocking of a PIN is performed by using the relevant PIN Unblocking Key.\n\nPINs, but not Unblock PINs, shall be changeable by the user following correct entry of either the current PIN or Unblock PIN.\n\nThe Unblock PIN shall consist of eight (8) decimal digits and shall not be changeable by the user. If an incorrect Unblock PIN is presented, an indication shall be given to the user. After ten (10) consecutive incorrect entries, the Unblock PIN shall be blocked, even if between attempts the UICC has been removed, the USIM has been deselected or the ME has been switched off. Unblocking of a blocked PIN shall not be possible.\n\nIt shall not be possible to read PINs or Unblock PINs.\n\n5.3\tUser data stored in ME\n\nSubject to the exception below, all user related information transferred into the ME during network operations shall be deleted from the ME after removal of the UICC, deselection of the USIM, deactivation of the ME, or following an electrical reset of the UICC. This includes any data that was transferred to the ME by USIM Application Toolkit commands.\n\nUser related security codes such as PIN and Unblock PIN may only be stored by the ME during the procedures involving such a code and shall be discarded by the ME immediately after completion of the procedure.\n\nOptionally, an ME may retain some less security-sensitive data at UICC removal, USIM deselection or ME switch-off. Such data are e.g. SMS, ADN/SSC, FDN/SSC, LND. These data, when stored in the ME, shall only be readable/retrievable if the same USIM is reactivated (as determined by the IMSI). If the IMSI is retained in the ME for this purpose, it shall be stored securely and shall not be able to be read out.\n\n5.4\tAuthentication\n\nA means shall be specified to mutually authenticate the USIM and the network by showing knowledge of a secret key K which is shared between and available only to the USIM and in the user's Home Environment. The method is composed of a challenge/response and key establishment protocol combined with a sequence number-based one-pass protocol for network authentication.\n\n5.5\tData integrity of signalling elements\n\nSome signalling information elements are considered sensitive and must be integrity protected. An integrity function shall be applied on certain signalling information elements transmitted between the ME and the network.\n\nThe 3GPP Integrity Algorithm (UIA) is used with an Integrity Key (IK) to compute a message authentication code for a given message. The setting of IK is triggered by the authentication procedure. IK shall be stored on the USIM.\n\n5.6\tUser identity confidentiality\n\nA mechanism shall be specified to provide user identity confidentiality by means of a temporary identity.\n\n5.7\tLength of security parameters\n\nIn order to allow for enhancements of the security level in 3G, the following requirements shall be covered:\n\nIf the USIM supports the GSM security mechanisms in addition to 3G security, fixed length security parameters according to 3GPP TS 51.011 [8] shall be supported in addition.",

This is mainly designed to use LTE for M2M (Machine to Machine) or IoT (Internet of Things). Usually these application requires not that much throughput (in most case it needs very low throughput).\n\nWhy do you need this kind of special technique ? Does this mean that current LTE cannot achieve such a low throughput ?\n\nOf course there is no problem with the current LTE to work for such a low throughput application. But the issue is not with the low throughput, but with some other constraints. In practical point of view, this kind of application would need following characterstics.\n\nAs I said there is no problem with achieving Low Throughput with the current LTE implementation, but there would be limitation to achieve Low Cost, Low Energy Consumption as required in this area (Actually Low Throughput itself is not a goal of the design. It is more like a result of design/implementation that meets MTC criteria illustrated below.\n\nThen how to achieve these critical requirement. The easies way we can think of is to reduce the complexity of LTE and this is the main motivation of MTC and it is one of major topics in Rel 13. I think this would be more important feature/topic in 5G than in 4G (Current LTE).\n\nYou may say 'item i) and ii) has been supported from the day 1 of LTE. So we don't have to do anything (effort /changes) on network side ?'\n\nOnly in terms of throughput in a good signal condition, you may say like it. But with BW 1.4 and single antenna, it is very difficult to apply techniques to improve the reliable data connection (e.g, Spatial Diversity, Frequency Diversity etc). So we may need to change some specification to compensate this restriction.\n\nAlso, we may need to change some lower layer specification due to item iii) as well.\n\nAs of now (Apr 2015), no TS document yet, but you can get pretty details information from following documents.\n\nNow (as of Rel 13) we can see the real implementation of these criteria because LTE MTC specification is released. See how these general criteria turns into reality in LTE : LTE BL/CE (M1) and LTE NB pages.\n\n[2] TR 36.888 - Study on provision of low-cost Machine-Type Communications (MTC) User Equipments (UEs) based on LTE",

    "context": "https://www.sharetechnote.com/html/Communication_Convolution.html\n\nComm. Tech.: Convolution\n\nAs you know, a most typical approach to almost any of the engineering field is to draw out a mathematical model for each component of a system and combine all of the mathematical components to describe the whole system.\n\nLet's assume that we built a mathematical model for each compoenent of a communication system as shown below. As you see, we have a mathematical model named as X which is the model for the signal from a transmitter. and we have another mathematical model named as Y which is for Recieved signal. and we have the model H which is for the channel.\n\nAs I described above, we have the mathematical model for each component of the system. Now the question is how do we combine these componend model to make it for the whole system ?\n\nPartly by intuition and partly by our common sense, we would guess that 'combining X and Y in some format' should produce Y. Then the next question is 'How to combine X and Y' ?\n\nThe first guess would be to try with basic operators like +,-,x,/. Let's think about basic property of these operation. My personal image of these operators are as shown below. Can you make any sense out of this ? Probably no. What I am trying to say with this illustration is \"one lement of Y is created by only one element of X and only one element of H\". Basically they are one\nto one operation. It means that a specific elements in Y is only influenced by only one specific elements in H and Y.\n\nAccording to research and experiments, the received signal is not calculated by this kind of one-to-one operation as described above. In reality, one element in X is influenced by many other elements in X and Y. If I express this in an illustration, it would be as shown below.\n\nYou might not haven't seen this kind of operation in high school math, but this kind of operation is very common to various engineering field and this would give you a lot of hard time at entering the university level engineering because you have never been familiar with this kind of operation in high school math.\n\nThe most commonly used operator which is operating like this is 'Convolution'. The convolution can be described as shown below. The symbol '*' represents 'Convolution'. (Don't get confused with multiplication symbol that you use in your computer software).\n\nFor further detailed description of Convolution, refer to Convolution section of Engineering Math.\n\nConvolution is a mathematical operator which gives the result when a sequence of a data goes through a specific process. Basically each elements of an output sequence is influenced by many previous element of input sequence and all the elements within the process the signal is going through. At the beginning, this would be very confusing cocept and just any of single explanation and\nlecture would never give you complete understanding for it. I am pretty sure that my explanation here would not give you the complete understanding if this is the first time for you to hear about 'Convolution', but if you have gone through many other resources before, i am pretty sure that my explanation would give you some additional insight and clarification. I stronly recomment you to try googling 'Convolution' and it would give you a lot of explanation with a little bit different aspects. You would find\nsome Java applets or animation showing the concept of Counvolution. Even in YouTube, you would get a lot of lectures about Convolution. Try all those materials as much as possible.\n\nEven though you have understandings of Convolution in mathematical sense, you would not have your own intuitive understandings of the concept without a lot of practice. Unlike the simple mathemtical operators like +,-,x,/ it would be very difficult to do practice about Convolution just by pen and paper since the calulation process is so complicated.\n\nTo help you with the practice, I would give you a short Matlab/Octave script. Try changing the vector x and chann and see how the outcome changes. Try to make your own association (relation) between input(x), chann and output(y).\n\nI strongly, strongly recommend you to try this on your own with pen and paper until you grasp the meaning of the process. (I posted the excel spreadsheet for this process. You can get it from here and try wth different values for f(n), g(n))\n\nWhen you complete this whole process, collect the values shown in red cell on right side and place it in a raw from left to right. That is the final result of convolution.\n\nIf you think you got the complete understanding of the process shown above. Try followings by your hand and see if your answer is correct.\n\nx = [0 1 0 1 0 1]; % Change this array if you want to change input sequence (transmitted data)\n\nchan = [0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0]; % Change this array if you want to change the characteristics of channel\n\nsubplot(2,5,3);stem(chan,'MarkerFaceColor',[0 0 1]);axis([1 length(chan) -1.5 1.5]);title(\"chan\");\n\nsubplot(2,5,8);stem(chan,'MarkerFaceColor',[0 0 1]);axis([1 length(chan) -1.5 1.5]);title(\"chan\");\n\nNow let's look at the first example. The input (tx signal) is a typtical rectangular pulse that you see in various electrical engineering books. The channel has 10 elements in it and only the first item is nonzero value 1 and all the other elements are set as '0'. Here the channel is a process which is manipulating the input sequence.\n\nLook at the output. The output(rx signal) is the result of convolution of input(tx signal) and chan. You see there is no difference at all between the input and output. It means the channel in this example is just passing through the input sequence without any modification.\n\nNow let's look at another example. The input (tx signal) is a typtical rectangular pulse that you see in various electrical engineering books. The channel has 10 elements in it and only the first item is nonzero value 0.5 and all the other elements are set as '0'. Here the channel is a process which is manipulating the input sequence.\n\nLook at the output. The output(rx signal) is the result of convolution of input(tx signal) and chan. You see there is no difference in terms of overall shape but the amplitude of output is half (0.5 times) of the input signal.\n\nLet's look at another example. The input (tx signal) is a typtical rectangular pulse that you see in various electrical engineering books. The channel has 10 elements in it and only the fifth is nonzero value 1 and all the other elements are set as '0'. This channel is almost same as the first example. The only difference is that the position for the non-zero value appears.\n\nLook at the output. The output(rx signal) is the result of convolution of input(tx signal) and chan. You see there is almost no difference between the input and output and the only difference is that there is some delay between the input and output. It means the channel in this example is just delaying the input sequence without changing anything in terms of amplitude.\n\nLet's look at another example. The input (tx signal) is a typtical rectangular pulse that you see in various electrical engineering books. The channel has 10 elements in it and only the fifth is nonzero value 0.5 and all the other elements are set as '0'. This channel is almost same as the first example. The only difference is that the position for the non-zero value appears.\n\nLook at the output. The output(rx signal) is the result of convolution of input(tx signal) and chan. Now you see two differences between the input and output. You would notice that both delay and amplitude has been changed. It means the channel in this example is just delaying the input sequence and changing the amplitude as well.\n\nsubplot(2,5,3);stem(chan,'MarkerFaceColor',[0 0 1]);axis([1 length(chan) -1.5 1.5]);title(\"chan\");\n\nsubplot(2,5,8);stem(chan,'MarkerFaceColor',[0 0 1]);axis([1 length(chan) -1.5 1.5]);title(\"chan\");\n\nsubplot(2,5,3);stem(chan,'MarkerFaceColor',[0 0 1]);axis([1 length(chan) -1.5 1.5]);title(\"chan\");\n\nsubplot(2,5,8);stem(chan,'MarkerFaceColor',[0 0 1]);axis([1 length(chan) -1.5 1.5]);title(\"chan\");\n\nsubplot(2,5,3);stem(chan,'MarkerFaceColor',[0 0 1]);axis([1 length(chan) -1.5 1.5]);title(\"chan\");\n\nsubplot(2,5,8);stem(chan,'MarkerFaceColor',[0 0 1]);axis([1 length(chan) -1.5 1.5]);title(\"chan\");\n\nNote : I posted a visual note in slideshow and animation format to show the concept of this example to give you more intuitive understanding. Check [Engineering]->[1]->[Convolution] in www.slide4math.com\n\nThere would be no real system (no real channel) which is simple as simple as described above, but the example shown above would be a good example to help you understand very basic properties of Convolution.\n\nx = [0 1 0 1 0 1]; % Change this array if you want to change input sequence (transmitted data)\n\nchan = [[0 0 0 0 0] chan]; % Change this array if you want to change the characteristics of channel\n\nsubplot(2,5,3);stem(chan,'MarkerFaceColor',[0 0 1]);axis([1 length(chan) -0.5 0.5]);title(\"chan\");\n\nsubplot(2,5,8);stem(chan,'MarkerFaceColor',[0 0 1]);axis([1 length(chan) -0.5 0.5]);title(\"chan\");\n\nNote : I posted a visual note in slideshow and animation format to show the concept of this example to give you more intuitive understanding. Check [Engineering]->[1]->[Convolution] in www.slide4math.com\n\nOne simple example is as follows. As you see, the input is the same as the ones we used in previous examples. You would notice that the values in channel is much more complex than the ones we saw in previous examples. And the result is as shown below. If you already have gone through any basic electronic course, you would notice that the output is very similar to the case where a rectangular\npulse is going through a capacitance circuit.\n\nLet me give you another example. As you see, the input is the same as the ones we used in previous examples.

You see the overal shape of the output (rx signal) is same as the one you saw in previous\nexample, but you would notice that a delay was introduced in this example.\n\nNow I will give you even more complex examples. The Matlab/Octave code for these examples are listed below.\n\nx = [0 1 0 1 0 1]; % Change this array if you want to change input sequence (transmitted data)\n\nchan = [0 0 0 0 0 chan]; % Change this array if you want to change the characteristics of channel\n\nsubplot(2,5,3);stem(chan,'MarkerFaceColor',[0 0 1]);axis([1 length(chan) -1.5 1.5]);title(\"chan\");\n\nsubplot(2,5,8);stem(chan,'MarkerFaceColor',[0 0 1]);axis([1 length(chan) -1.5 1.5]);title(\"chan\");\n\nLet me give you an example. As you see, the input is the same as the ones we used in previous examples. You would notice that the values in channel is similar to previous example and the difference is that we have both positive and negative values alternating each ofther in channel sequence. And the result is as shown below. You see the ringing both at rising and falling phase.\nThis is a very similar case where a signal is going through a L-C circuit or typical transmission lines.\n\nLet me give you another example. As you see, the input is the same as the ones we used in previous examples. You would notice that the values in channel is similar to previous example and the only difference is that you have some zeros at the beginning of channel sequence. And the result is as shown below.

This means that MSCB keeps control of the radio resources connection and release towards BSS-B. MSCB will do some processing on the BSSMAP information received on the E-interface or A-interface whereas it will relay the DTAP information transparently between Ainterface and E-interface. MSCA initiates and drives a subset of BSSMAP procedures towards MSCB, while MSCB controls them towards its BSSs to the extent that MSCB is responsible for the connections of its BSSs. The release of the dedicated resources between MSCB and BSS-B is under the responsibility of MSCB and BSSB, and is not directly controlled by MSCA. When clearing is to be performed due to information received from BSS-B, MSCB shall transfer this clearing indication to MSCA, to clear its connection with BSS-B, to terminate the dialogue with MSCA through the Einterface, and to release its circuit connection with MSCA, if any. In the same way, the release of the connection to its BSS-B, is initiated by MSCB, when the dialogue with MSCA ends normally and a release is received from the circuit connection with MSCA, if any, or when the dialogue with the MSCA ends abnormally.\n\nWhen a release is received by MSCB for the circuit connection with MSCA then MSCB shall release the circuit connection.\nIn the Inter-system Inter-MSC handover case, the role of MSCB (MSCB') is only to provide radio resources control within its area. This means that MSCB keeps control of the radio resources connection and release towards BSS-B. MSCB will do some processing on the BSSMAP information received on the E-interface or A-interface whereas it will relay the DTAP information transparently between Ainterface and E-interface. 3G_MSCA initiates and drives a subset of BSSMAP procedures towards MSCB, while MSCB controls them towards its BSSs to the extent that MSCB is responsible for the connections of its BSSs. The release of the dedicated resources between MSCB and BSS-B is under the responsibility of MSCB and BSSB, and is not directly controlled by 3G_MSCA. When clearing is to be performed due to information received from BSS-B, MSCB shall transfer this clearing indication to 3G_MSCA, to clear its connection with BSS-B, to terminate the dialogue with 3G_MSCA through the Einterface, and to release its circuit connection with 3G_MSCA, if any. In the same way, the release of the connection to its BSS-B, is initiated by MSCB, when the dialogue with 3G_MSCA ends normally and a release is received from the circuit connection with MSCA, if any, or when the dialogue with the MSCA ends abnormally.\n\nWhen a release is received by MSCB for the circuit connection with 3G_MSCA then MSCB shall release the circuit connection.\nFor subsequent inter-MSC handover to an area where \"Intra Domain Connection of RAN Nodes to Multiple CN Nodes\" is applied, MSC-B can have multiple target CN nodes for each handover target in a pool-area as specified in 3GPP TS 23.236.\nMSC-B may support subsequent inter-MSC inter-system handover to a CSG cell. If MSC-B supports handover to a CSG cell, the serving BSS is served by MSC-B and provides a CSG ID for the target cell, and the call is not an emergency call, then MSC-B checks the CSG membership of the UE for the target cell using the CSG subscription data provided by the anchor MSC-A or 3G_MSC-A during the basic inter-MSC handover before proceeding with the subsequent handover procedure. If there is no subscription data for this CSG ID or the CSG subscription for the CSG ID has expired, MSC-B considers the membership check as failed.\n\nFor subsequent handover of an emergency call to a CSG cell, MSC-B shall skip the CSG membership check and proceed with the handover procedure.\nFor subsequent inter-PLMN handover to a CSG cell, if the anchor MSC-A or 3G_MSC-A provided a CSG ID list for the target PLMN during the basic inter-MSC handover, MSC-B shall validate the CSG membership of the UE in the target CSG cell using the CSG ID list for the target PLMN.\nIf the anchor MSC-A or 3G_MSC-A provided only a CSG ID list for the PLMN of MSC-B, then based on operator's configuration the MSC-B may allow the handover by validating the CSG membership of the UE in the target CSG cell using this CSG ID list. Otherwise, MSC-B shall reject the handover due to no CSG subscription information of the target PLMN-ID available.\n4.2.2\tFunctional composition of MSCB and its interfaces for handover\n\nThe functional composition of an MSC acting as MSCB is essentially the same as that of MSCA. However, there are some differences. The functional units are as follows (see figure 3).\nSignalling functions:\nSwitching functions:",

In order to achieve wider bandwidth, carrier aggregation (CA) of up to 16 NR carriers is further supported. Both CA within a frequency band (intra-band CA) and CA across frequency bands (inter-band CA) are supported. For the case of inter-band CA, CA with different numerologies, e.g., CA between NR carrier in FR1 and NR carrier in FR2, is also supported.\n\nNR newly defines the concept of bandwidth part (BWP). A UE can be configured with up to four BWPs per NR carrier for DL and UL, respectively. Each BWP has its own parameters including bandwidth and numerology. The bandwidth of the BWP is configured for each UE according to the UE capability on supported maximum bandwidth, and hence multiple UEs having different bandwidth capabilities can be served in a single wideband NR carrier. Also, multiple BWPs with different numerologies can be multiplexed within a single NR carrier to support different types of services. The bandwidth of the BWP can be narrower than the supported maximum bandwidth for the UE so that UE power saving is achieved. In addition, BWP adaptation based on switching between BWPs having different bandwidths and/or numerologies is supported.\n\nFor EN-DC operation, simultaneous UL transmissions across LTE and NR are supported.

This will enable broader range of verticals to integrate with 3GPP systems. Currently, multiple northbound API-related specifications already exist (e.g. APIs for Service Capability Exposure Function (SCEF) defined in TS 23.682 [1], APIs for the interface between MBMS service provider and BM-SC defined in TR 26.981 [2]).\n\nFor API consumers or invokers (in particular for 3rd party API developers), a consistent and uniform API framework across multiple northbound API specifications is necessary. In 3GPP Release-15, a Common API Framework (CAPIF) was introduced to support the common API aspects (e.g. authentication, authorization, publishing, discovery, access control policy, etc.), which allows the northbound service APIs to be integrated into CAPIF, such that the API invokers can utilize a single framework for accessing and invoking the 3GPP northbound APIs.\n\nTR 23.722 [3] is a (Stage 2) technical report that analyses existing API frameworks, and identifies requirements and potential architecture solutions to support a common approach for API development within 3GPP, including recommendations for the normative work.\n\nTS 23.222 [4] specifies the (Stage 2) functional architecture model, procedures and information flows needed to support the CAPIF, and guidelines for a consistent development of northbound API (service and CAPIF APIs) in 3GPP.\n\nTS 29.222 [5] specifies the detailed (Stage 3) APIs messages and protocols needed to support CAPIF, based on the Stage 2 functional architecture.\n\nThe CAPIF functional model is illustrated in Figure 2-1. The functional model describes the CAPIF core function (CCF) and API provider domain functions i.e. API exposing function (AEF), API publishing function (APF) and API management function (AMF), and as well as the reference points between these functions and the API invoker/consumer.\n\nThe functional model as described in TS 23.222 [4], specified architecture-level procedures and information flows for common API aspects, including onboarding, offboarding, publishing, unpublishing, update of service APIs, discovery, registration, authentication, authorization, logging, auditing, monitoring, and topology hiding.\n\nIt further specified the application of the functional model to CAPIF deployments (both centralized and distributed deployment), and also CAPIF relationship with network exposure functions defined in 3GPP systems (EPS and 5GS).\n\nThe detailed API specification (Stage 3) supporting the CAPIF functional model is provided in TS 29.222 [5], which translates the procedures and interactions over the reference points into following 9 API services (8 CAPIF core function services and 1 API exposing function service):\n\nReferences\n\n11.2.2\tNorthbound APIs for SCEF - SCS/AS Interworking\n\nSummary based on the input provided by Huawei, HiSilicon in SP-171032.\n\nStarting from Rel-13, 3GPP defined the Service Capabilities Exposure Function (SCEF) framework for exposure of those 3GPP network capabilities to the application domain. However, up until Rel-15, 3GPP specified neither the SCEF functional architecture nor its interactions with Service Capability Servers or Application Servers (SCS/AS), i.e. with the application domain. 3GPP was relying on other standardization fora such as OMA or oneM2M.\n\nTriggered by interactions with oneM2M, 3GPP started with Rel-15 to specify the northbound APIs from SCEF to support oneM2M specifications to facilitate a useable end-to-end M2M architecture.\n\nThe services and capabilities offered by SCEF to Service Capability Servers or Application Servers (application domain) include:\n\nThe interface between the SCEF and the SCS/AS is referred to as \"T8\" interface. This feature specifies the architectural description (including message flows, and parameters) of the T8 interface.\n\nThe T8 interface supports offline and online charging. The charging architecture and scenarios specific to Northbound API, as well as the mapping of the common 3GPP charging architecture onto the Northbound API, are specified in TS 32.240 [2].\n\nThe Northbound API charging architecture, charging principles and scenarios, definition of charging information and content of the CDRs for offline charging are specified in TS 32.254 [3].\n\nThe corresponding AVPs and ASN.1 are specified in TS 32.298 [4] and TS 32.299 [5].\n\nReferences",

In the same way, the release of the connection to its RNS-B, is initiated by 3G_MSCB, when the dialogue with MSCA ends normally and a release is received from the circuit connection with MSCA, if any, or when the dialogue with the MSCA ends abnormally.\n\nWhen a release is received by 3G_MSCB for the circuit connection with MSCA then 3G_MSCB shall release the circuit connection.\nAt intra-PLMN handover/relocation, 3G_MSC-B shall send Service Handover related information to the BSC/RNC if and only if this Service Handover information is received from 3G_MSC-A. 3G_MSC-B shall not modify Service Handover related information received from a 3G_MSC-A within the same PLMN.\nFor network sharing (see 3GPP TS 25.401, subclause 7.2.3) when SNA information is received by 3G_MSC-B from 3G_MSC-A, 3G MSC-B shall send the SNA information to the RNS.\nIf 3G_MSC-B does not support the optional supplementary service Multicall (see 3GPP TS 23.135) and 3G_MSC-A requests to relocate multiple bearers, 3G_MSC-B shall indicate that it does not support multiple bearers to 3G_MSC-A.\n\nIf 3G_MSC-B supports the optional supplementary service Multicall (see 3GPP TS 23.135) and UE is engaged with multiple bearers the following description applies:\nIf 3G_MSC-B supports the \"Provision of UE Specific Behaviour Information to Network Entities\" (see 3GPP TS 23.195), and if it received UESBI-Iu from MSC-A or 3G_MSC-A during the basic inter-MSC handover/relocation, then 3G_MSC-B shall store the UESBI-Iu and forward it to RNS-B during basic inter-MSC handover/relocation and subsequent intra-3G_MSC-B handover/relocation.\nIf 3G_MSC-B supports SCUDIF calls (see 3GPP TS 23.172), and if it received information of alternative radio access bearer from 3G_MSC-A during the basic inter-MSC handover/relocation or assignment, then 3G_MSC-B shall store that information and forward it to RNS-B during basic inter-MSC handover/relocation or assignment and subsequent intra-3G_MSC-B handover/relocation.\n\n3G_MSC-B may support subsequent inter-system handover or SRNS relocation to a CSG cell. If 3G_MSC-B supports handover/relocation to a CSG cell, the serving BSS or RNS is served by 3G_MSC-B and provides a CSG ID for the target cell, and the call is not an emergency call, then 3G_MSC-B checks the CSG membership of the UE for the target cell using the CSG subscription data provided by the anchor MSC-A or 3G_MSC-A during the basic inter-MSC handover/relocation before proceeding with the subsequent handover/relocation procedure. If there is no subscription data for this CSG ID or the CSG subscription for the CSG ID has expired, 3G_MSC-B considers the membership check as failed.\nFor subsequent handover/relocation of an emergency call to a CSG cell, 3G_MSC-B shall skip the CSG membership check and proceed with the handover/relocation procedure.\n\nFor subsequent inter-PLMN handover/relocation to a CSG cell, if the anchor MSC-A or 3G_MSC-A provided a CSG ID list for the target PLMN during the basic inter-MSC handover/relocation, 3G_MSC-B shall validate the CSG membership of the UE in the target CSG cell using the CSG ID list for the target PLMN.\nBased on operator's configuration, if the anchor MSC-A or 3G_MSC-A provided only a CSG ID list for the PLMN of 3G_MSC-B, the 3G_MSC-B may allow the handover/relocation by validating the CSG membership of the UE in the target CSG cell using this CSG ID list. Otherwise, 3G_MSC-B shall reject the handover/relocation due to no CSG subscription information of the target PLMN-ID available.",

This service component controls the transfer of the trace records from the NEFs to the OSF. The conceptual model is illustrated in figure 5, which employs both the event report function (CCITT X.734 [14]) and the log control function (CCITT X.735 [15]).\n\nThe trace control function collects traceable events within the NEF and formats them into trace records. These trace records may be stored locally within the NEF filestore or transferred to the OSF in the form of event reports. This is controlled by means of the \"priority\" indicator, which is a part of the trace type. If the \"priority\" indicator is not set then the trace records shall stored within the local filestore and subsequently transferred to the OSF in bulk via FTAM.\n\nIf a trace is activated with the \"priority\" indicator set then the trace records shall be sent to the OSF either direct by the trace control function or through Event Forwarding Discriminators (EFDs).\n\nIf EFDs are used then all trace records are offered to the EFDs. The EFDs determine which of the records are to be transmitted to the OSF in the form of event reports and the Operation System Id field in the header is ignored. The EDFs have complex filter constructs, which allow the operator to define the criteria for destinations and filters.\n\nIf EFDs are not used then all priority records are forwarded to the OSF whose address is given in the Operation System Id field. The NEF is required to supply additional information to provide the OS management application entity title.\n\nFinally, the trace records may also be stored in the form of log entries within the log of the NEF. It is up to the operator to decide if the log function is needed in parallel with the event reporting and file store. Once stored, the log records may be individually accessed by the OSF via the appropriate object management functions. Care should be taken of filter criteria for log records to avoid unnecessary overheads.\n\nThis service component contains the following groups of TMN management functions:\n\n9.2\tTransfer of Records\n\n9.2.1\tBulk record transfer\n\nThis group of TMN functions is concerned with the bulk transfer of trace records from the NEF record filestore to the OSF.\n\nThe trace records shall be transferred from the NEF to the OSF by the use of FTAM services. For further details of the use of FTAM see GSM 12.01 [8].\n\nIn addition to the simple file transfer services provided by FTAM, peertopeer application process communication may also be supported. The use of CMIS services for the uploading of files from the NEF to the OSF is specified in the GSM 12.00 [7].\n\nWhen the procedure defined in GSM 12.00 [7] and GSM 12.01 [8] are used to transfer the trace records, the file type shall be traceRecords and the format of the file is given by the type TraceFileFormat.\n\n9.2.2\tLog control\n\nThis function permits the trace record to be stored and retrieved from logs within the NEF. The logging of these records is performed in accordance with the log control function specified in CCITT X.735 [15] and no additional management functions are required.\n\n9.2.3\tLog access\n\nThis TMN function controls the access to the log described above. Each log defined may contain one or more log entries. Each log entry contains a single trace record.\n\nFor further details concerning the use of logs, see CCITT X.735 [15].\n\nThe following system management functions are required:\n\n9.2.4\tEvent Reporting\n\n9.2.4.1\tEvent Forwarding Discriminators\n\nFor shortterm recording of tracing events and for more complicated filter conditions the event forwarding discriminator construct defined in CCITT X.734 [14] and CCITT X.721 [13] can be employed. The event forwarding discriminator construct is extremely flexible permitting the combination of a number of fields and logical operations with a wide variety of scheduling options. The EFD also controls the destinations to which the event reports are sent. Several such filters may be defined and scheduled for operation at different times and for different time periods.\n\nThe following system management functions are required:\n\n9.2.4.2\tDirect Transfer by Trace Control Function\n\nThis function permits the NEF to transmit trace records direct to the OSF. In general the trace record shall be sent on completion of the call or the traceable event. This function is controlled by means of the \"priority\" indicator, which is contained in the trace type. If the priority indicator is not set, then the trace records shall be stored on file within the NE filestore. These records may be subsequently collected via bulk record transfer as described in subclause 9.2.1. If the trace type specified on activation includes the \"priority\" indicator then all of the records shall be sent via trace reports to the OSF specified by the operation system id.\n\nThe following system management functions are required:",

    "context": "https://www.sharetechnote.com/html/Handbook_LTE_LTEU_LTER.html\n\nLTE Adv: LAA/LTE-U\n\nRecently (from 2014 as far as I remember), there has been pretty much discussion (even real testing going on) on LTE being extended to non-standard mode of operation (Non 3GPP yet at least up to this point, as of Jan 2015).\n\nNote : In early second half of 2016, I saw a company to try LTE-U device for the first timie, and as it approaches to the end of the year, I saw many companies testing LTE-U devices. Now in early 2017 we are at the stage of testing LAA.\n\nTwo of the technology falling into this category is LTE-U and LTE-R. LTE-U has been proposed and start being implemented in the industry for about a year and LTE-R just start being proposed as Integrated wireless railway network to be commercialized .\n\nAs of Jun 2016, I don't see/hear anything about LTE-R.. but I saw the drastic evolution of unlicensed LTE that created several different technologies (names) to the list. It started with LTE-U and evolved to LAA, eLAA and recently we are hearing of new branches like MulteFire and LWA. I don't know how many other technologies are waiting to be newly evolved and which of these technologies\nwill survive to the end.. some of them are now pretty well defined but there are a lot of other features to be defined technically. I will keep following them up and try to write down whatever has been clarified.\n\nFollowings are the brief descriptions for each of these technologies. I will put further details under separate section if more technical details are published. Also, I put many whitepapers and YouTube links under Reference section. I would recommend you to go through those materials when you have free time and use this page as reminder afterwards. (The contents of this table\nis mostly based on Ref [7] )\n\nFollowings are the list of topics that gives you further details of various LTE-Unlicensed technologies.\n\nIn every wireless communication, the communicating parties (transmitter and reciever) need to allocatie a certain amount of resources in both time domain and frequency domain. However, we don't have much control over frequency domain resource allocation because those resources are fixed permanently or semi-statically. So it is usually not in the scope of scheduling. When it comes to scheduling, Time Domain resource allocation tend to be more important.\n\nIn 3GPP based technology (i.e, Cellular Communication Technology like LTE), the time domain scheduling is obvious and determinstic even when there are many devices are in communication because all of the time domain resources determined by the central master (Base Station /Node B/eNode B). However, in 802.11 based technology(i.e LAN, Wireless LAN etc) there is no central controling master in terms of scheduling. In this case, there is always possibility that transmission signal from one device interfere with communication of other devices. To prevent (or at least reduce) this situation, we need a special algorithm for Time Domain Scheduling. Time Domain Scheduling in this case mean 'Determine when to transmit and how long it transmit'.\n\nThen why we need to care of this kind of thing in LTE-Unlicensed technology ? Basically LTE Unlicensed technology (e.g, LTE-U, LAA etc) refer to a technology in which LTE operates in 802.11 frequency region. So LTE need to keep the rule set by 802.11 in order not to prevent the communiction between existing 802.11 devices.\n\nThere are many variations of the time domain scheduling, but the basic idea and logic is same. Basic idea is 'Your transmission should not interfere with communication between others' and the basic logic is 'Before you transmit anything, check if the chennel(medium) is already being used by others'. This logic can be illustrated as follows.\n\nThen you may have some questions as follows : How to check (i.e, how to figure out) whether the channel (medium) is being used by other ? and how long the device need to check before it make any decision ?\n\nIn the effort to answer these questions, you will come across many terms that may confuse you for so long. I tried to list up those confusing words and how these are related to each other in following illustration. If you are new to this area, I would suggest you to understand 'what is CS and ED ?' first and then try to understand how CS / ED is used in higher level technology like CSMA/CD, CSMA/CA, CCS, LBT, CSAT etc. Already feel headache ? :)\n\nCS / ED : CS stands for Carrier Sensing and ED stands for Energy Detection. The fundamental concept is same. The term CS is more frequently used in 802.11 area especially for Wired LAN Area. In this technology, the device measures the energy level in the channel (medium) mostly in the form of voltage and compares the measured voltage with a specified value (threshold value). ED stands for Energy Detection. it is more frequently used in wireless/cellular technology. In this method, the device measures the energy level in the channel (medium) mostly in the form of Power and compares the measured power with a specified value (threshold value)\n\nCSMA/CD or CSMA/CA : As the term CSMA(Carrier Sensing Multiple Access) implies, these are technology of figuring out whether a channel is available or not based on CS method. You don't need to know the details of thechnology under the context of LTE-Unlicensed technology, but if you are really interested in thses method refer to CSMA/CD and CSMA/CA page.\n\nCCA : CCA stands for Clear Channel Assessment. As the word implies, this is a method to figure out the channel is clear (i.e, nobody is using the channel). CCA perform ED(Energy Detection) for a certain period of time and make a decision whether the channel is clear or not. It is a common method being used in 802.11 (WLAN) technology.\n\nHow long CCA perform ED before it make decision ? It depends on higher layer technology (e.g, 802.11 FHSS, 802.11 OFDM, LBT). However, the minimum time span is 18 us sec.\n\nWhat is the threshold energy level to make decision whether the channel is being used by some other device or not ? This also varies depending on power class of the device and reciever antenna gain. However, the base threshold is -70 dBm.\n\nNOTE : Refer to 802.11 specification and ETSI EN 300 328 if you want to get full details and requirement for CCA.\n\nLBT: LBT stands for Listen Before Talk. According to ETSI EN 300 328, LBT is defined as 'mechanism by which an equipment applies clear channel assessment (CCA) before using the channel' (In this document, you can find a couple of variations of LBT depending on different situations). As you see in the terminology itself, 'Listen Before Talk' indicate two major process, the first one is 'Listen' and the second part is 'Talk'. The meaning of 'Talk' is obvious. It means 'Transmit Data'. The tricky part is 'what does it exactly mean by 'Listen''. In more technical definition, 'Listen' mean 'perform CCA(Clear Channel Assessment)'. You can find a more detailed description on LBT in IEEE P802.19-08/0034r0 (The specific value (i.e, transmission time, threshold value may vary depending on application, but I think this explains overal LBT mechanism in easier way than other documents).\n\nCSAT : CSAT stands for Carrier Sensing Adaptive Transmission. CSAT is very similar to CSMA or LBT(Listen Before Talk), the main difference is that CSAT monitors(senses) the medium for much longer duration (around tens of msec to 200 msec) comparing to normal WiFi CSMA, so that it would not interfere not only with WiFi\ndata transmission (QoS traffic) but also with more sporadic transmission like discovery signals (Ref [2]). Unlike other techiques described in this section (defined with focus on 802.11 technology), CSAT is defined by LTE-U Forum with focus on 3GPP technology.\n\nIn LTE, every transmission within a specified spectrum is well managed/scheduled both for downlink and uplink. So Network can figure out exactly when to transmit something and when UE will transmit something.. but in Unlicensed band transmission and reception by the existing WiFi device is not as predictable as in LTE. Basically anybody can transmit in anytime as long as it complies with\nCSMA/CA procedure.\n\nIn this kind of situation, how LTE network can schedule transmission in Unlicensed band ?\n\nOne method is for LTE cell to perform a special channel selection procedure and allocate the channel only when it is clean. \nIn channel selection process, network measures the energy level within the allowed band and use those area in which the energy level is under a certain threshold (e.g, -62 dBm over 20 Mhz BW).\n\nThe Cell performs this kind of channel selection algorithm in on-going mode and if needed it will select more suitable channel and switch to it.\n\nWhat if you (a Cell) fail to find any clean channel at the initial channel selection process ?\n\nIn this case, the cell use another mechanism called CSAT (Carrier-Sensing Adaptive Transmission). Technically, CSAT is very similar to CSMA or LBT(Listen Before Talk), the main difference is that CSAT monitors(senses) the medium for much longer duration (around tens of msec to 200 msec) comparing to normal WiFi CSMA, so that it would not interfere not only with WiFi\ndata transmission (QoS traffic) but also with more sporadic transmission like discovery signals (Ref [2]).\n\nAccording to Reference [5], there seems to be roughly three levels of Coexistence strategy regarding LTE-U. Most of these techniques are already mentioned in previous section, but let me rewrite in a little bit different words.\n\nChannel Selection : This says \"Use WiFi band only when it is not being used (i.e, the band is clean)\". To figure out whether it is being used or not, you have to measure the engergy level of the target band as described above.\n\nTime-domain coexistence techniques : Even when it fail to find any clean channel in channel selection stage, there is still some chance. Even though there is no clean channel at the point of channel selection, there might be some empty slots if you look at the time domain scheduling with relatively high granularity.\nTo find out this kind of time domain opportunity and in order not to make an interference at any time, they are considering several different technology like CSAT, eCSAT, LBT. My personal question were 'do we have to support all these technology everywhere (every devices)?'. This question was answered by Reference [5] as follows.\n\nFor non listen-before-talk (LBT) markets such as the US, South Korea, China and India, CSAT (Carrier Sensing Adaptive Transmission) can be used without changing Rel-10 Carrier Aggregation protocols for co-channel coexistence. For LBT markets such as Europe and Japan, Rel-13 LAA will enable channel sharing with Wi-Fi by performing clear channel assessment (CCA) based channel availability sensing and adapting the transmission duration on a fine timescale, ranging from 1ms-10ms\n\nOpportunistic SCell operation : To me, this sounds like a rule (not a technology). Basically this says \"Use the unlicensed band only when it is really necessary (e.g, in real demand on high throughput or when the primary cell is overloaded). Release the unlicensenced and fall back to anchor carrier when\nthe demand for unlicenced band is not critical.\n\nInterplay of these coexistance technical components are well illustrated as follows in Ref [2].\n\nLTE-U stands for LTE-Unlicensed. This is the first real implementation of the whole LTE-Unlicensed family as far as I remember. Since this is already implemented and tested relatively widely and a lot of details are known, I thought I got enough information to write this subject in a separate page. Refer to LTE-U page for the details.\n\nIn other LTE-Unlincensed technology, LTE borrow only radio spectrum from WLAN and all the transmission/reception technology except radio spectrum purely based on LTE. However, in LWA LTE borrows not only WLAN radio spectrum but also WLAN Access Point for transmitting data. This key difference is illustrated as below. To implement this key difference, we would need to implement many other\ntechnical components. The most important part would be to implmenet special interface between LTE eNB and WLAN AP. Then you may ask.. at which layer the eNB and WLAN will be connected ? It would be quicker to interact if they can get connected at lower layer (e.g, PHY/MAC), but LTE PHY/MAC and WLAN PHY/MAC is completely different.. so hard to make any connection at this layer. So they will use higher layer (specifically PDCP) for this connection. As you know, there is no PDCP layer in WLAN. So connecting at PDCP\nlayer might be a little bit misleading. More accruately speaking, LTE PDCP packet will be encapsulated into WLAN MAC frame.\n\nNow LWA is defined in 3GPP specification and I created a separate page for 3GPP LWA because it will be a long story. Refer to LWA page for the 3GPP details.\n\nAround the end of 2016, I start hearing of implementing this both on UE modem and Network, UE testing equipment side. Now (as of early 2017) I am hearing of testing this feature on real UE. So I decided to create separate page for this. Read LAA page for the details.\n\nPutting very simple way, Multipath Aggregation (more formally Multipath TCP Aggregation : mptcp) is LTE-WLAN aggregation at TCP level as illustrated below. The key component in this architecture would be MP Proxy (Multipath Proxy) and this part is being defined in IETF (Ref [12] )\n\nAs of now (Jan 2015), I don't have any specific information other than Integrated wireless railway network to be commercialized .\n\n[1] LTE-U/LAA, MuLTEfire and Wi-Fi; making best use of unlicensed spectrum (Qualcomm)\n\n[9] Cracking Google Project Fi & LTE/Wi-Fi Aggregation with Qualcomm - Wi-Fi Now Episode 5 (YouTube)\n\n[10] The LTE-U vs. Wi-Fi debate continues empowering carriers with seamless Wi-Fi - Wi-Fi Now Episode 15 (YouYube)\n\n[15] ETSI EN 300 328 Wideband transmission systems;Data transmission equipment operating in the 2,4 GHz ISM band and using wide band modulation techniques;",

Primarily, the \"Virtual Reality Profiles for Streaming Media\" specification in TS.26.118 [2] was developed to support Virtual Reality (VR) in streaming applications. In addition, the media capabilities are enabled in Packet Switched Streaming (PSS) Services and Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service (MBMS) by updates of the specifications TS 26.234 [3] and TS 26.346 [4], respectively. The characterization results for audio media profile proponents are documented in TR 26.818 [5].\n\nBased on the findings in TR 26.918 [6], the work item developed the first set of Virtual Reality Profiles for Streaming Media. Virtual Reality (VR) is the ability to be virtually present in a space created by the rendering of natural and/or synthetic image and sound correlated by the movements of the immersed user allowing interacting with that world. Virtual reality typically assumes a user to wear a head mounted display (HMD), to completely replace the user's field of view with a simulated visual component, and to wear headphones, to provide the user with the accompanying audio. In the first set of technologies defined in TS 26.118, VR users are expected to be able to look around from a single observation point in 3D space, also referred to as three degrees of freedom (3DoF). It allows the user to (i) tilt side to side (Rolling), (ii) tilt forward and backward (Pitching), and (iii) turning left and right (Yawing). The specification defines a 3GPP 3DOF reference and coordinate system as well as an end-to-end architecture. In the reference client, it is assumed that pose information, i.e. the position derived by the head tracking sensor expressed by (azimuth; elevation; tilt angle), is continuously available to the VR renderer in order to render the viewport. Based on the system model, video and audio technologies are defined including system technologies (DASH and file format), suitable codecs and rendering technologies.\n\nSpecifically on video, three operation points (combination of elementary stream and rendering metadata) and three corresponding media profiles are defined, namely:\n\nFor PSS, all three profiles are added, the first one is mandatory ( 'shall'), the second one recommended ('should') and the third one allowed ('may'). For MBMS, the first two profiles are added, the first one is mandatory ( 'shall'), the second one is recommended ( 'should') and constrained to non-viewport adaptive streaming.\n\nFor audio, one solution was selected and is documented in TS 26.118, namely MPEG-H 3D Audio Baseline profile. This technology enables the distribution of channel, object and scene-based 3D audio. Additional interesting technologies enabling the distribution of channel, object and scene-based 3D audio were considered, and the characterization results of all proposed technologies are documented in TR 26.818 [5].\n\nIn addition to media specific metadata, system metadata is added to TS 26.118 to support rendering of 360 experiences on 2D screens, including the aspects of rendering without pose information. Basic requirements for a full audio-visual experience are documented under the umbrella of VR Presentations.\n\nThe completion of the work item provides a set of consistent technologies for Virtual Reality in Rel-15 for 5G Phase 1. It is providing a response to the demand identified during the successful joint 3GPP/VR-IF Workshop on Virtual Reality that took place in December 2017 [7], which was an integral part of the development of 3GPP Virtual Reality Profiles for Streaming Applications.\n\nReferences",

The SON architecture can be a centralized, distributed or a hybrid solution.\n\nThis is the dynamic plug-and-play configuration of newly deployed eNBs. The eNB will by itself configure the Physical Cell Identity, transmission frequency and power, leading to faster cell planning and rollout.\n\nThe interfaces S1 and X2 are dynamically configured, as well as the IP address and connection to IP backhaul. To reduce manual work ANR (Automatic neighbour relations) is used. ANR configures the neighbouring list in newly deployed eNBs and is optimizing the list configuration during operation.\n\nDynamic configuration includes the configuration of the Layer 1 identifier, Physical cell identity (PCI) and Cell global ID (CGID). There are 504 different PCIs available in LTE, the PCI mapping shall fulfill the collision free condition as well as the confusion free. The PCI can be assigned either in a centralized or distributed way.\n\nWhen centralised assignment is used the OAM system will have a complete knowledge and control of the PCIs. When the distributed solution is used the OAM system assigns a list of possible PCIs to the newly deployed eNB, but the adoption of the PCI is in control of the eNB. The newly deployed eNB will request a report, sent either by User Equipment (UEs) over the air interface or by other eNBs over the X2 interface, including already in-use PCIs, see figure 1. - The eNB will randomly select its PCI from the remaining values.\n\nANR is used to minimize the work required for configuration in newly deployed eNBs as well as to optimize configuration during operation. Correct and up-to-date neighbouring lists will increase the number of successful handovers and minimize the number of dropped calls. Before a handover can be executed the source eNB requires the neighbouring information: PCI and CGID of the target eNB.\n\nThe PCI is included in every normal measurement report. The mapping between the PCI and CGID parameters can be done by using information from the OAM or reported by UEs decoding the target cell CGID on the broadcast channel in the target cell, see figure 2. The capability of decoding CGID is an optional UE feature.\n\nA network operator can put a cell on a ANR black list, to block certain handover candidates, for example from indoor to outdoor cells. 3GPP has also specified LTE Inter-Frequency and Inter-RAT (Radio Access Technology) ANR.\n\nFunctions for self-optimisation are mainly included in Release 9. It includes optimisation of coverage, capacity, handover and interference.\n\nMobility load balancing (MLB) is a function where cells suffering congestion can transfer load to other cells, which have spare resources. MLB includes load reporting between eNBs to exchange information about load level and available capacity.\n\nThe periodicity of the reporting can be requested in the range of 1 to 10 s. The report can contain, hardware load, S1 transport network load and Radio resource status. The Radio resource status reports are separated in Up Link and Down Link reports, including the total allocation guaranteed and non-guaranteed bit rate traffic, the percentage of allocated Physical Resource Block (PRB) and the percentage of PRBs available for load balancing.\n\nMLB can also be used between different Radio Technologies. In case of inter-RAT the load reporting RAN Information Management (RIM) protocol will be used to transfer the information via the core between the base stations of different radio technologies. A cell capacity class value, set by the OAM-system, will be used to compare and weigh the different technologies radio capacities against each other.\n\nA handover due to load balancing is carried out as a regular handover, but it may be necessary to amend parameters so that the User Equipment (UE) does not return to the congested cell. The amendment must take place in both cells, so that the handover settings remain coherent in both. The eNBs need to estimate how much the cell border needs to be shifted, expressed in dB, to avoid a quick return of the UE.\n\nMobility robustness optimization (MRO) is a solution for automatic detection and correction of errors in the mobility configuration. In Release 9 the focus is on errors causing Radio link failure (RLF) due to too late or early handover, or handover to an incorrect cell.\n\nIn case of late handover, see figure 3, the handover procedure in the source cell is initialized too late, since the UE is moving faster than the Handover (HO) parameter settings allow. Hence when the RRC HO command from the serving cell is transmitted the signal strength is too weak to reach the UE, now located in the target cell, connection is lost. The UE attempts a connection re-establishment, containing PCID and C-RNTI belonging to the source cell, but received by the target cell. The target eNB will then inform the source cell about RLF to adjust Handover parameters.\n\nIt is a bit more complicated to detect a too early handover, see figure 4. The UE has successfully been handed over from source cell A to target cell B, but since it was triggered too early the connection will drop almost immediately due to too poor radio conditions in the target cell B. The UE will then try to re-establish the connection, which will now take place in the original source cell, cell A, since this cell is the strongest one. The UE will use the PCID and RNTI from the target cell B and the source cell A will then consider this as a Radio Link Failure due to too late handover and send an indication to the target cell B. But the target cell B will now recognize the parameters in the indication, as given to a mobile that had just completed a handover to cell B from cell A now indicating failure. The target cell B will send back a report about too early Handover to adjust Handover parameters, to the source cell A.\n\nIn order to save energy some cells can be switched off when capacity is not needed. The power consumption in a base station is not only related to load, a number of functions requires power even if there are no users to serve. But, if a cell is switched off, in the legal operator license there are still requirements on coverage, the coverage must be maintained at all times! The suspension of the cell may occur when the last user leaves the cell, all incoming handovers during this period of time will then be rejected. The cells that remain on, providing coverage, can wake up a suspended cell when traffic load increase. This can be done with a wake-up call to the sleeping cell.\n\nRACH optimisation aims to minimise the number of attempts on the RACH channel, causing interference. The UE can be polled by the eNB for RACH statistics after connection. The number of preambles sent until successful RACH completion, and the number of contention resolution failure are in the statistics. But PRACH configuration parameters can also be distributed amongst eNBs, like zero correlation configuration, root sequence, high speed flag and PRACH frequency offset.\n\nFeatures for automatic detection and removal of failures and automatic adjustment of parameters are mainly specified in Release 10.\n\nCoverage and Capacity Optimization enables automatic correction of capacity problems depending on slowly changing environment, like seasonal variations.\n\nMinimization of drive tests (MDT), is enabling normal UEs to provide the same type of information as those collected in drive test. A great advantage is that UEs can retrieve and report parameters from indoor environments.",

Operators have met this challenge by increasing capacity with new radio spectrum, adding multi-antenna techniques and implementing more efficient modulation and coding schemes.\n\nHowever, these measures alone are insufficient in the most crowded environments and at cell edges where performance can significantly degrade. Operators are also adding small cells and tightly-integrating these with their macro networks to spread traffic loads, widely maintain performance and service quality while reusing spectrum most efficiently.\n\nOne way to expand an existing macro-network, while maintaining it as a homogeneous network, is to \"densify\" it by adding more sectors per eNB or deploying more macro-eNBs. However, reducing the site-to-site distance in the macro-network can only be pursued to a certain extent because finding new macro-sites becomes increasingly difficult and can be expensive, especially in city centres. An alternative is to introduce small cells through the addition of low-power base stations (eNBs, HeNBs or Relay Nodes (RNs)) or Remote Radio Heads (RRH) to existing macro-eNBs. Site acquisition is easier and cheaper with this equipment which is also correspondingly smaller.\n\nSmall cells are primarily added to increase capacity in hot spots with high user demand and to fill in areas not covered by the macro network - both outdoors and indoors. They also improve network performance and service quality by offloading from the large macro-cells. The result is a heterogeneous network with large macro-cells in combination with small cells providing increased bitrates per unit area. See Figure 1.\n\nHeterogeneous network planning was already used in GSM. The large and small cells in GSM are separated through the use of different frequencies. This solution is still possible in LTE. However, LTE networks mainly use a frequency reuse of one to maximize utilization of the licensed bandwidth.\n\nIn heterogeneous networks the cells of different sizes are referred to as macro-, micro-, pico- and femto-cells; listed in order of decreasing base station power. The actual cell size depends not only on the eNB power but also on antenna position, as well as the location environment; e.g. rural or city, indoor or outdoor . The HeNB (Home eNB) was introduced in LTE Release 9 (R9). It is a low power eNB which is mainly used to provide indoor coverage, femto-cells, for Closed Subscriber Groups (CSG), for example, in office premises. See Figure 2.\n\nSpecific to HeNBs, is that they are privately owned and deployed without coordination with the macro-network. If the frequency used in the femto-cell is the same as the frequency used in the macro-cells, and the femto-cell is only used for CSG, then there is a risk of interference between the femto-cell and the surrounding network.\n\nThe Relay Node (RN) is another type of low-power base station added to the LTE R10 specifications. The RN is connected to a Donor eNB (DeNB) via the Un radio interface, which is based on the LTE Uu interface. See Figure 2. When the frequencies used on Uu and Un for the RN are the same, there is a risk of self interference in the RN. From the UE perspective the RN will act as an eNB, and from the DeNB's view the RN will be seen as a UE. As also mentioned, RRHs connected to an eNB via fibre can be used to provide small cell coverage.\n\nIntroducing a mix of cell sizes and generating a heterogeneous network adds to the complexity of network planning. In a network with a frequency reuse of one, the UE normally camps on the cell with the strongest received DL signal (SSDL), hence the border between two cells is located at the point where SSDL is the same in both cells. In homogeneous networks, this also typically coincides with the point of equal path loss for the UL (PLUL) in both cells. In a heterogeneous network, with high-power nodes in the large cells and low-power nodes in the small cells, the point of equal SSDL will not necessarily be the same as that of equal PLUL. See Figure 3.\n\nA major issue in heterogeneous network planning is to ensure that the small cells actually serve enough users. One way to do that is to increase the area served by the small cell, which can be done through the use of a positive cell selection offset to the SSDL of the small cell. This is called Cell Range Extension (CRE). See Figure 4.\n\nA negative effect of this is the increased interference on the DL experienced by the UE located in the CRE region and served by the base station in the small cell. This may impact the reception of the DL control channels in particular.\n\nA number of features added to the 3GPP LTE specification can be used to mitigate the above-mentioned interference problem in heterogeneous networks with small cells:\n\nICIC was introduced in R8. The eNBs can communicate using ICIC via the X2 interface to mitigate inter-cell interference for UEs at the cell edge. The X2AP message used for this is called \"Load Information\". See Figure 5. Through the \"Load Information\" message an eNB can inform neighbouring eNBs about: UL interference level per Physical Resource Block (PRB); UL PRBs that are allocated to cell edge UEs, and hence are sensitive to UL interference; and if DL Tx power is higher or lower than a set threshold value. The eNBs receiving these messages can use the received information to optimize scheduling for UEs at cell edges.\n\nICIC has evolved to better support heterogeneous network deployments -- especially interference control for DL control channels. Enhanced ICIC (eICIC) was introduced in LTE R10. The major change is the addition of time domain ICIC, realized through use of Almost Blank Subframes (ABS). ABS includes only control channels and cell-specific reference signals, no user data, and is transmitted with reduced power. When eICIC is used, the macro-eNB will transmit ABS according to a semi-static pattern. During these subframes, UEs at the edge, typically in the CRE region of small cells, can receive DL information, both control and user data. The macro-eNB will inform the eNB in the small cell about the ABS pattern. See Figure 6.\n\nICIC is evolved in LTE R11 to further enhanced ICIC (feICIC). The focus here is interference handling by the UE through inter-cell interference cancellation for control signals, enabling even further cell range extension.\n\neICIC and feICIC are especially important when Carrier Aggregation (CA) is not used.\n\nCarrier Aggregation (CA) is introduced in R10, with backward compatibility to R8, to increase the total bandwidth available to UEs and hence their maximum bitrates. When CA is used a number of R8 carriers, referred to as Component Carriers (CC), are aggregated and any CA-capable UE can be allocated resources on all CCs, while R8/R9 UEs can only be allocated resources on one CC. Cross-carrier scheduling is an important feature in heterogeneous networks. Using cross-carrier scheduling it is possible to map the Physical DL control channels (PDCCH) on different CCs in the large and small cells. See Figure 7. The PDCCH, carrying DL Control Information (DCI) with scheduling information, must be received by the UEs at the cell edge; PDCCH may be transmitted with higher power than the traffic channels. Hence, using different carriers for the PDCCH in the large and small cells reduces the risk of PDCCH interference.\n\nFrom LTE R11 onwards it is possible to handle CA with CCs requiring different timing advance (TA); for example, combining CCs from eNBs with CCs from RRHs. See Figure 8.\n\nOne way to ensure that a UE is using both the best DL and the best UL carrier in a heterogeneous network is to use CoMP, introduced in LTE R11. With CoMP a number of transmission/reception points (i.e. eNBs, RNs or RRHs) can be coordinated to provide service to a UE - for example, data can be transmitted at the same time in the same PRBs from more than one transmission point to one UE, or data can be received from one transmission point in one subframe and from another transmission point in the next subframe. CoMP can be used both in DL and UL. When CoMP is used in a heterogeneous network a number of macro-cells and small cells can be involved in data transmission to and from one UE. Especially useful in heterogeneous networks is the possibility for a UE in the cell range extension region to utilize the best UL in the small cell and the best DL in the macro-cell. See Figure 9. This, however, requires that the macro-eNB and the base station in the small cell are synchronized, and most likely it will require a combination of macro-eNB with RRHs in the small cell.\n\nFurther enhancements regarding heterogeneous network and small cells are coming in future 3GPP Releases. At the time of writing, Release 12 is still in the process of being formulated with some features in the study phase and others, such as work on interference management for neighbour TDD cells, dual connectivity between the macro cell and small cells, mobility planning within hyper-dense environments and advances in carrier aggregation combinations already in the normative phase (specifications).\n\nFuture updates to this paper will include what has been achieved with the completion of Release 12 during the second half of 2014.\n\n\"...Coordinating the low-power layer of small cells with the macro network improves performance across the entire network while also further boosting efficiencies in spectrum use and power consumption, automating network configuration and optimization. The upcoming 3GPP Release 12 (due to be frozen September 2014) standardises various capabilities in these developments including dual connectivity, small cell on/off and 256 QAM...\" ...Read the full article",

There are two types of Secondary CCPCH: those that include TFCI and those that do not include TFCI. It is the UTRAN that determines if a TFCI should be transmitted, hence making it mandatory for all UEs to support the use of TFCI. The set of possible rates for the Secondary CCPCH is the same as for the downlink DPCH, see subclause 5.3.2. The frame structure of the Secondary CCPCH is shown in figure 17.\n\nThe parameter k in figure 17 determines the total number of bits per downlink Secondary CCPCH slot. It is related to the spreading factor SF of the physical channel as SF = 256/2k. The spreading factor range is from 256 down to 4.\n\nThe values for the number of bits per field are given in Table 18. The channel bit and symbol rates given in Table 18 are the rates immediately before spreading. The slot formats applicable to QPSK with pilot bits are not supported in this release. The pilot patterns for the slot formats applicable to QPSK are given in Table 19. DTX shall be used in the pilot field of the 16QAM slot formats, i.e. no pilot bits are used in this release. A BCH mapped to Secondary CCPCH uses the specific fixed Secondary CCPCH slot format in Table 18, and this slot format can only be used for carrying BCH.\n\nThe FACH and PCH can be mapped to the same or to separate Secondary CCPCHs. If FACH and PCH are mapped to the same Secondary CCPCH, they can be mapped to the same frame. A BCH mapped to Secondary CCPCH can only be mapped to a separate Secondary CCPCH without multiplexing with other transport channels. The main difference between a CCPCH and a downlink dedicated physical channel is that a CCPCH is not inner-loop power controlled. The main difference between the Primary and Secondary CCPCH is that the transport channel mapped to the Primary CCPCH (BCH) can only have a fixed predefined transport format combination, while the Secondary CCPCH supports multiple transport format combinations on the transport channels mapped to it and offers the possibility of using TFCI.\n\nNOTE 1: The slot formats 18 to 23 in Table 18 are only applicable for MBSFN operations with 16QAM.\n\nNOTE 2: The modulation used in MBSFN operations is signalled by higher layers.\n\nThe pilot symbol pattern described in Table 19 is not supported in this release. The shadowed part can be used as frame synchronization words. (The symbol pattern of pilot symbols other than the frame synchronization word shall be \"11\"). In Table 19, the transmission order is from left to right. (Each two-bit pair represents an I/Q pair of QPSK modulation.)\n\nFor slot formats using TFCI, the TFCI value in each radio frame corresponds to a certain transport format combination of the FACHs and/or PCHs currently in use. This correspondence is (re-)negotiated at each FACH/PCH addition / removal. The mapping of the TFCI bits onto slots is described in [3].",

In session based charging, at least two chargeable events are needed, one each to describe the start and the end of the session, respectively. Multiple interim events are possible in order to describe changes to session characteristics (generally termed \"change of charging condition\", e.g. tariff time switch, change of PDP context QoS or change of IMS session media types), or when certain limits, e.g. time or volume, are exceeded. The CTF transforms each chargeable event into a charging event and forwards these charging events to the CDF in real-time.\n\nThe relation between chargeable events and charging events is 1:1. For event based charging, the relation between charging events and CDRs is 1:1. For session based charging, the relation between charging events and CDRs is m:n with m >=n.

Well... let's just pick what we are interested in for now as I suggested above.\n\nOne thing you have to notice in this diagram is that the line does not have any arrow head. It does not mean that the line is always bidirection. Some line means uni-directional and some line means bi-directional. In this case, PCCH and BCCH are unidirectional, downlink only. CCCH is bidirectional which means both for downlink and uplink.\n\nAnother tip of understanding this diagram is to correlate this diagram to MAC PDU structure of each channel that is following this diagram (In 25.321, they are quite a far apart.. so you may lose mental connection between the two).\n\nThe end result of most of the procedure shown in the above figure is adding or removing a special portions in MAC header.\n\nThe first path we are thinking of is PCCH path which is downlink only and carries Paging message (Paging Type 1). 25.321 9.2.1.3 MAC header for PCCH says \"There is no MAC header for PCH\". (The spec says PCH would have MAC-ehs when the PCH is mapped on HS-DSCH, but this does not happen in the MAC component being discussed in this section).\n\nNext path is BCCH path which is downlink only and carries MIB and SIBs. It can create one of the following three cases, but the case produced by the MAC component shown in this section is Case a) which does not have any MAC header. I means that it is going through TCTF MUX block without any modification. (Refer to 25.321 9.2.1.2 MAC header for BCCH for case b) and case c).\n\nEven though PCCH, BCCH path does not have any MAC header in this process and MAC layer still do something for this channel. It is TFC (Transport format Combination) Selection. MAC-c/sh select a proper TFCI and pass it to transport layer and then the transport layer encode PCH, BCH data into PHY layer format.\n\nNext Path is RACH to CCCH path (Uplink) and CCCH to FACH path (downlink). RRC Connection Request is going through RACH to CCCH path and RRC Connection Setup is going through CCCH to FACH path. This path is dealing with the following MAC PDU structure. In CCCH to FACH path, MAC-c/sh adds TCTF to MAC SDU. In RACH to CCCH path, MAC-c/sh check TCTF value and remove it and then distribute the SDU accordingly to higher layer.\n\n< 25.321 - Table 9.2.1.2 : Coding of the Target Channel Type Field on FACH for FDD >\n\n< 25.321 - Table 9.2.1.4 : Coding of the Target Channel Type Field on RACH for FDD >\n\nFollowing is MAC-c/sh/m for UE side, but analysis logic and most of the detailed information is same as in UTRAN. The only thing you have to be careful about is direction of the path. For example, in this case, PCCH path is from the bottom (PCH) to UP (PCCH). CCCH path is also 'FACH to CCCH' or 'CCCH to RACH' which is opposite direction of UTRAN case.",

In contrast to LTE, OFDM can also be used in the NR uplink (UL) direction. As a complement waveform with lower peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) to improve UL coverage, DFT-s-OFDM (OFDM with Discrete Fourier Transform precoding) can be used in the uplink although limited to single-layer transmission only.\n\nTo cope with various deployment scenarios, NR supports a wide range of carrier frequencies (within two possible ranges) and channel bandwidths, as shown in the table below.\n\nTo allow for such a flexibility, NR uses a flexible frame structure, with different Subcarrier Spacings (SCS). The SCS is the distance between the centres of two consecutive subcarriers, and the possible values for SCS are (in kHz): 15; 30; 60; 120 and 240. This is referred to as \"multiple numerologies\".\n\nA consecutive series of 12 subcarriers forms one Resource Block (RB). An NR channel bandwidth consists of a number of RBs. A Resource Element (RE) is defined as a unit of one subcarrier (frequency domain) and one OFDM symbol (time domain).\n\nAs for the time domain, it is divided in 10ms radio frames, each on consisting in 10 subframes of 1ms each, as shown in the picture below.\n\nIn turn, each subframe consists of 1/2/4/8/16 slots -shown in different colors- depending on the selected SCS/numerology.  The figure shows the cases of SCS values of 15; 30; 60 and 120 KHz, while the table below provides the full list of possible numerologies in NR. As shown in the figure for the 15 kHz case, each slot consists of 14 OFDM symbols (independently of the SCS) preceded by a cyclic prefix (CP).\n\nNote that, for the 60 kHz SCS, an extended CP is possible. The extended CP is approximately four times longer than the normal CP and is used for cells having large delay spread. In this case, one slot consists of only 12 OFDM symbols.\n\nThe OFDM symbol duration and CP length are inversely proportional of the SCS. E.g. for 15 kHz SCS, the OFDM symbol duration is approximately 66.6 µs and the CP length is approximately 4.7 µs. When the SCS is doubled, i.e. 30 kHz, the OFDM and CP lengths are approximately devided by two compared to the 15kHz SCS.\n\nNR supports both FDD and TDD operation with the same frame structure. In the case of TDD, and as to allow for flexible traffic adaptation, each OFDM symbol in a slot can be classified as 'downlink', 'uplink' or 'flexible' (i.e. either downlink or uplink). This can be configured semi-statically or it can change dynamically as part of the scheduling decision.\n\nTransmissions are usually carried out over one slot. In specific cases, transmissions can be carried out over only a fraction of a slot, with the minimum set to only two symbols. Such very short transmissions mainly target usage cases requiring low latency, such as some URLLC (Ultra Reliable, Low Latency) services.",

The process of directed retry involves the assignment of a UE/MS to a radio channel on a cell other than the serving cell. This process is triggered by the assignment procedures, as described in 3GPP TS 25.413, and employs UMTS to GSM handover procedures as described in subclauses 6.2.1 and 8.1. The successful procedure for a directed retry in case of an intra-3G_MSC UMTS to GSM handover is as shown in figure 40b and as described below.\nIf during the assignment phase, as represented by the Iu-RAB-ASSIGNMENT-REQUEST message, a UMTS to GSM handover becomes necessary, due to either radio conditions. congestion or network preference, then the UE/MS may be handed over to a GSM cell.

In a previous Rel-14 work item IQoE [1], this QoE functionality was enhanced for the DASH streaming specification TS 26.247 [2], giving the operator better possibilities to control such metrics feedback. The current Rel-15 work item EQoE_MTSI [3] introduced the same enhancements also to the MTSI specification TS 26.114 [4], keeping the QoE functionalities for DASH and MTSI services aligned.\n\nThe enhancements introduced by EQoE_MTSI in TS 26.114 are:\n\nReferences\n\nSummary based on the input provided by China Unicom, Huawei, China Telecom in RP-172192 revised in RP-181821.\n\nThe benefit of understanding customers' experience, e.g. throughput, data loss, latency, for streaming services has attracted operators' attention. ITU-T P.NATS has released the standards on the model and evaluation of MOS models for streaming services in December 2016. SA4 has specified information about Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP, DASH, services to be collected from the DASH application on the UE and agreed to support MDT enhancement option for both QoE metrics configuration and QoE metrics reporting [1].A WI on QoE Measurement Collection for streaming services in UTRAN was approved at RAN#73 and a 'container based solution' has been specified [2]. SA5 has studied the management solution for collection of QoE information and proposed use cases, potential requirements and possible solutions. A WI was approved to specify the function Management of QoE measurement collection [3].\n\nBased on the work above, the operators can collect and utilize the QoE measurement information of streaming services to better understand the user experience and optimize their network in E-UTRAN. This work item specified the core requirement for Quality of Experience (QoE) Measurement Collection for streaming services in E-UTRAN [4].\n\nThis feature enables the network to collect QoE measurement information from the UE. The feature is activated by Trace Function from the MDT framework. Both signalling based and management based initiation cases are allowed. For the signalling based case, the QoE Measurement Collection is initiated towards a specific UE from CN nodes using the MDT mechanism; for the management based case, the QoE Measurement Collection is initiated from OAM targeting an area (without targeting a specific UE).\n\nThe QoE measurement configuration from OAM or CN in E-UTRAN is included in a container of RRCConnectionReconfiguration message and forwarded to the UE similar to in UTRAN. For transferring the QoE measurement report, a new SRB4 and a new uplink RRC message \"application layer measurement report\" are introduced. SRB4 is configured via RRCConnectionReconfiguration meassage. A container in the new message is defined to send the QoE measurement report.\n\nThe QoE measurement configuration and measurement reporting are supported in RRC_CONNECTED state only. E-UTRAN can release the QoE measurement configuration towards the UE at any time. If not explicitly released by the eNB, QoE measurement will be continued in case of intra-eNB HO and inter-eNB HO and both source and target cell belong to defined same measurement reporting area.\n\nReferences",

There may be zero, one, or several uplink DPDCHs on each radio link.\n\nThe uplink DPCCH is used to carry control information generated at Layer 1. The Layer 1 control information consists of known pilot bits to support channel estimation for coherent detection, transmit power-control (TPC) commands, feedback information (FBI), and an optional transport-format combination indicator (TFCI). The transport-format combination indicator informs the receiver about the instantaneous transport format combination of the transport channels mapped to the simultaneously transmitted uplink DPDCH radio frame. There is one and only one uplink DPCCH on each radio link. The uplink DPCCH may also carry DL FET ACK/NACK signalling information for DL FET operation when DL_DCH_FET_Config = 1.\n\nThe uplink DPCCH2 is used to carry control information generated at Layer 1. The Layer 1 control information consists of known pilot bits to support channel estimation for coherent detection, and transmit power-control (TPC) commands. When DPCCH2 is configured there is one and only one uplink DPCCH2 for all radio links. When DPCCH2 is configured, the UE shall transmit DPCCH2 only in the slots in which DPCCH is transmitted.\n\nThe uplink S-DPCCH is used to carry control information generated at Layer 1. The Layer 1 control information consists of known pilot bits to support channel sounding and channel estimation for coherent detection. There is up to one uplink S-DPCCH on each radio link in the case that UL_CLTD_Enabled as defined in [5] is TRUE. Figure 1 shows the frame structure of the uplink DPDCH, the uplink DPCCH, the uplink DPCCH2 and the uplink S-DPCCH. Each radio frame of length 10 ms is split into 5 subframes, each of 3 slots, each of length Tslot = 2560 chips, corresponding to one power-control period. The DPDCH, DPCCH, S-DPCCH and DPCCH2 are always frame aligned with each other.\n\nThe parameter k in figure 1 determines the number of bits per uplink DPDCH slot. It is related to the spreading factor SF of the DPDCH as SF = 256/2k. The DPDCH spreading factor may range from 256 down to 4. The spreading factor of the uplink DPCCH, the uplink DPCCH2 and the uplink S-DPCCH is always equal to 256, i.e. there are 10 bits per uplink DPCCH/S-DPCCH/DPCCH2 slot.\n\nThe exact number of bits of the uplink DPDCH and the different uplink DPCCH fields (Npilot, NTFCI, NFBI, and NTPC) is given by table 1 and table 2. What slot format to use is configured by higher layers and can also be reconfigured by higher layers. The exact number of bits of the uplink S-DPCCH is given by table 2A.\n\nThe uplink DPCCH2 reuses slot format #1 of DPCCH, and the exact number of bits is given in table 2.\n\nThe channel bit and symbol rates given in table 1, table 2 and table 2A are the rates immediately before spreading. The pilot patterns are given in table 3 and table 4, the TPC bit pattern is given in table 5.\n\nThe FBI bits are used to support techniques requiring feedback from the UE to the UTRAN Access Point for operation of closed loop mode transmit diversity. The use of the FBI bits is described in detail in [5].\n\nThere are two types of uplink dedicated physical channels; those that include TFCI (e.g. for several simultaneous services) and those that do not include TFCI (e.g. for fixed-rate services). These types are reflected by the duplicated rows of table 2. It is the UTRAN that determines if a TFCI should be transmitted and it is mandatory for all UEs to support the use of TFCI in the uplink. The mapping of TFCI bits onto slots is described in [3].\n\nDPCCH slot format 5 is used when DL_DCH_FET_Config is configured by higher layers. In this case, over a 20ms Compression Interval (CI) consisting of 30 slots, the bits in the TFCI field carry TFCI information in the first 10 slots, and may carry an ACK/NACK indicator for DL FET in the remaining 20 slots. The ACK/NACK for DL FET is sent when DL_DCH_FET_Config = 1.\n\nIn compressed mode, DPCCH slot formats with TFCI fields are changed. There are two possible compressed slot formats for normal slot formats 0 and 2. They are labelled A and B and the selection between them is dependent on the number of slots that are transmitted in each frame in compressed mode. When DL_DCH_FET_Config is configured by higher layers, UL DPCCH slot format 5 is used in compressed mode. In compressed mode when UL_DCH_FET_Config is configured by higher layers, TFCI bits represent TFCI information in the first 10 slots that are not in compressed-mode gaps in a 20ms CI. The TFCI bits in subsequent slots that are not in the compressed mode gaps represent ACK/NACK indication for DL FET when DL_DCH_FET_Config = 1.\n\nIf UL_DTX_Active is TRUE (see [5]), the number of transmitted slots per radio frame may be less than the number shown in Table 2 and Table 2A.\n\nThe pilot bit pattern for S-DPCCH is the same as that for uplink DPCCH with Npilot = 8. The Nfixed bits in the S-DPCCH are fixed to \"10\".\n\nThe pilot bit pattern for DPCCH2 is the same as that for uplink DPCCH with Npilot = 8.\n\nThe pilot bit patterns are described in table 3 and table 4. The shadowed column part of pilot bit pattern is defined as FSW and FSWs can be used to confirm frame synchronization. (The value of the pilot bit pattern other than FSWs shall be \"1\".)\n\nThe relationship between the TPC bit pattern and transmitter power control command is presented in table 5.\n\nMulti-code operation is possible for the uplink dedicated physical channels. When multi-code transmission is used, several parallel DPDCH are transmitted using different channelization codes, see [4]. However, there is only one DPCCH per radio link, one DPCCH2 if DPCCH2 is configured and up to one S-DPCCH in the case that UL_CLTD_Enable is TRUE.\n\nA period of uplink DPCCH transmission prior to the start of the uplink DPDCH transmission (uplink DPCCH power control preamble) shall be used for initialisation of a DCH. The length of the power control preamble is a higher layer parameter, Npcp , signalled by the network [5]. The UL DPCCH shall take the same slot format in the power control preamble as afterwards, as given in table 2. When Npcp > 0 the pilot patterns of table 3 and table 4 shall be used. The timing of the power control preamble is described in [5], subclause 4.3.2.3. The TFCI field is filled with \"0\" bits.",

The location information for each MS is stored in functional units called location registers. Functionally, there are two types of location registers:\nSee also 3GPP TS 23.002 where the network architecture is described, and 3GPP TS 23.008 where the data stored in the location registers are described.\nThe action taken by a MS in order to provide location information to the PLMN will be referred to as location updating.\n2.2\tLocation area and MSC area\nThe MSC area is composed of the area covered by all base stations controlled by the MSC. An MSC area may consist of several location areas. A location area is an area in which, after having performed a location update once, MSs may roam without being required to perform subsequent location updates for reason of location change. A location area consists of one or more cells.\n\nFor further details of the network architecture, see 3GPP TS 23.002.\n2.3\tLocation area identification\nThe Location Area Identification (LAI) plan is part of the base station identification plan. The base stations are identified uniquely (see 3GPP TS 23.003).\n2.4\tIMSI detach/attach operation\nThe support of IMSI detach/attach operation is mandatory in MSs. The facility is optional in the fixed infrastructure of the PLMN.\n2.4.1\tExplicit IMSI detach/attach\nExplicit IMSI detach operation is the action taken by an MS to indicate to the PLMN that the station has entered an inactive state (e.g. the station is powered down). Explicit IMSI attach operation is the action taken by an MS to indicate that the station has re-entered an active state (e.g. the station is powered up).\n2.4.2\tImplicit IMSI detach\n\nImplicit IMSI detach operation is the action taken by the VLR to mark an MS as detached when there has been no successful contact between the MS and the network for a time determined by the implicit detach timer. The value of the implicit detach timer is derived from the periodic location updating timer; when the MSC/VLR applies Mobility Management Congestion Control to a MS, the MSC/VLR may need to adjust the Implicit Detach timer as specified in clause 3.7.2. During an established radio contact, the implicit detach timer shall be prevented from triggering implicit detach. At the release of the radio connection, the implicit detach timer shall be reset and restarted. Implicit IMSI detach shall also be performed in the case of a negative response to an IMEI check.\n2.5\tUse of the term mobile station (MS) in the present document\n\nIn order to simplify the text the term Mobile Station (MS) as used in relation to location management refers to the entity where the IMSI is stored, i.e., in card operated MSs the term Mobile Station (MS) refers to the card.\n2.6\tPaging area\nAs an option, and for paging optimization purpose, the VLR may control Paging Areas. A Paging Area (PgA) is composed of up to 5 Location Areas, and the MSC area is composed of several Paging Areas. Paging areas may overlap each other. The Paging Area is stored in the HLR and updated at each paging area change. The Paging Area is sent by the HLR to the VLR at roaming number request and may be used by the MSC/VLR for paging (e.g. when LAI is not known, after MSC/VLR restart) (see 3GPP TS 23.018 [5a]).",

General concepts about transport channels are described in [12].\n\nA transport channel is defined by how and with what characteristics data is transferred over the air interface. A general classification of transport channels is into two groups:\n\n4.1.1\tDedicated transport channels\n\nThere exists two types of dedicated transport channel, the Dedicated Channel (DCH) and the Enhanced Dedicated Channel (E-DCH).\n\n4.1.1.1\tDCH - Dedicated Channel\n\nThe Dedicated Channel (DCH) is a downlink or uplink transport channel. The DCH is transmitted over the entire cell or over only a part of the cell using e.g. beam-forming antennas.\n\n4.1.1.2\tE-DCH - Enhanced Dedicated Channel\n\nThe Enhanced Dedicated Channel (E-DCH) is an uplink transport channel in CELL DCH.\n\n4.1.2\tCommon transport channels\n\nThere are six types of common transport channels: BCH, FACH, PCH, RACH, HS-DSCH and E-DCH.\n\n4.1.2.1\tBCH - Broadcast Channel\n\nThe Broadcast Channel (BCH) is a downlink transport channel that is used to broadcast system- and cell-specific information. The BCH is always transmitted over the entire cell and has a single non-zero transport format. In cells configured with broadcast distribution, a first BCH mapped to P-CCPCH is always present and one additional BCH mapped to S-CCPCH can be configured.\n\n4.1.2.2\tFACH - Forward Access Channel\n\nThe Forward Access Channel (FACH) is a downlink transport channel. The FACH is transmitted over the entire cell. The FACH can be transmitted using power setting described in [16].\n\n4.1.2.3\tPCH - Paging Channel\n\nThe Paging Channel (PCH) is a downlink transport channel. The PCH is always transmitted over the entire cell. The transmission of the PCH is associated with the transmission of physical-layer generated Paging Indicators, to support efficient sleep-mode procedures.\n\n4.1.2.4\tRACH - Random Access Channel\n\nThe Random Access Channel (RACH) is an uplink transport channel. The RACH is always received from the entire cell.

The UE may request measurement gaps from a gNB using the procedure described in clause 7.4.1.1. If the UE is not aware of the SFN of at least one E-UTRA TP in the OTDOA assistance data, the UE may use autonomous gaps to acquire SFN of the E-UTRA OTDOA reference cell prior to requesting measurement gaps for performing the requested E-UTRA RSTD measurements.\n\nThe UE while connected to a ng-eNB may require measurement gaps to perform inter-frequency RSTD measurements for OTDOA from E-UTRA TPs (see TS 38.133 [32]).

    "context": "https://www.3gpp.org/technologies/keywords-acronyms/105-son\n\nSON\n\nSON solutions can be divided into three categories: Self-Configuration, Self-Optimisation and Self-Healing. The SON architecture can be a centralized, distributed or a hybrid solution.\n\nThis is the dynamic plug-and-play configuration of newly deployed eNBs. The eNB will by itself configure the Physical Cell Identity, transmission frequency and power, leading to faster cell planning and rollout.\n\nThe interfaces S1 and X2 are dynamically configured, as well as the IP address and connection to IP backhaul. To reduce manual work ANR (Automatic neighbour relations) is used. ANR configures the neighbouring list in newly deployed eNBs and is optimizing the list configuration during operation.\n\nDynamic configuration includes the configuration of the Layer 1 identifier, Physical cell identity (PCI) and Cell global ID (CGID). There are 504 different PCIs available in LTE, the PCI mapping shall fulfill the collision free condition as well as the confusion free. The PCI can be assigned either in a centralized or distributed way.\n\nWhen centralised assignment is used the OAM system will have a complete knowledge and control of the PCIs. When the distributed solution is used the OAM system assigns a list of possible PCIs to the newly deployed eNB, but the adoption of the PCI is in control of the eNB. The newly deployed eNB will request a report, sent either by User Equipment (UEs) over the air interface or by other eNBs over the X2 interface, including already in-use PCIs, see figure 1. - The eNB will randomly select its PCI from the remaining values.\n\nANR is used to minimize the work required for configuration in newly deployed eNBs as well as to optimize configuration during operation. Correct and up-to-date neighbouring lists will increase the number of successful handovers and minimize the number of dropped calls. Before a handover can be executed the source eNB requires the neighbouring information: PCI and CGID of the target eNB.\n\nThe PCI is included in every normal measurement report. The mapping between the PCI and CGID parameters can be done by using information from the OAM or reported by UEs decoding the target cell CGID on the broadcast channel in the target cell, see figure 2. The capability of decoding CGID is an optional UE feature.\n\nA network operator can put a cell on a ANR black list, to block certain handover candidates, for example from indoor to outdoor cells. 3GPP has also specified LTE Inter-Frequency and Inter-RAT (Radio Access Technology) ANR.\n\nFunctions for self-optimisation are mainly included in Release 9. It includes optimisation of coverage, capacity, handover and interference.\n\nMobility load balancing (MLB) is a function where cells suffering congestion can transfer load to other cells, which have spare resources. MLB includes load reporting between eNBs to exchange information about load level and available capacity.\n\nThe periodicity of the reporting can be requested in the range of 1 to 10 s. The report can contain, hardware load, S1 transport network load and Radio resource status. The Radio resource status reports are separated in Up Link and Down Link reports, including the total allocation guaranteed and non-guaranteed bit rate traffic, the percentage of allocated Physical Resource Block (PRB) and the percentage of PRBs available for load balancing.\n\nMLB can also be used between different Radio Technologies. In case of inter-RAT the load reporting RAN Information Management (RIM) protocol will be used to transfer the information via the core between the base stations of different radio technologies. A cell capacity class value, set by the OAM-system, will be used to compare and weigh the different technologies radio capacities against each other.\n\nA handover due to load balancing is carried out as a regular handover, but it may be necessary to amend parameters so that the User Equipment (UE) does not return to the congested cell. The amendment must take place in both cells, so that the handover settings remain coherent in both. The eNBs need to estimate how much the cell border needs to be shifted, expressed in dB, to avoid a quick return of the UE.\n\nMobility robustness optimization (MRO) is a solution for automatic detection and correction of errors in the mobility configuration. In Release 9 the focus is on errors causing Radio link failure (RLF) due to too late or early handover, or handover to an incorrect cell.\n\nIn case of late handover, see figure 3, the handover procedure in the source cell is initialized too late, since the UE is moving faster than the Handover (HO) parameter settings allow. Hence when the RRC HO command from the serving cell is transmitted the signal strength is too weak to reach the UE, now located in the target cell, connection is lost. The UE attempts a connection re-establishment, containing PCID and C-RNTI belonging to the source cell, but received by the target cell. The target eNB will then inform the source cell about RLF to adjust Handover parameters.\n\nIt is a bit more complicated to detect a too early handover, see figure 4. The UE has successfully been handed over from source cell A to target cell B, but since it was triggered too early the connection will drop almost immediately due to too poor radio conditions in the target cell B. The UE will then try to re-establish the connection, which will now take place in the original source cell, cell A, since this cell is the strongest one. The UE will use the PCID and RNTI from the target cell B and the source cell A will then consider this as a Radio Link Failure due to too late handover and send an indication to the target cell B. But the target cell B will now recognize the parameters in the indication, as given to a mobile that had just completed a handover to cell B from cell A now indicating failure. The target cell B will send back a report about too early Handover to adjust Handover parameters, to the source cell A.\n\nIn order to save energy some cells can be switched off when capacity is not needed. The power consumption in a base station is not only related to load, a number of functions requires power even if there are no users to serve. But, if a cell is switched off, in the legal operator license there are still requirements on coverage, the coverage must be maintained at all times! The suspension of the cell may occur when the last user leaves the cell, all incoming handovers during this period of time will then be rejected. The cells that remain on, providing coverage, can wake up a suspended cell when traffic load increase. This can be done with a wake-up call to the sleeping cell.\n\nRACH optimisation aims to minimise the number of attempts on the RACH channel, causing interference. The UE can be polled by the eNB for RACH statistics after connection. The number of preambles sent until successful RACH completion, and the number of contention resolution failure are in the statistics. But PRACH configuration parameters can also be distributed amongst eNBs, like zero correlation configuration, root sequence, high speed flag and PRACH frequency offset.\n\nFeatures for automatic detection and removal of failures and automatic adjustment of parameters are mainly specified in Release 10.\n\nCoverage and Capacity Optimization enables automatic correction of capacity problems depending on slowly changing environment, like seasonal variations.\n\nMinimization of drive tests (MDT), is enabling normal UEs to provide the same type of information as those collected in drive test. A great advantage is that UEs can retrieve and report parameters from indoor environments.",

Tech.: Time Invarience\n\nTime Invarience means \"The output from a system does not change depending on when you put the input to the system\". It means that if you put a same input to the system, you would get the same output regardless of when you put the input to the system.\n\nThis can be illustrated as shown below. Upper track shows an input at a certain time and the output from the system. Lower track shows the exactly same input but only time to go intot the system is different from the upper track. What is the difference in terms of output between upper track and lower track ? As you see, the output is the exactly same except the time you get it. It means just\ntime-shifting input to this system does not change the output. This kind of system is called Time Invarient system.\n\nThe answer is pretty obvious. Let's suppose you have a system which is Time Varient. You put a certain input and investigated all the characteristics of the input with a lot of time and effort. But you would not be able to reuse the result because when you reuse it, time is different and the result will be different as well. It is like... you have a computer. you would get different result from an exactly same program every time you run it.\n\nThe only case you can reuse the result is to make a lot of further efforts to find out the rules to show how the output changes depending on time. Unfortunately you cannot guarantee that you can find the rule. Even though you are lucky enough to find the rule, your model for the system will be extremly complicated.",

MCCore now supports a limited functional alias functionality, a role based addressing for railways. MCPTT now supports multi user talker control, an additional way of floor control allowing a defined number of talkers talking at the same time in a group communication rather than just one talker at a time.\n\nThis work initially started off in 2014 in the International Railway Union (UIC) by an activity to collect the user scenarios to be supported by a Future Railway Communication System (FRMCS). As those user scenarios could not be mapped easily onto use cases in 3GPP based on the input of the UIC a Technical Report (TR22.889) was written summarising 3GPP style use cases, to come up with requirements for introduction in normative specifications.\n\nThe term FRMCS is used in UIC still and includes more than just the Mobile Communication System for Railways standardised by 3GPP, see figure below, the light gray dotted boxes are in scope of 3GPP. The darker gray cross hatched boxes are also taken care of by 3GPP in maintaining the GSM legacy.\n\nThe work item to introduce the findings of TR 22.889 into normative is called \"Mobile Communication System for Railways\" (MONASTERY) an adapts 3GPP to provide communication to railway users. The Mobile Communication System for Railways eventually will resemble GSM-R and other legacy system in use nowadays and will additionally provide communication capabilities beyond what those systems support. It will provide higher data rates, lower data latencies, multimedia communication, and improved communication reliability.\n\nTo facilitate smooth migration from legacy communication systems to the Mobile Communication System for Railways, interworking requirements between legacy communication systems and the Mobile Communication System for Railways are provided.\n\nAmongst others, Mobile Communication System for Railways provides emergency group communication, low latency and high reliable data and video service in high speed train environment. Amongst others it has the following important features:\n\nBasically, railway communication services can be categorized into:\n\nIn Rel-15 only two additions have been introduced to the Mission Critical Push To Talk (MCPTT) and the Mission Critical Core (MCCore) functionality.

It represents the bad-urban case where additional clusters are seen in the environment.  This model is limited to use with the urban macro-cell where the first cluster will be the primary cluster and the second will be the far scattering cluster (FSC). When the model is active, it will have the following characteristics:\n\nThere is a reduction in the number of paths in the primary cluster from N = 6 to N1 = 4, with the far scattering cluster then having N2 = 2.  Thus the total number of paths will stay the same, now N = N1 + N2 = 4 + 2.  This is a modification to the SCM channel generation procedure in Clause 5.3.\n\nThe FSCs will only be modeled for the serving cell, with 3 independent FSCs in the cell uniformly applied to the area of the cell outside the minimum radius.\n\nThe following is a generation procedure for the FSC model and is used in conjunction with the normal channel generation procedure in Clause 5.3.\n\nStep 1. Drop the MS within test cell. Step 2. Drop three FS clusters uniformly across the cell hexagon, with a minimum radius of R = 500m. Step 3. Choose the FS cluster to use for the mobile that is closest to the mobile. Step 4. Generate 6 delays Step 5. Sort in order of increasing delays, Step 6. Subtract shortest delay of  from each of  Step 7. Sort  in the order of increasing delays, Step 8. Subtract shorter delay of from each of  Step 9. Assign powers to paths corresponding to all 6 delays: where  (n = 1,…,6) are i.i.d. Gaussian random variables with standard deviation = 3 dB. Step 10. Calculate excess path delay and add to  Step 11. Attenuate P5 and P6 by 1dB/s of excess delay with a 10dB maximum attenuation.  The excess delay will be defined as the difference in propagation time between the BS-MS LOS distance, and the BS-FSC-MS distance. Step 12. Scale each of the powers in the main cluster and in the FSC by a common log normal randomizing factor of 8dB/drawn once per cluster to represent the effect of the independent per cluster shadow fading after including site correlation of the mobile location. Step 13. Normalize powers of the 6 paths to unity power. Step 14. Select AoDs at the BS for the main cluster from the channel generation procedure in Clause 5.3.  Select AoDs at the BS for the FSC referenced to the direction of the FSC and selecting values from a Gaussian distribution with standard deviation rAS*mean(AS), where the mean(AS) is equal to 8 degrees or 15 degrees, chosen to match the angle spread model used. Step 15. Select AoAs at the MS using the equation in step 9 of Clause 5.3, where the 4 paths associated with the main cluster are referenced to the LOS direction to the BS, and the 2 paths associated with the FSC are referenced to the direction of the FSC.  The relative powers used are the normalized powers of step 13 of this clause. Step 16. Apply the bulk path loss and log normal to all 6 paths and apply the antenna gains accounting for the angles of the sub-paths associated with the main cluster and the FSC.",

Similarly, to the E-SMLC in the LTE architecture (TS 36.305 [25]), the LMF either includes or has an interface to an SPC function, as defined in OMA SUPL V2.0 ([15], [16]). It can thus provide a consistent set of positioning methods for deployments utilizing both control-plane and user-plane.\n\nThe interworking does not enable use of user-plane signalling for part of a control-plane positioning session. The user plane in the interworking here is not intended as an alternative path for control-plane signalling that would be needed between UE and NG-RAN for mechanisms such as A-GPS in a standalone control-plane solution.\n\nThis interworking does enable the SPC to retrieve measurements (e.g., GNSS-to-RAN time relations) from the NG-RAN.\n\nThe underlying architecture is shown in Figure A.2-1 (TS 23.501 [2]). Note that, for interworking between user-plane and control-plane positioning, no new interfaces need to be defined as compared to those in the figure, assuming the SPC is either integrated in the LMF or attached to it with a proprietary interface.\n\nThe Lup and Llp interfaces shown in this architecture are part of the user-plane solution only and are not required for control-plane positioning.",

Even though the radio access and the core network signalling in principle supports up to 11 bearers, the UE capability was limited only to 8 data bearers. Since LTE Rel-8 operators have launched a number of new services, and it has become more and more evident that more than 8 radio bearers will be needed to support simultaneously all the services. Without this extension there can be risk of inconsistent end user service behaviour that will ultimately prevent adding further QoS based services for a UE. It also worth noting that LTE Rel-8 has a restriction of having 8 AM bearers or 5AM+3 UM data bearers, which limits further availability for emerging differentiated data services. As an example, there can be user cases and scenarios where up to 4 RLC AM might be needed.\n\nIn response to the aforementioned limitations, TSG RAN agreed to instantiate a new LTE Rel-15 WI aiming to remove those restrictions by increasing the number of supported data radio bearers.\n\nLTE Rel-8 functionality is limited to 8 data radio bearers, which was never revised in later releases. And even though radio access and the core network signalling supports in principle up to 11 data bearers, MAC header design has logical channel ID space only for 8 bearers.\n\nRAN WG2 decided to extend the MAC header logical channel ID space from 32 to 64 code points, which allows for not only extending the number of supported data radio bearers, but also introduces a possibility to add more MAC control elements in the future. After extensive discussions between RAN and SA WGs, it was concluded to extend the number of supported data radio bearers to 15 to minimize impact to the existing information elements on the NAS and CN signalling. It is also worth noting that extended number of LTE data radio bearers is also aligned with the 5G/NR technology, in which the minimum UE requirement is to support 16 data radio bearers.\n\nAs for RAN WG3, it has been concluded that radio access interfaces already can support up to 15 data radio bearers. In addition it, there also exist procedures to handle various error cases when e.g. one eNB does not support as many bearers as has been configured by the source eNB. As a summary, no changes were introduced in RAN WG3.\n\nFinally, it bears mentioning that even though this WI aimed at increasing the number of data radio bearers for LTE connected to EPC, same enhancements can be supported by a UE supporting LTE connected to 5GC, i.e. architecture options 5 and 7. In those deployment cases when both LTE and NR are connected to the same 5GC, it allows operator to deploy and use same services irrespective of the radio access technology that a UE is configured with.",

This means that MSCB keeps control of the radio resources connection and release towards BSS-B. MSCB will do some processing on the BSSMAP information received on the E-interface or A-interface whereas it will relay the DTAP information transparently between Ainterface and E-interface. MSCA initiates and drives a subset of BSSMAP procedures towards MSCB, while MSCB controls them towards its BSSs to the extent that MSCB is responsible for the connections of its BSSs. The release of the dedicated resources between MSCB and BSS-B is under the responsibility of MSCB and BSSB, and is not directly controlled by MSCA. When clearing is to be performed due to information received from BSS-B, MSCB shall transfer this clearing indication to MSCA, to clear its connection with BSS-B, to terminate the dialogue with MSCA through the Einterface, and to release its circuit connection with MSCA, if any. In the same way, the release of the connection to its BSS-B, is initiated by MSCB, when the dialogue with MSCA ends normally and a release is received from the circuit connection with MSCA, if any, or when the dialogue with the MSCA ends abnormally.\n\nWhen a release is received by MSCB for the circuit connection with MSCA then MSCB shall release the circuit connection.\nIn the Inter-system Inter-MSC handover case, the role of MSCB (MSCB') is only to provide radio resources control within its area. This means that MSCB keeps control of the radio resources connection and release towards BSS-B. MSCB will do some processing on the BSSMAP information received on the E-interface or A-interface whereas it will relay the DTAP information transparently between Ainterface and E-interface. 3G_MSCA initiates and drives a subset of BSSMAP procedures towards MSCB, while MSCB controls them towards its BSSs to the extent that MSCB is responsible for the connections of its BSSs. The release of the dedicated resources between MSCB and BSS-B is under the responsibility of MSCB and BSSB, and is not directly controlled by 3G_MSCA.

If MSC-B supports handover to a CSG cell, the serving BSS is served by MSC-B and provides a CSG ID for the target cell, and the call is not an emergency call, then MSC-B checks the CSG membership of the UE for the target cell using the CSG subscription data provided by the anchor MSC-A or 3G_MSC-A during the basic inter-MSC handover before proceeding with the subsequent handover procedure. If there is no subscription data for this CSG ID or the CSG subscription for the CSG ID has expired, MSC-B considers the membership check as failed.\n\nFor subsequent handover of an emergency call to a CSG cell, MSC-B shall skip the CSG membership check and proceed with the handover procedure.\nFor subsequent inter-PLMN handover to a CSG cell, if the anchor MSC-A or 3G_MSC-A provided a CSG ID list for the target PLMN during the basic inter-MSC handover, MSC-B shall validate the CSG membership of the UE in the target CSG cell using the CSG ID list for the target PLMN.\nIf the anchor MSC-A or 3G_MSC-A provided only a CSG ID list for the PLMN of MSC-B, then based on operator's configuration the MSC-B may allow the handover by validating the CSG membership of the UE in the target CSG cell using this CSG ID list. Otherwise, MSC-B shall reject the handover due to no CSG subscription information of the target PLMN-ID available.\n4.2.2\tFunctional composition of MSCB and its interfaces for handover\n\nThe functional composition of an MSC acting as MSCB is essentially the same as that of MSCA.

Tech.: Coding\n\nIn this page, I will go through Matlab/Octave functions for communication system within a context of a whole process but in step-by-step manner. You would have seen many other resources elsewhere explaining on these functions, but most of the material that I have seen was purely for showing the syntax of each functions. So it was very hard for me to understand practical meaning of those functions\nwithin a whole communication process.\n\n(With Reference to Lec 2 | MIT 6.450 Principles of Digital Communications I, Fall 2006 (YouTube) )\n\nIt is because \"We want to implement Efficient process\". What do you mean by \"Effiecient process\" ? It may roughly mean \"a process to send data using as less number of bits as possible\" and \"a process to be guaranteed to work\". All that the thick text book is trying to say is \"How we can make the efficient process ?\", \"How do you represent it in mathemaical form ?\", \"How do you prove (in mathemtical way) that it is efficient and always work?\"\n\nIn real work, most of engineers doesn't care about this. There are only handsful of persons who digest all those textbook issues and come out with 'what they think is efficient process' and produce 'technical specification (e.g, 3GPP)'. Around 99% of us just follows the specification. That's why we don't read the text book after we graduate from university and still can survive -:)\n\nThere would be a couple of variations of the definitions of Source Coding depending on the context. The first type of definition is 'to convert the original data(user data) into a certain binary sequence' which is illustrated as below.\n\n(With Reference to Lec 2 | MIT 6.450 Principles of Digital Communications I, Fall 2006 (YouTube) )\n\nAnother type of definition for source coding (according to Ref [2]) is to convert a source data into a form that can minimize the bandwidth that are required to transmit the data. Simply put, it is just another name for 'Data Compression'.\n\nAgain, It doesn't look that complicated. Then why the text book about this is so thick ?\n\nChannel Coding is a method to replace 'original data bits' with 'some other bits (normally longer than the original bits)'. For example, the simplest coding would be as follows :\n\nAnother example of coding would be addition of parity bits as in RS 232 communication\n\nIn communication system, we usually call 'the original data' as a 'message' and call the ecoded data as 'Codeword'. In all encoding process, the length of Codeword is greater than the length of 'message', in means that in coding process some additional bits are added to the original data(message) and this additional bits are called 'redundency bits'.\n\nMost of the experts in this area would come out with something like 'Shannon's theorem'.. but let's just look at this in intuitive way rather than bringing up such a scary words.\n\nLet's look at the simple wireless communication process that we went through in previous section. In this process, what do you think is the biggest problem ?\n\nThe answer is the 'noise' which is added by 'Channel'. As you can guess, this noise would make a lot of errors while the reciever is demodulate the received signal into the bit stream.\n\nWhich option do you prefer ? You would know that the first option would be almost impossible especially in wireless communication. If it is wired communication, at least you can make some try to reduce the noise in the channel but in wireless it is almost impossible to remove the noise directly from the channel.\n\nIt means the only option is to develop some method (algorithm) to detect and correct the error caused by the noisy channel. This is the main motivation for 'Coding'.\n\nMain idea of Coding is to add some additional bits (we call this as redundancy bits) to original data in a very special way (not in a random/arbitrary way) so that they can be used to detect the exact location of error and correct it.\n\nIn communication chain, following two blocks are added for this purpose. 'Encoding' is the process of adding redundancy bits and 'Decoding' is the process of extracting the error corrected bits from the received data.\n\nUsually Encoding/Decoding blocks locate as shown below. Encoding takes in the bits stream and produce coded bit stream.\n\nGetting in further detail, this encoding often happens in two steps called Source Coding and Channel Coding, but in this post I will just describe this process as a single step.\n\nIn previous section, I said \"Encoding/Decoding is mainly for detecting/correcting erros generated in communication process\". It is very good and important step. But once you gain something, you would lose some other things. It is almost nature of everything including our life.\n\nWhat is the gain for Encoding/Decoding ? It is the received data with less or almost no error.\n\nWhat is the loss ? What is downside of this process ? Following are the major issues caused by Encoding/Decoding process.\n\nAs I said earlier, Coding is adding some redundancy bits to original data and these redundancy bits will be used to detect and correct error in decoding process. There are many different Encoding/Decoding algorithms which has it's own advantage and disadvantages. So we would always have the following question when we implement Coding/Decoding Blocks.\n\nIn general, the more redundancy bits you add, you would have higher error detection/correction capability. But the more redudancy bit you add, the less throughput you would get because larger portions of transmitted bits should be allocated for the redundancy bits, not for the information that you want to send. So you have to carefully determine how many bits you would allocate for the redundancy\nbits.\n\nFortunately in most mobile communication system, somebody else has already determined the answer to these questions. For example, in LTE or WCDMA system.. 3GPP specification specifies all the details of Encoding/Decoding process and you don't have to worry about these questions.\n\nFor example, in LTE case, 3GPP 36.212 specifies the Coding algorithm and related parameters as shown below. Chapter 5 of the specification provides all the detailed parameters to implement the coding process.\n\nFrom now, I will introduce some of the basic functions in Matlab/Octave related to Encoding/Decoding. My goal is to extend this section to Turbo Coding/Convolution Coding which is most widely used in mobile communication system, but I am not sure by when I can achieve this goal. Let's just start with the simple things first.\n\nBlock Code is an encoding method in which we split the whole input data stream into small blocks and replace the small block (Message) with another small block(Codeword).\n\nThis process can be illustrated as shown below. The small block getting into the Encoding function is called a 'message' and the block getting out of the Encoding function is called 'Codeword'. We also express this process in a symbol (n,k). n is the number of bits for codeword(output) and k is the number of bits for message (input). n is always greater than k, meaning the length of output\n(Codeword) is always longer than the length of input(Message).\n\nOne example of block code is as shown below. In this example, we split the input data stream into 4 bit chunks and replace each of the chunks with 7 bit chunk. The mapping table between each possible 4 bit chunk(input = message) and 7 bit chunk(output = codeword) is shown below.\n\n'Linear' when you say 'Linear Coding' means a set of code in which any linear combination (modular 2 sum) of two codes within the set results in a code which also belong to the original set. Let's assume that you have a set of codes as follows. Take out any two codes from the set and take modular 2 sum of them. The result is also a member of the set as shown below. Take any other two\ncodes and try yourself.\n\n'Cyclic' is a set of code in which a code can be generated by cyclic shift of another code in the set. or in other word, any number of cyclic shift of a code in the set also fall within the set. For example, let's assume that we have a code set which is made up of following four codes. If you look into each of these codes, you would notice that any of these codes can be created by the cyclic shift of another code as illustrated below.\n\nTake the code (0 1 0 1 0 1) and cyclic shift right by one and it gives (1 0 1 0 1 0) which is also a member of the set.\n\nTake the code (0 1 0 1 0 1) and cyclic shift right by two and it gives (0 1 0 1 0 1) which is also a member of the set.\n\nIn short, in this set .. whatever code you take and however many times you do cyclic shift, the result is always within the original set.\n\nReally, Is it true ? Can I use any arbitrary mapping table as pops up in my mind now ?\n\nYes, you can. but it doesn't mean that what you created in arbitrary way would be 'efficient' mapping (coding).\n\nThen what would be the efficient coding ? There may be multiple answers to this, but some common answer would be\n\nOne of the way to perform coding is to use what is called 'Generator Function'. You might come across this term in any kind of materials related to 'Coding'. My first response when I first heard of this function was 'What the hell, is it ?'. Is it something like those functions that we learned in high school ? It looks similar to what we learned in high school days.. e.g, g(x) = x^4 + x^2\n+ 1, but the way they are used looks pretty different from high school.\n\nI would not try to give you answer to these question here.. you will get it as you proceed. What I am trying to say is \"Don't feel yourself as stupid if you have the same questions\" -:).\n\nGenerator Function is a kind of 'Binary Function' which can perform 'coding' (Convering a message to a codeword) in following manner.\n\nExpressing the equation in more detailed form, it can be expressed as shown below.\n\nThe best way to understand the real meaning of the equation above would be by example. Here goes one example.\n\nyou can pack these equations into a matrix as shown below. (Note that the lowest order comes leftmost).\n\nNow, let's figure out codeword for this message (figure out the output bit stream when this message go through the encoder block). This is the point where we use the generator function shown above. The process to calculate the codeword using the generator function is as shown below.\n\nFor practice, try all the messages shown in overview section and check if your calculation matches the codewords in the section.\n\nNow let's take a high level view of generator function (generator matrix) and see if there is any recognizable pattern. It is as shown below.\n\ni) The number of rows is same as the length of message (number of bits in message)\n\nii) The matrix contains the k x k Identity matrix, where k is the length of the message\n\nNow you would ask another again. How can I get these generator functions ? (How can I know which generator functions I have to use ?). Don't worry.. in most case these functions/matrix will be given to you from the specification of the communication system. (Of course, there is theoretical background that justifies those generator functions given by the specification and you can refer to\nCommunication Text Books or surf on internet for it. I would not get further into it). In think, just understanding the meaning of the generator functions and how to use them to implement 'encoder' block would be enough in most case.\n\nNow let's look into the codebook we generated from higher level. As shown below, you would notice that the codebook contains the message part as it is at the end and redundant bits at the beginning. This is one of the characteristics of what we call 'linear block coding'.\n\nIt is hard to cleary explain what is the convolutional code is, but you would get a rough image if you think about the 'convolution' that you learned in your engineering math.\n\nRepresenting the convolutional coding process is not simple and clearly explained in short space. So I created a separate page for this(See ConvolutionalCode page).\n\n[1] Lec 2 | MIT 6.450 Principles of Digital Communications I, Fall 2006 (YouTube) )\n\n[2] SIMULATION OF DIGITAL COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS USING MATLAB By Mathuranathan Viswanathan",

    "context": "https://www.sharetechnote.com/html/Handbook_LTE_LTEU_LTER.html\n\nLTE Adv: LAA/LTE-U\n\nRecently (from 2014 as far as I remember), there has been pretty much discussion (even real testing going on) on LTE being extended to non-standard mode of operation (Non 3GPP yet at least up to this point, as of Jan 2015).\n\nNote : In early second half of 2016, I saw a company to try LTE-U device for the first timie, and as it approaches to the end of the year, I saw many companies testing LTE-U devices. Now in early 2017 we are at the stage of testing LAA.\n\nTwo of the technology falling into this category is LTE-U and LTE-R. LTE-U has been proposed and start being implemented in the industry for about a year and LTE-R just start being proposed as Integrated wireless railway network to be commercialized .\n\nAs of Jun 2016, I don't see/hear anything about LTE-R.. but I saw the drastic evolution of unlicensed LTE that created several different technologies (names) to the list. It started with LTE-U and evolved to LAA, eLAA and recently we are hearing of new branches like MulteFire and LWA. I don't know how many other technologies are waiting to be newly evolved and which of these technologies\nwill survive to the end.. some of them are now pretty well defined but there are a lot of other features to be defined technically. I will keep following them up and try to write down whatever has been clarified.\n\nFollowings are the brief descriptions for each of these technologies. I will put further details under separate section if more technical details are published. Also, I put many whitepapers and YouTube links under Reference section. I would recommend you to go through those materials when you have free time and use this page as reminder afterwards. (The contents of this table\nis mostly based on Ref [7] )\n\nFollowings are the list of topics that gives you further details of various LTE-Unlicensed technologies.\n\nIn every wireless communication, the communicating parties (transmitter and reciever) need to allocatie a certain amount of resources in both time domain and frequency domain. However, we don't have much control over frequency domain resource allocation because those resources are fixed permanently or semi-statically. So it is usually not in the scope of scheduling. When it comes to scheduling, Time Domain resource allocation tend to be more important.\n\nIn 3GPP based technology (i.e, Cellular Communication Technology like LTE), the time domain scheduling is obvious and determinstic even when there are many devices are in communication because all of the time domain resources determined by the central master (Base Station /Node B/eNode B). However, in 802.11 based technology(i.e LAN, Wireless LAN etc) there is no central controling master in terms of scheduling. In this case, there is always possibility that transmission signal from one device interfere with communication of other devices. To prevent (or at least reduce) this situation, we need a special algorithm for Time Domain Scheduling. Time Domain Scheduling in this case mean 'Determine when to transmit and how long it transmit'.\n\nThen why we need to care of this kind of thing in LTE-Unlicensed technology ? Basically LTE Unlicensed technology (e.g, LTE-U, LAA etc) refer to a technology in which LTE operates in 802.11 frequency region. So LTE need to keep the rule set by 802.11 in order not to prevent the communiction between existing 802.11 devices.\n\nThere are many variations of the time domain scheduling, but the basic idea and logic is same. Basic idea is 'Your transmission should not interfere with communication between others' and the basic logic is 'Before you transmit anything, check if the chennel(medium) is already being used by others'. This logic can be illustrated as follows.\n\nThen you may have some questions as follows : How to check (i.e, how to figure out) whether the channel (medium) is being used by other ? and how long the device need to check before it make any decision ?\n\nIn the effort to answer these questions, you will come across many terms that may confuse you for so long. I tried to list up those confusing words and how these are related to each other in following illustration. If you are new to this area, I would suggest you to understand 'what is CS and ED ?' first and then try to understand how CS / ED is used in higher level technology like CSMA/CD, CSMA/CA, CCS, LBT, CSAT etc. Already feel headache ? :)\n\nCS / ED : CS stands for Carrier Sensing and ED stands for Energy Detection. The fundamental concept is same. The term CS is more frequently used in 802.11 area especially for Wired LAN Area. In this technology, the device measures the energy level in the channel (medium) mostly in the form of voltage and compares the measured voltage with a specified value (threshold value). ED stands for Energy Detection. it is more frequently used in wireless/cellular technology. In this method, the device measures the energy level in the channel (medium) mostly in the form of Power and compares the measured power with a specified value (threshold value)\n\nCSMA/CD or CSMA/CA : As the term CSMA(Carrier Sensing Multiple Access) implies, these are technology of figuring out whether a channel is available or not based on CS method. You don't need to know the details of thechnology under the context of LTE-Unlicensed technology, but if you are really interested in thses method refer to CSMA/CD and CSMA/CA page.\n\nCCA : CCA stands for Clear Channel Assessment. As the word implies, this is a method to figure out the channel is clear (i.e, nobody is using the channel). CCA perform ED(Energy Detection) for a certain period of time and make a decision whether the channel is clear or not. It is a common method being used in 802.11 (WLAN) technology.\n\nHow long CCA perform ED before it make decision ? It depends on higher layer technology (e.g, 802.11 FHSS, 802.11 OFDM, LBT). However, the minimum time span is 18 us sec.\n\nWhat is the threshold energy level to make decision whether the channel is being used by some other device or not ? This also varies depending on power class of the device and reciever antenna gain. However, the base threshold is -70 dBm.\n\nNOTE : Refer to 802.11 specification and ETSI EN 300 328 if you want to get full details and requirement for CCA.\n\nLBT: LBT stands for Listen Before Talk. According to ETSI EN 300 328, LBT is defined as 'mechanism by which an equipment applies clear channel assessment (CCA) before using the channel' (In this document, you can find a couple of variations of LBT depending on different situations). As you see in the terminology itself, 'Listen Before Talk' indicate two major process, the first one is 'Listen' and the second part is 'Talk'. The meaning of 'Talk' is obvious. It means 'Transmit Data'. The tricky part is 'what does it exactly mean by 'Listen''. In more technical definition, 'Listen' mean 'perform CCA(Clear Channel Assessment)'. You can find a more detailed description on LBT in IEEE P802.19-08/0034r0 (The specific value (i.e, transmission time, threshold value may vary depending on application, but I think this explains overal LBT mechanism in easier way than other documents).\n\nCSAT : CSAT stands for Carrier Sensing Adaptive Transmission. CSAT is very similar to CSMA or LBT(Listen Before Talk), the main difference is that CSAT monitors(senses) the medium for much longer duration (around tens of msec to 200 msec) comparing to normal WiFi CSMA, so that it would not interfere not only with WiFi\ndata transmission (QoS traffic) but also with more sporadic transmission like discovery signals (Ref [2]). Unlike other techiques described in this section (defined with focus on 802.11 technology), CSAT is defined by LTE-U Forum with focus on 3GPP technology.\n\nIn LTE, every transmission within a specified spectrum is well managed/scheduled both for downlink and uplink. So Network can figure out exactly when to transmit something and when UE will transmit something.. but in Unlicensed band transmission and reception by the existing WiFi device is not as predictable as in LTE. Basically anybody can transmit in anytime as long as it complies with\nCSMA/CA procedure.\n\nIn this kind of situation, how LTE network can schedule transmission in Unlicensed band ?\n\nOne method is for LTE cell to perform a special channel selection procedure and allocate the channel only when it is clean. \nIn channel selection process, network measures the energy level within the allowed band and use those area in which the energy level is under a certain threshold (e.g, -62 dBm over 20 Mhz BW).\n\nThe Cell performs this kind of channel selection algorithm in on-going mode and if needed it will select more suitable channel and switch to it.\n\nWhat if you (a Cell) fail to find any clean channel at the initial channel selection process ?\n\nIn this case, the cell use another mechanism called CSAT (Carrier-Sensing Adaptive Transmission). Technically, CSAT is very similar to CSMA or LBT(Listen Before Talk), the main difference is that CSAT monitors(senses) the medium for much longer duration (around tens of msec to 200 msec) comparing to normal WiFi CSMA, so that it would not interfere not only with WiFi\ndata transmission (QoS traffic) but also with more sporadic transmission like discovery signals (Ref [2]).\n\nAccording to Reference [5], there seems to be roughly three levels of Coexistence strategy regarding LTE-U. Most of these techniques are already mentioned in previous section, but let me rewrite in a little bit different words.\n\nChannel Selection : This says \"Use WiFi band only when it is not being used (i.e, the band is clean)\". To figure out whether it is being used or not, you have to measure the engergy level of the target band as described above.\n\nTime-domain coexistence techniques : Even when it fail to find any clean channel in channel selection stage, there is still some chance. Even though there is no clean channel at the point of channel selection, there might be some empty slots if you look at the time domain scheduling with relatively high granularity.\nTo find out this kind of time domain opportunity and in order not to make an interference at any time, they are considering several different technology like CSAT, eCSAT, LBT. My personal question were 'do we have to support all these technology everywhere (every devices)?'. This question was answered by Reference [5] as follows.\n\nFor non listen-before-talk (LBT) markets such as the US, South Korea, China and India, CSAT (Carrier Sensing Adaptive Transmission) can be used without changing Rel-10 Carrier Aggregation protocols for co-channel coexistence. For LBT markets such as Europe and Japan, Rel-13 LAA will enable channel sharing with Wi-Fi by performing clear channel assessment (CCA) based channel availability sensing and adapting the transmission duration on a fine timescale, ranging from 1ms-10ms\n\nOpportunistic SCell operation : To me, this sounds like a rule (not a technology). Basically this says \"Use the unlicensed band only when it is really necessary (e.g, in real demand on high throughput or when the primary cell is overloaded). Release the unlicensenced and fall back to anchor carrier when\nthe demand for unlicenced band is not critical.\n\nInterplay of these coexistance technical components are well illustrated as follows in Ref [2].\n\nLTE-U stands for LTE-Unlicensed. This is the first real implementation of the whole LTE-Unlicensed family as far as I remember. Since this is already implemented and tested relatively widely and a lot of details are known, I thought I got enough information to write this subject in a separate page. Refer to LTE-U page for the details.\n\nIn other LTE-Unlincensed technology, LTE borrow only radio spectrum from WLAN and all the transmission/reception technology except radio spectrum purely based on LTE. However, in LWA LTE borrows not only WLAN radio spectrum but also WLAN Access Point for transmitting data. This key difference is illustrated as below. To implement this key difference, we would need to implement many other\ntechnical components. The most important part would be to implmenet special interface between LTE eNB and WLAN AP. Then you may ask.. at which layer the eNB and WLAN will be connected ? It would be quicker to interact if they can get connected at lower layer (e.g, PHY/MAC), but LTE PHY/MAC and WLAN PHY/MAC is completely different.. so hard to make any connection at this layer. So they will use higher layer (specifically PDCP) for this connection. As you know, there is no PDCP layer in WLAN. So connecting at PDCP\nlayer might be a little bit misleading. More accruately speaking, LTE PDCP packet will be encapsulated into WLAN MAC frame.\n\nNow LWA is defined in 3GPP specification and I created a separate page for 3GPP LWA because it will be a long story. Refer to LWA page for the 3GPP details.\n\nAround the end of 2016, I start hearing of implementing this both on UE modem and Network, UE testing equipment side. Now (as of early 2017) I am hearing of testing this feature on real UE. So I decided to create separate page for this. Read LAA page for the details.\n\nPutting very simple way, Multipath Aggregation (more formally Multipath TCP Aggregation : mptcp) is LTE-WLAN aggregation at TCP level as illustrated below. The key component in this architecture would be MP Proxy (Multipath Proxy) and this part is being defined in IETF (Ref [12] )\n\nAs of now (Jan 2015), I don't have any specific information other than Integrated wireless railway network to be commercialized .\n\n[1] LTE-U/LAA, MuLTEfire and Wi-Fi; making best use of unlicensed spectrum (Qualcomm)\n\n[9] Cracking Google Project Fi & LTE/Wi-Fi Aggregation with Qualcomm - Wi-Fi Now Episode 5 (YouTube)\n\n[10] The LTE-U vs. Wi-Fi debate continues empowering carriers with seamless Wi-Fi - Wi-Fi Now Episode 15 (YouYube)\n\n[15] ETSI EN 300 328 Wideband transmission systems;Data transmission equipment operating in the 2,4 GHz ISM band and using wide band modulation techniques;",

The split of control plane and user plane via E1 interface enhances the split between gNB-CU (gNB central unit) and gNB-DU (gNB distributed unit) defined within the NR WI. It offers the possibility of:\n\n(1) optimizing the location of different RAN functions based on the deployment scenario, (2) support efficient radio resource isolation for network slicing, (3) independent scaling of CP and UP capacity.\n\nIn the NR WI, a split of the gNB into a gNB-CU and a gNB-DU is defined. The gNB-CU hosts the RRC, SDAP and PDCP radio protocols, while the gNB-DU hosts the PHY, MAC and RLC radio protocols. The gNB-CU and the gNB-DU are connected via the F1 interface. This WI complements the split defined in the NR WI by enabling to split the gNB-CU into a gNB-CU-CP and a gNB-CU-UP. The gNB-CU-CP hosts the RRC and the instance of the PDCP protocol serving the control plane, while the gNB-CU-UP hosts the SDAP and the instance of the PDCP protocol serving the user plane. The gNB-CU-CP and the gNB-CU-UP are connected via the E1 interface. The gNB-CU-CP is connected to the gNB-DU via the control plane part of the F1 interface (F1-C), while the gNB-CU-UP is connected to the gNB-DU via the user plane part of the F1 interface (F1-U). The resulting gNB architecture inclusive of both the CU-DU split and the CP-UP split, is illustrated in Figure 12.1-1.\n\nThe architecture shown in Figure 1 enables the following deployment scenarios [2]:\n\nThe call-flows showing the most relevant procedures involving the E1 interface (e.g., initial UE attach, handover, bearer context setup and release) are captured in TS 38.401 [3]. The E1 functions and procedures are described in TS 38.460 [4]. The E1 physical layer and the signalling transport, which is based on the SCTP/IP protocol stack, are described respectively in TS 38.461 [5] and TS 38.462 [6]. The E1 application protocol (E1AP) is specified in TS 38.463 [7] and includes the description of: (1) the E1 interface management procedures, which allow to setup the E1 interface and to exchange the relevant configuration data between a gNB-CU-CP and a gNB-CU-UP; (2) the bearer context management procedures, which allow to setup and configure user plane resources to serve UEs.\n\nReferences\n\n12.1.2\tManagement Enhancement for EPC Control and User Plane Separation (CUPS)\n\nSummary based on the input provided by Huawei in SP-190029.\n\nThis work item specified management enhancements to support EPC CUPS, including performance measurements related to split S/P-GW architecture in TS 32.426, EPC Network Resource Model (NRM) Integration Reference Point (IRP) Information Service (IS) and Solution Set (SS) modifications in TS 28.708 and TS 28.709.\n\nThis work item implemented the conclusion of the study on Management Enhancement of CUPS of EPC Nodes (FS_MECUPS).

Does it mean 'emergency' ? or 'electronic' ? or something else ?\n\nEven though I haven't seen any formal documents that explicitely defines the letter 'e' in eCall, I think it would not be wrong if you say the 'e' mean 'emergency', i.e, 'eCall' would mean 'emergency Call'. But this interpretation would confuse a lot of people. Then, how does eCall differ from what we normally call 'Emergency Call (like 911)' ?\n\nI will explain on the details of this difference later, but simply put, the biggest difference would be the usual 'Emergency call' is a kind of voice call between a human and Emergency Call Center (usually another person in Emergency Call Center)' but 'eCall' is a call between a machine (called IVS : In Vehicle System within an automobile) and Emergency Center;.\n\nFor the persons who likes formal definition, I would quote some descriptions from a couple of international standards as follows :\n\neCall is a manually or automatically initiated emergency call, (TS12 : teleServiceCode 12) from a vehicle, supplemented with a minimum set of emergency related data (MSD), as defined under the EU Commission's eSafety initiative\n\neCall provides reliable full-duplex data communications between IVS and PSAP in addition to emergency voice call (E112) via the cellular network, and can be initiated either automatically or manually. The eCall In-band Modem uses the same voice channel as used for the emergency voice call. eCall allows reliable transmission of MSD alternating with a speech conversation through the existing voice communication paths in cellular mobile phone systems. The expected benefit is that emergency services will be made aware of accidents much more rapidly, will get precise information on location, vehicle type etc. and therefore will be able to reach accident victims faster, with the potential to save many lives annually.\n\nBefore we talk of the technical details of eCall, let's take a 10000-feet overview (high level view) on how eCall go through. You may find a lot of illustrations, cartoons on eCall from internet and following is my own version of illustration. I put the number labels on each of the steps and I would put a short descriptions on what's happening at each step.\n\n(2) eCall is triggered. eCall can be triggered in many ways. It can be triggered automatically by Air Bag or internal sensors. Or a person (e.g, driver) in the car can push the emergency button in the car to trigger the eCall.\n\n(3) The eCall device installed in the car (called IVS : In-Vehicle System) go through Emergency Voice Call setup process to establish the voice call channel. Once the voice call channel is established, the IVS send eCall Data (MSD : Minimal Set of Data) to PSAP (Public Safety Answering Point)\n\n(4) Once the eCall Data(MSD) is received by PSAP, the information would show up automatically on the screen at PSAP center.\n\n(5) The personnel at PSAP center may try voice contact to the person in the car if possible. But there would be many cases where this is not possible when person in the car is injured badly.\n\nFor those who came from Cellular protocol and new to eCall, it would be a little confusing on figuring out the difference between eCall and another type of Emergency Call (like 911 in North America) which we are familiar with in daily life. For those people, I think it would be easier / clearer to explain the difference in terms of overall protocol sequence. Following is my understanding (the image formed in my brain when I first got trained about this).\n\nAs you see here in the following illustration, there is common portions and different portions between eCall and Emergency Call.\n\nNOTE : IVS stands for In-Vehicle System. It is the eCall / Cellular module that are installed within Car (within Telematics module in most case). In terms of testing, this is a DUT\n\neCall Higher Layer Application Protocol (HLAP) is very simple (at least comparting to Cellular Protocol). Actually there is only one critical data to be transferred. The critical data is called MSD(Minimal Set of Data). All the remaining part is just to get MSD delivered to PSAP (Emergency Call Center) with reliability.\n\nAs in Cellular Voice Call, in HLAP there are two different type of call mode depending on who (IVS or PSAP) initiates call. The eCall initiated by IVS is called 'PUSH mode' and this is similar concept as MO(Mobile Originating) call in cellular voice call.\n\nThe eCall initiated by PSAP is called 'PULL mode' and this is similar concept as MT(Mobile Terminating) call in cellular voice call.\n\nThe two illustrations in this section is based on ETSI 103.428 Figure 2. The ETSI diagram is a single diagram showing both PUSH and PULL mode in single sequence. It looked a little confusing to me, so I split the digram into two separate diagram as shown below.\n\nNOTE 1 : IVS stands for In-Vehicle System. It is the eCall / Cellular module that are installed within Car (within Telematics module in most case). In terms of testing, this is a DUT\n\nNOTE 2 : PSAP stands for Public Safety Answering Point. This is a kind of Emergency Call Center.\n\nPSAP PUSH Mode Call is like MO call in celluar terminology. This is the call initiated by IVS (the mobile unit installed inside the car). I think in most case of eCall, the eCall goes in PUSH mode as illustrated below.\n\nPSAP PUSH Mode Call is like MT call in celluar terminology. This is the call initiated by PSAP (the call center). If you compare this with PUSH mode sequence, you would notice that most of the part are same. The only difference is the SEND-MSD (START) signal before the Initiation signal. This is also very much like cellular protocol. If you compare the MO Call and MT Call sequence in cellular protocol, you would notice that most part of the two are almost same. The main difference is that in MT Call the cellular network send 'Paging' (a kind of trigger for UE to initiate the call).\n\nAnother sequence that illustrate the eCall process with a little low layer point of view (especially in terms of LL/HL ACK operation) is shown below. This applies to both PUSH and PULL model.\n\n< ETSI TR 126.969 - Figure 1: Timeline of eCall with IVS initiated signalling and HL-ACK in normal operation >\n\nThere are various timers in eCall protocol which should be met in order to guarantee the normal functionality of the eCall. Some of these timers are an important criterial of testing eCall functionality.\n\nAs mentioned above, the only one fundamental goal for eCall is to deliver MSD(Minimal Set of Data) with reliability. Then you may ask what kind of information is in the MSD. High level description of the imformation in MSD can be find from following description. As you see, the most important information in the MSD is the location data and vehicle information.\n\nThe eCall modem allows to transfer a data message from the IVS over the cellular network to the PSAP which is denoted as eCall MSD. The MSD can include, e.g. vehicle location information, time stamp, number of passengers, Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), and other relevant accident information\n\nThe Minimum Set of Data forming the data component of an eCall sent from a vehicle to a Public Safety Answering Point or other designated emergency call centre. The MSD has a maximum size of 140 bytes and includes, for example, vehicle identity, location information and time-stamp.\n\nBefore we think of this, let's think of why we need to care of this. We should care of this because eCall signaling message and data are delivered in the form of Voice call data of GSM or WCDMA cellular network.\n\nIn GSM / WCDMA, various different types of codecs are used. Basically the codec selection is a job for the specific Radio Access Network equipment(RAN Equipment) that is communicating with the eCall device. The RAN Equipment (Network) would select the codec that would give the best performance in a specific situation. 'Performance' mean 'How fast the eCall data can be delivered' and 'How reliably it can be delivered under a specific channel condition'. It would be too much (or too boring) to present the full details on these performance here. If you are really interested in the details, refer to ETSI TR 126.969 and it would give you a lot of test data for various different Codecs.\n\nIn theory, you can use a live network and PSAP Simulator to test your eCall Device (IVS). But theory is just a theory. You would come across a lot of issues to overcome if you go for this option even though I cannot say it is impossible.\n\nAnother way of testing the eCall device is to construct test setup as described in ETSI 103.428 section 6 Test Configurations. In this document, it is described to use a private cellular network for various Interoperability and Conformance Testing.\n\nThe most practical solution (Test setup) that will be used in the industry would be to use Cellular Network Simulator and PSAP simulator as illustrated below.\n\nAssuming that you have a test setup and you need to determine what to test. As in most of other wireless and cellular device device, you may think of general test that tend to happen during the development or system integration stage. We often call these test in various different name such as function test, integration test or smoke test etc. Usually test specification / procedure tend not to be clearly defined or the procedure changes often depending on situations. Also those test procedure / test item may vary depending on manufacturer. Therefore, it would not be easy to clearly define on what to test for this stage. However, if you just take a close look at the overall eCall protocol, you would easily guess high level test items even without looking into any specification. My personal version of the guess work about the first level test are shown below. You may come up with different idea, but I don't think there would be any big difference between your idea and my idea.\n\nOnce you complete the general function test during development and system integration level and have a stable device, you would forward the device to conformance test. Once you are at the stage of conformance test, you don't have to worry about what to test because a lot of other people (standard body) put a lot of effort and energy and came out with well defined document. In 3GPP/ETSI, those test procedures are defined in ETSI TS 103.428.\n\nAfter completing the conformance, if you are trying to sell the device (acutually Automakers trying to sell cars) in a specific region (e.g, Europe, Asia, America etc), you may need to go through a specific set of test cases specified by the regulatory body in that specific region.\n\nFollowings are the examples of how eCall is being testing during the development or for conformance test before commercialization.\n\nFollowings are the list of the specifications for eCall. I think the most fundamental specifications are CEN documents. But it is not free to get those spec. Recently 3GPP / ETSI has released various specifications. I think most part of the 3GPP specification are based on CEN specification.\n\n: Describes mostly on physical/transport layer design and process of transmitter and reciever.\n\n: This documents describes on API and parameter descriptions of eCall modem protocol stack. It describes on overall software architecture and API prototype but not show the function body. Unless you are developing the protocol stack, you would not need to read this spec.\n\n: This documents describes general logics on eCall Test, but it does not specifies any specific test cases or details of protocol sequence. If you are interested in physical / transport layer level testing, this document would help you to catch the overall test concept.\n\n: If you are interested in high level protocol and function test, this document would help a lot. It shows overall protocol sequence of eCall and decfines specific test sequences. Most of the test in this document (as of V1.1.1 (2016-06)) are based on CEN EN 16062:2015\n\nRoad transport and traffic telematics eSafety eCall minimum set of data - Draft EN 081018\n\nIntelligent transport systems eSafety - Pan European eCall - Operating requirements",

SUPL operations must take place in combination with control-plane procedures over NRPPa.\n\nThis situation could arise in the case of UE-assisted OTDOA, for example, in which the SLP needs to provide the UE (in a SUPL session) with assistance data supplied by the NG-RAN. This clause uses a UE-assisted OTDOA positioning operation as an example.\n\nAlthough the positioning server in this operation is the SLP, the existence of an interface to the LMF means that the SLP can communicate with the LMF via the SPC. In particular, this means that assistance data that was delivered to the LMF via NRPPa can be transferred over to the SLP for delivery to the UE via LPP over SUPL.\n\nThere are several ways to realise this general behaviour. In the simplest case, the LMF could be supplied with the necessary assistance data in advance, so that it can be supplied to the SLP without any actual NRPPa procedures taking place in real time (and possibly even before the positioning transaction begins).\n\nIn the event that the LMF does not have the required assistance data available, it would need to retrieve them from the NG-RAN once it was made aware that they were needed.\n\nIn both cases, it should be noted that the retrieval of the assistance data is transparent to the UE and to the actual SUPL session. This model is parallel to the approach used with A-GNSS, in which assistance data such as satellite ephemerides are retrieved from sources entirely external to the cellular network. For purposes of LPP over SUPL, the delivery of assistance data to the SLP can be viewed as an independent external process.\n\nThe delivery of assistance data to the UE, however, takes place through the same mechanisms as control-plane LPP, transported through SUPL.\n\nAnnex B (informative):\nChange history",

The downlink DPCH can thus be seen as a time multiplex of a downlink DPDCH and a downlink DPCCH, compare subclause 5.2.1.\n\nFigure 9 shows the frame structure of the downlink DPCH. Each frame of length 10 ms is split into 15 slots, each of length Tslot = 2560 chips, corresponding to one power-control period.\n\nThe parameter k in figure 9 determines the total number of bits per downlink DPCH slot. It is related to the spreading factor SF of the physical channel as SF = 512/2k. The spreading factor may thus range from 512 down to 4.\n\nThe exact number of bits of the different downlink DPCH fields (Npilot, NTPC, NTFCI, Ndata1 and Ndata2) is given in table 11. What slot format to use is configured by higher layers and can also be reconfigured by higher layers.\n\nThere are basically two types of downlink Dedicated Physical Channels; those that include TFCI (e.g. for several simultaneous services) and those that do not include TFCI (e.g. for fixed-rate services). These types are reflected by the duplicated rows of table 11. It is the UTRAN that determines if a TFCI should be transmitted and it is mandatory for all UEs to support the use of TFCI in the downlink. The mapping of TFCI bits onto slots is described in [3].\n\nIn compressed frames, a different slot format is used compared to normal mode. There are two possible compressed slot formats that are labelled A and B. Slot format B shall be used in frames compressed by spreading factor reduction and slot format A shall be used in frames compressed by higher layer scheduling. The channel bit and symbol rates given in table 11 are the rates immediately before spreading.\n\nThe pilot bit patterns are described in table 12. The shadowed column part of pilot bit pattern is defined as FSW and FSWs can be used to confirm frame synchronization. (The value of the pilot bit pattern other than FSWs shall be \"11\".) In table 12, the transmission order is from left to right.\n\nIn downlink compressed mode through spreading factor reduction, the number of bits in the TPC and Pilot fields are doubled. Symbol repetition is used to fill up the fields. Denote the bits in one of these fields in normal mode by x1, x2, x3, …, xX. In compressed mode the following bit sequence is sent in corresponding field: x1, x2, x1, x2, x3, x4, x3, x4,…, xX,.\n\nThe relationship between the TPC symbol and the transmitter power control command is presented in table 13.\n\nMulticode transmission may be employed in the downlink, i.e. the CCTrCH (see [3]) is mapped onto several parallel downlink DPCHs using the same spreading factor. In this case, the Layer 1 control information is transmitted only on the first downlink DPCH. DTX bits are transmitted during the corresponding time period for the additional downlink DPCHs, see figure 10.\n\nIn case there are several CCTrCHs mapped to different DPCHs transmitted to the same UE different spreading factors can be used on DPCHs to which different CCTrCHs are mapped. Also in this case, Layer 1 control information is only transmitted on the first DPCH while DTX bits are transmitted during the corresponding time period for the additional DPCHs.",

A location area is an area in which, after having performed a location update once, MSs may roam without being required to perform subsequent location updates for reason of location change. A location area consists of one or more cells.\n\nFor further details of the network architecture, see 3GPP TS 23.002.\n2.3\tLocation area identification\nThe Location Area Identification (LAI) plan is part of the base station identification plan. The base stations are identified uniquely (see 3GPP TS 23.003).\n2.4\tIMSI detach/attach operation\nThe support of IMSI detach/attach operation is mandatory in MSs. The facility is optional in the fixed infrastructure of the PLMN.\n2.4.1\tExplicit IMSI detach/attach\nExplicit IMSI detach operation is the action taken by an MS to indicate to the PLMN that the station has entered an inactive state (e.g. the station is powered down). Explicit IMSI attach operation is the action taken by an MS to indicate that the station has re-entered an active state (e.g. the station is powered up).\n2.4.2\tImplicit IMSI detach\n\nImplicit IMSI detach operation is the action taken by the VLR to mark an MS as detached when there has been no successful contact between the MS and the network for a time determined by the implicit detach timer. The value of the implicit detach timer is derived from the periodic location updating timer; when the MSC/VLR applies Mobility Management Congestion Control to a MS, the MSC/VLR may need to adjust the Implicit Detach timer as specified in clause 3.7.2. During an established radio contact, the implicit detach timer shall be prevented from triggering implicit detach. At the release of the radio connection, the implicit detach timer shall be reset and restarted. Implicit IMSI detach shall also be performed in the case of a negative response to an IMEI check.\n2.5\tUse of the term mobile station (MS) in the present document\n\nIn order to simplify the text the term Mobile Station (MS) as used in relation to location management refers to the entity where the IMSI is stored, i.e., in card operated MSs the term Mobile Station (MS) refers to the card.\n2.6\tPaging area\nAs an option, and for paging optimization purpose, the VLR may control Paging Areas. A Paging Area (PgA) is composed of up to 5 Location Areas, and the MSC area is composed of several Paging Areas. Paging areas may overlap each other. The Paging Area is stored in the HLR and updated at each paging area change. The Paging Area is sent by the HLR to the VLR at roaming number request and may be used by the MSC/VLR for paging (e.g. when LAI is not known, after MSC/VLR restart) (see 3GPP TS 23.018 [5a]).",

There may be zero, one, or several uplink DPDCHs on each radio link.\n\nThe uplink DPCCH is used to carry control information generated at Layer 1. The Layer 1 control information consists of known pilot bits to support channel estimation for coherent detection, transmit power-control (TPC) commands, feedback information (FBI), and an optional transport-format combination indicator (TFCI). The transport-format combination indicator informs the receiver about the instantaneous transport format combination of the transport channels mapped to the simultaneously transmitted uplink DPDCH radio frame. There is one and only one uplink DPCCH on each radio link. The uplink DPCCH may also carry DL FET ACK/NACK signalling information for DL FET operation when DL_DCH_FET_Config = 1.\n\nThe uplink DPCCH2 is used to carry control information generated at Layer 1. The Layer 1 control information consists of known pilot bits to support channel estimation for coherent detection, and transmit power-control (TPC) commands. When DPCCH2 is configured there is one and only one uplink DPCCH2 for all radio links. When DPCCH2 is configured, the UE shall transmit DPCCH2 only in the slots in which DPCCH is transmitted.\n\nThe uplink S-DPCCH is used to carry control information generated at Layer 1. The Layer 1 control information consists of known pilot bits to support channel sounding and channel estimation for coherent detection. There is up to one uplink S-DPCCH on each radio link in the case that UL_CLTD_Enabled as defined in [5] is TRUE. Figure 1 shows the frame structure of the uplink DPDCH, the uplink DPCCH, the uplink DPCCH2 and the uplink S-DPCCH. Each radio frame of length 10 ms is split into 5 subframes, each of 3 slots, each of length Tslot = 2560 chips, corresponding to one power-control period. The DPDCH, DPCCH, S-DPCCH and DPCCH2 are always frame aligned with each other.\n\nThe parameter k in figure 1 determines the number of bits per uplink DPDCH slot. It is related to the spreading factor SF of the DPDCH as SF = 256/2k. The DPDCH spreading factor may range from 256 down to 4. The spreading factor of the uplink DPCCH, the uplink DPCCH2 and the uplink S-DPCCH is always equal to 256, i.e. there are 10 bits per uplink DPCCH/S-DPCCH/DPCCH2 slot.\n\nThe exact number of bits of the uplink DPDCH and the different uplink DPCCH fields (Npilot, NTFCI, NFBI, and NTPC) is given by table 1 and table 2. What slot format to use is configured by higher layers and can also be reconfigured by higher layers. The exact number of bits of the uplink S-DPCCH is given by table 2A.\n\nThe uplink DPCCH2 reuses slot format #1 of DPCCH, and the exact number of bits is given in table 2.\n\nThe channel bit and symbol rates given in table 1, table 2 and table 2A are the rates immediately before spreading. The pilot patterns are given in table 3 and table 4, the TPC bit pattern is given in table 5.\n\nThe FBI bits are used to support techniques requiring feedback from the UE to the UTRAN Access Point for operation of closed loop mode transmit diversity. The use of the FBI bits is described in detail in [5].\n\nThere are two types of uplink dedicated physical channels; those that include TFCI (e.g. for several simultaneous services) and those that do not include TFCI (e.g. for fixed-rate services). These types are reflected by the duplicated rows of table 2. It is the UTRAN that determines if a TFCI should be transmitted and it is mandatory for all UEs to support the use of TFCI in the uplink. The mapping of TFCI bits onto slots is described in [3].\n\nDPCCH slot format 5 is used when DL_DCH_FET_Config is configured by higher layers. In this case, over a 20ms Compression Interval (CI) consisting of 30 slots, the bits in the TFCI field carry TFCI information in the first 10 slots, and may carry an ACK/NACK indicator for DL FET in the remaining 20 slots. The ACK/NACK for DL FET is sent when DL_DCH_FET_Config = 1.\n\nIn compressed mode, DPCCH slot formats with TFCI fields are changed. There are two possible compressed slot formats for normal slot formats 0 and 2. They are labelled A and B and the selection between them is dependent on the number of slots that are transmitted in each frame in compressed mode. When DL_DCH_FET_Config is configured by higher layers, UL DPCCH slot format 5 is used in compressed mode. In compressed mode when UL_DCH_FET_Config is configured by higher layers, TFCI bits represent TFCI information in the first 10 slots that are not in compressed-mode gaps in a 20ms CI. The TFCI bits in subsequent slots that are not in the compressed mode gaps represent ACK/NACK indication for DL FET when DL_DCH_FET_Config = 1.\n\nIf UL_DTX_Active is TRUE (see [5]), the number of transmitted slots per radio frame may be less than the number shown in Table 2 and Table 2A.\n\nThe pilot bit pattern for S-DPCCH is the same as that for uplink DPCCH with Npilot = 8. The Nfixed bits in the S-DPCCH are fixed to \"10\".\n\nThe pilot bit pattern for DPCCH2 is the same as that for uplink DPCCH with Npilot = 8.\n\nThe pilot bit patterns are described in table 3 and table 4. The shadowed column part of pilot bit pattern is defined as FSW and FSWs can be used to confirm frame synchronization. (The value of the pilot bit pattern other than FSWs shall be \"1\".)\n\nThe relationship between the TPC bit pattern and transmitter power control command is presented in table 5.\n\nMulti-code operation is possible for the uplink dedicated physical channels. When multi-code transmission is used, several parallel DPDCH are transmitted using different channelization codes, see [4]. However, there is only one DPCCH per radio link, one DPCCH2 if DPCCH2 is configured and up to one S-DPCCH in the case that UL_CLTD_Enable is TRUE.\n\nA period of uplink DPCCH transmission prior to the start of the uplink DPDCH transmission (uplink DPCCH power control preamble) shall be used for initialisation of a DCH. The length of the power control preamble is a higher layer parameter, Npcp , signalled by the network [5]. The UL DPCCH shall take the same slot format in the power control preamble as afterwards, as given in table 2. When Npcp > 0 the pilot patterns of table 3 and table 4 shall be used. The timing of the power control preamble is described in [5], subclause 4.3.2.3. The TFCI field is filled with \"0\" bits.",

A slot transmission is simply a shortening of the current subframe transmission in half, while a subslot transmission consist of either a 2-symbol or a 3-symbol transmission duration.\n\nThe subslot division in a subframe is fixed in the UL while it varies depending on the first potential symbol for PDSCH in the DL, as shown in Figure 13.8-2. Each subframe is divided into up to 6 subslots. Subslot operation is not defined for lDataStart=4.\n\nThe slot operation is defined for both FS1 and FS2, while subslot operation is only defined for FS1. FS3 is not supported.\n\nThe combinations of slot and subslot operation on DL and UL are shown in Table 1. The asymmetric operation of subslot in DL and slot in UL is primarily allowed to improve coverage for the UL control channel.\n\nIn a carrier aggregation setting, an sTTI DL/UL combination is configured per component carrier (CC). A CA PUCCH group should have the same UL/DL sTTI configuration for the sTTI-configured SCells and the cell carrying PUCCH. However Different DL/UL sTTI lengths can be configured for the serving cells across different PUCCH groups. sTTI operation can also be configured in a DL only Scell. The maximum number of supported UL and DL sTTI carriers is the same as in 1 ms TTI operation. Cross-carrier scheduling is not supported for sTTI.\n\nThe physical channels for subslot and slot operation are given in Table 13.8-3.\n\nAs can be seen, although the transmission duration of the data channels (PDSCH/PUSCH) also follows the slot and subslot transmission duration, they are not defined as new physical channels. Except for some changes on the transport block size (TBS), resource allocation scheme and DL/UL UE-specific reference signal pattern, the main characteristics of the 1 ms data channels have been maintained. Both UL and DL control channels, on the other hand, have been significantly re-designed motivating to treat them as separate physical channels in the specification. SPUCCH follows subslot and slot duration (including also SR with a periodicity down to 1 subslot), while SPDCCH has either 1 os, 2 os or 3 os duration, transmitted at the start of each subslot/slot, and may span only configured frequency resources as illustrated in Figure 13.8-3.\n\nA fallback mode to 1 ms transmission is also supported for subslot and slot operation, the fallback is dynamic and can occur on a subframe to subframe basis. The UE needs to monitor both 1 ms and subslot/slot based control. Collision handling in case of simultaneous subslot/slot and subframe transmission in UL on the same CC has been specified to ensure a consistent UE behaviour.\n\nBoth CRS-based and DMRS-based demodulation is supported for SPDCCH and in case of CRS-based SPDCCH, the mapping of the SPDCCH can be configured to be either over 1 or 2 symbols in time (1 symbol illustrated above in Figure 3). In case of DMRS-based SPDCCH, the control is always mapped over 2 symbols for slot-based SPDCCH, while for subslot it aligns with the subslot duration (2 or 3 symbols).\n\nTo efficiently make use of the control resources not used in a subslot/slot, a re-use mechanism is specified to re-use the control region for data, illustrated in Figure 4. Both a semi-static and dynamic mechanism is specified. The efficiency of the re-use depends on the configuration (ideal re-use assumed in Figure 13.8-4).\n\nTo further minimize overhead, the DL DMRS can be shared between two consecutive subslots within a slot . The presence of the DL DMRS for PDSCH in subslot operation is indicated in the DL DCI (present or not). In UL the DMRS can be shared between all three subslots of a slot. The UL DMRS presence and position is indicated in the UL DCI. A possible configuration of the UL DMRS in a subframe that minimizes DMRS overhead is illustrated in Figure 13.8-5.\n\nThe specification also allows for DMRSs symbols to be shared between UEs in the UL, also referred to as DMRS multiplexing. In this case, an IFDMA based DMRS is typically used which allows users of different resource allocation to share the DMRS symbol by the use of different IFDMA combs, maintaining orthogonality between UEs.\n\nAs with short processing time for 1 ms, subslot/slot transmissions are associated with asynchronous HARQ operation on the UL. The processing time compared to regular 1 ms operation and the maximum timing advance are also reduced for both slot and subslot operation. In case of subslot operation, the UE can in its capability indicate the support of different processing timeline sets with associated maximum timing advance depending on the DL control channel configuration (DMRS-based SPDCCH, 1os CRS-based SPDCCH or 2os CRS-based SPDCCH). The processing timelines and associated maximum timing advance is summarized in Table 13.8-4. As can be seen, for each processing timeline set, there are two possible processing timelines (for example n+4 and n+6 for Set 1). Which one to use is under network control and configured by RRC (depending on the timing advance assigned to the UE).\n\nThe number of HARQ processes has been increased to 16 for slot/subslot operation and the HARQ processes can be shared between subslot/slot and 1 ms operation (with the restriction that the TBS and number of codewords limitations of subslot/slot need to be respected in case of initial transmission on 1 ms with a later retransmission on subslot/slot).\n\nA new set of DCI formats, named DCI format 7.x is associated with sTTI for slot and subslots scheduling. Among the specific features of these DCI formats, resource allocation has been modified to reflect the shorter TTI and therefore the granularity in RB allocation is increased.\n\nAdditional functionality also specified in the feature is sTTI specific aperiodic CSI reporting which includes measuring on a slot/subslot CSI reference resource as well as faster triggering and faster processing time for the CSI to be reported. Periodic CSI reporting is not supported.\n\nAlso, semi-persistent scheduling is specified for sTTI with similar functionality as in legacy operation. A contention based SPS operation is allowed where different UEs can be assigned different cyclic shifts and IFDMA combs for the DMRS, but fully/partially overlapping resource allocation.\n\nReferences",

It is mainly for 5G Radio System. Even though no 3GPP specification about 5G is available, this project will contribute a lot in 5G community. Refer to OpenAirInterface home page for the details.\n\nOpenAirInterface (OAI) Software Alliance aims to further the software towards future 3GPP releases for 5G. The main goal of the alliance is to create an ecosystem of industrial/non-profit/academic organizations to implement reference solution for 3GPP standards. The OAI is striving to become a tool used by both the industry and academic for using community driven development to accelerate innovation in 5G wireless technologies, and to bring the huge economic success to this part of information technology. The OAI targets a reference implementation of Release 14 LTE based on the current 4G implementation and to progressively add enhancements from 3GPP study items defining the future 5G standard.\n\nOpenAirInterface is an open source implementation of 3GPP stack. It covers different parts of 3GPP stack (eNodeB, UE, MME, HSS, S-GW, P-GW). The software runs on general purpose computing platform (for ex. Intel/ARM) and interfaces with wide variety of SDR platforms (EXMIMO, USRP, BladeRF, LimeSDR).\n\nThe OAI currently implements Rel 8/10 stack for eNB/UE/EPC. It runs on standard Ubuntu Linux 14.04 LTS with low-latency kernel for eNB/UE. OAI requires Intel processors which support (SSE3/SSE4), however support for AVX2 is optional. It is also a requirement to have USB3/PCIe on a PC which interfaces with SDR platforms (USRP, BladeRF, EXMIMO and LimeSDR). The code compiles with standard GNU toolchain that comes with Linux. OAI can be also run in simulation mode (oaisim), the details of which are provided by Open Air Usage tutorials on the gitlab server@EURECOM.\n\nThe OAI software packages used to deploy an operators core network, the Enhanced Packet Core or EPC, are collectively known as openairCN while the access network software for base stations and terminals goes under the name of openair5G.\n\nThe EPC is quickly being integrated with other open source software packages providing telecommunication services and solutions for network management (e.g. openIMS, Clearwater IMS, OpenDayLight, Open Source MANO (OSM), OpNFV) on the generic cloud computing platform OpenStack. To ease integration with OpenStack software packages, and because revenues from the EPC are less dependent on intellectual property agreements, openairCN is distributed with a standard Apache V2.0 license, which is quite common in cloud computing software. The access network software openair5G, on the other hand, is freely distributed by the OAI under the terms stipulated by a new open source licence, the OAI Public License, catering to the intellectual property agreements used in 3GPP and allowing contributions from 3GPP members holding patents on key procedures used in the standard. The OAI is working closely with ETSI to harmonise the software licence with the intellectual property policy of 3GPP. The end result is that groups can use the software as any Apache V2.0 software for non-commercial purposes (e.g. for study and research) while for commercial exploitation of the community software, users are bound to respect intellectual property agreements associated with the 3GPP standard as with proprietary hardware and software. For details on OAI licensing model, please refer to OAI License Model page.\n\nSince, the evolution of 5G is still under discussion within academia/industry, we plan to identify different areas in which different members of the alliance create projects. The projects are created with the goal of furthering these strategic areas within the alliance and making sure the output of the project is merged back with the main repository at some point. The strategic areas of the alliance ratified by the board are listed here.\n\nIn order to install OAI successfully, it is important to follow HW/SW requirements. Almost all the technical documentation is hosted on EURECOM gitlab server. The entry point for wiki for openair5G is OAI Wiki/Home and the entry point for openairCN is OAI-CN Wiki/Home is here. There are several tutorials inside Gitlab page to run OAI in various modes (Emulation, Simulation, real-time with COTS UE, etc). The mailing lists for both user and developer community is OAI Wiki/Mailinglist. The gitlab workflow/coding guidelines/contributing guidelines are here.\n\nOAI hosts several training/workshops periodically for roadmap discussions with the community and also to train the community regarding the software implementation. For more information, refer to OAI Community/Workshop.\n\nThe Alliance offers several membership models for companies, non-profit institutions and individual contributors. The membership is free for individuals/non-profit organizations, however there is fee for corporations. For more info regarding membership, refer to OSA/JoinUs.\n\nQ2. Is there any operating system requirement ? (What type of linux ? what version ? etc) What is Operating System details that has been verified by OAI developers.\n\nQ4. What kind of hardware can be used to run OAI and what are those which has been verified by OAI developer ?\n\nQ4-1. Would OAI be runnable on USRP Embedded Sieries ? (Any verification activity done ?)\n\n[Ans] Yes, but we have not tried it. OAI needs to be ported to ZynQ to run on USRP Embedded series.\n\nQ4-2.There are many different series of USRP. Is there any specific series/model that is not usable for OAI ? (In terms of performance etc)\n\n[Ans] It is not recommended to use USRP N series as it is not able to do LTE sampling rate (30.72 for 20 MHz). In order to use USRP N-series, LTE sampling rate needs to be implemented in software on a PC\n\nQ5. Is there any additional libraries or tools that are required to OAI stack ? (e.g, GNU Radio or FFTW etc)\n\n[Ans] There are additional libraries required but they are installed automatically by OAI scripts (Refer to OAI Autobuild for details).\n\nQ7. Is it possible to develop use OAI as software simulator without hardware ? (Like Matlab LTE toolbox)\n\n[Ans] Yes, it has a simulation mode called oaisim (Refer to OIA Wiki/OpenAirUsage for details).\n\n[Ans] 5 Mhz and 10 Mhz has been most extensively tested as of now (Apr 2016) and 20 MHz is close to being released as well, but theoretically it should work with all bands\n\nQ10. What is the maximum MCS and maximum RB that has been proved working (for 5Mhz, 10 Mhz BW) in OAI system ?",

    "context": "https://www.3gpp.org/technologies/keywords-acronyms/105-son\n\nSON\n\nSON solutions can be divided into three categories: Self-Configuration, Self-Optimisation and Self-Healing. The SON architecture can be a centralized, distributed or a hybrid solution.\n\nThis is the dynamic plug-and-play configuration of newly deployed eNBs. The eNB will by itself configure the Physical Cell Identity, transmission frequency and power, leading to faster cell planning and rollout.\n\nThe interfaces S1 and X2 are dynamically configured, as well as the IP address and connection to IP backhaul. To reduce manual work ANR (Automatic neighbour relations) is used. ANR configures the neighbouring list in newly deployed eNBs and is optimizing the list configuration during operation.\n\nDynamic configuration includes the configuration of the Layer 1 identifier, Physical cell identity (PCI) and Cell global ID (CGID). There are 504 different PCIs available in LTE, the PCI mapping shall fulfill the collision free condition as well as the confusion free. The PCI can be assigned either in a centralized or distributed way.\n\nWhen centralised assignment is used the OAM system will have a complete knowledge and control of the PCIs. When the distributed solution is used the OAM system assigns a list of possible PCIs to the newly deployed eNB, but the adoption of the PCI is in control of the eNB. The newly deployed eNB will request a report, sent either by User Equipment (UEs) over the air interface or by other eNBs over the X2 interface, including already in-use PCIs, see figure 1. - The eNB will randomly select its PCI from the remaining values.\n\nANR is used to minimize the work required for configuration in newly deployed eNBs as well as to optimize configuration during operation. Correct and up-to-date neighbouring lists will increase the number of successful handovers and minimize the number of dropped calls. Before a handover can be executed the source eNB requires the neighbouring information: PCI and CGID of the target eNB.\n\nThe PCI is included in every normal measurement report. The mapping between the PCI and CGID parameters can be done by using information from the OAM or reported by UEs decoding the target cell CGID on the broadcast channel in the target cell, see figure 2. The capability of decoding CGID is an optional UE feature.\n\nA network operator can put a cell on a ANR black list, to block certain handover candidates, for example from indoor to outdoor cells. 3GPP has also specified LTE Inter-Frequency and Inter-RAT (Radio Access Technology) ANR.\n\nFunctions for self-optimisation are mainly included in Release 9. It includes optimisation of coverage, capacity, handover and interference.\n\nMobility load balancing (MLB) is a function where cells suffering congestion can transfer load to other cells, which have spare resources. MLB includes load reporting between eNBs to exchange information about load level and available capacity.\n\nThe periodicity of the reporting can be requested in the range of 1 to 10 s. The report can contain, hardware load, S1 transport network load and Radio resource status. The Radio resource status reports are separated in Up Link and Down Link reports, including the total allocation guaranteed and non-guaranteed bit rate traffic, the percentage of allocated Physical Resource Block (PRB) and the percentage of PRBs available for load balancing.\n\nMLB can also be used between different Radio Technologies. In case of inter-RAT the load reporting RAN Information Management (RIM) protocol will be used to transfer the information via the core between the base stations of different radio technologies. A cell capacity class value, set by the OAM-system, will be used to compare and weigh the different technologies radio capacities against each other.\n\nA handover due to load balancing is carried out as a regular handover, but it may be necessary to amend parameters so that the User Equipment (UE) does not return to the congested cell. The amendment must take place in both cells, so that the handover settings remain coherent in both. The eNBs need to estimate how much the cell border needs to be shifted, expressed in dB, to avoid a quick return of the UE.\n\nMobility robustness optimization (MRO) is a solution for automatic detection and correction of errors in the mobility configuration. In Release 9 the focus is on errors causing Radio link failure (RLF) due to too late or early handover, or handover to an incorrect cell.\n\nIn case of late handover, see figure 3, the handover procedure in the source cell is initialized too late, since the UE is moving faster than the Handover (HO) parameter settings allow. Hence when the RRC HO command from the serving cell is transmitted the signal strength is too weak to reach the UE, now located in the target cell, connection is lost. The UE attempts a connection re-establishment, containing PCID and C-RNTI belonging to the source cell, but received by the target cell. The target eNB will then inform the source cell about RLF to adjust Handover parameters.\n\nIt is a bit more complicated to detect a too early handover, see figure 4. The UE has successfully been handed over from source cell A to target cell B, but since it was triggered too early the connection will drop almost immediately due to too poor radio conditions in the target cell B. The UE will then try to re-establish the connection, which will now take place in the original source cell, cell A, since this cell is the strongest one. The UE will use the PCID and RNTI from the target cell B and the source cell A will then consider this as a Radio Link Failure due to too late handover and send an indication to the target cell B. But the target cell B will now recognize the parameters in the indication, as given to a mobile that had just completed a handover to cell B from cell A now indicating failure. The target cell B will send back a report about too early Handover to adjust Handover parameters, to the source cell A.\n\nIn order to save energy some cells can be switched off when capacity is not needed. The power consumption in a base station is not only related to load, a number of functions requires power even if there are no users to serve. But, if a cell is switched off, in the legal operator license there are still requirements on coverage, the coverage must be maintained at all times! The suspension of the cell may occur when the last user leaves the cell, all incoming handovers during this period of time will then be rejected. The cells that remain on, providing coverage, can wake up a suspended cell when traffic load increase. This can be done with a wake-up call to the sleeping cell.\n\nRACH optimisation aims to minimise the number of attempts on the RACH channel, causing interference. The UE can be polled by the eNB for RACH statistics after connection. The number of preambles sent until successful RACH completion, and the number of contention resolution failure are in the statistics. But PRACH configuration parameters can also be distributed amongst eNBs, like zero correlation configuration, root sequence, high speed flag and PRACH frequency offset.\n\nFeatures for automatic detection and removal of failures and automatic adjustment of parameters are mainly specified in Release 10.\n\nCoverage and Capacity Optimization enables automatic correction of capacity problems depending on slowly changing environment, like seasonal variations.\n\nMinimization of drive tests (MDT), is enabling normal UEs to provide the same type of information as those collected in drive test. A great advantage is that UEs can retrieve and report parameters from indoor environments.",

The system consists of the major components TRAU and BTS on the network side and the MS. On the network side, speech encoder (SPE) and channel encoder (CHE) as well as channel decoder (CHD) and speech decoder (SPD) are connected via the serial A-bis interface. For each link, quality information is derived by estimating the current channel state. Based on the channel state,  and also taking into consideration possible constraints from network control, the codec mode control, which is located on the network side, selects the codec modes to be applied.\n\nThe channel mode to use (TCH/AFS, TCH/AHS, O-TCH/AHS, TCH/WFS, O-TCH/WFS or O-TCH/WHS) is controlled by the network. Uplink and downlink always apply the same channel mode.\n\nFor codec mode adaptation the receiving side performs link quality measurements of the incoming link. The measurements are processed yielding a Quality Indicator. For uplink adaptation, the Quality Indicator is directly fed into the UL mode control unit. This unit compares the Quality Indicator with certain thresholds and generates, also considering possible constraints from network control, a Codec Mode Command indicating the codec mode to be used on the uplink. The Codec Mode Command is then transmitted inband to the mobile side where the incoming speech signal is encoded in the corresponding codec mode. For downlink adaptation, the DL Mode Request Generator within the mobile compares the DL Quality indicator with certain thresholds and generates a Codec Mode Request indicating the preferred codec mode for the downlink. The Codec Mode Request is transmitted inband to the network side where it is fed into the DL Mode Control unit. This unit generally grants the requested mode. However, considering possible constraints from network control, it may also override the request. The resulting codec mode is then applied for encoding of the incoming speech signal in downlink direction. Both for uplink and downlink, the presently applied codec mode is transmitted inband as Codec Mode Indication together with the coded speech data. At the decoder, the Codec Mode Indication is decoded and applied for decoding of the received speech data.\n\nCodec mode selection is done from a set of codec modes (ACS, Active Codec Set), which may include 1 to 4 AMR codec modes. Associated with this set is a list of 1 to 3 switching thresholds and hysteresis used by the DL Mode Request Generator and the UL mode control unit to generate the Codec Mode Requests and Codec Mode Commands. These configuration parameters (ACS, thresholds, hysteresis) are defined at call set-up and can be modified at handover or during a call.\n\n3.1.2\tOperation with ongoing Tandem Free Operation\n\nIf tandem free operation is ongoing (see 3GPP TS 28.062) then the speech signal has to be transmitted over two radio links, first uplink (MS1 to BTS1)  and then downlink (BTS2 to MS2), respectively symmetrically in the reverse direction. The optimal Codec Mode in direction MS1 to MS2 shall be derived from the Codec Mode Command for the first uplink (CMC1, within BTS1) and the Codec Mode Request derived for the second downlink (CMR2 within MS2) in the following way: MS2 shall send the CMR2 back to BTS2 in the usual way. BTS2 shall either accept this CMR2 (default) or may modify it according to network control needs: CMR2´. Then BTS2 shall send the CMR2´ further uplink to its TRAU2, to TRAU1 and downlink to BTS1 (see 3GPP TS 28.062 on how this transmission shall be handled on Abis and A interfaces). BTS1 combines the received CMR2´ with its own derived CMC1 by taking the minimum of both values. If needed, BTS1 may modify this minimum value according to own network control (--> CMC1´´) and shall send it finally downlink to MS1 as CMC. The identical procedure shall be performed in the reverse direction. Annex C gives an informative description.\n\n3.1.3\tOperation at handover with ongoing Tandem Free Operation\n\nBefore and during an handover at one or both sides of the MS-to-MS connection, it may be needed to freeze the codec mode adaptation for a short while, e.g. to optimise the common Active Codec Set, or to allow fast (re-)synchronisation between BTS and TRAU or to optimise the CMI Phase in downlink. Both BTSs may therefore enable or disable the codec mode adaptation (see 3GPP TS 28.062). As long as the codec mode adaptation is frozen to a specific codec mode, then this codec mode shall be used in both directions as long as tandem free operation is ongoing, or tandem free operation shall be discontinued. The Codec Mode Requests from the MSs may be taken into account to decide whether to continue TFO or not, but not for codec mode adaptation.",

Even though the radio access and the core network signalling in principle supports up to 11 bearers, the UE capability was limited only to 8 data bearers. Since LTE Rel-8 operators have launched a number of new services, and it has become more and more evident that more than 8 radio bearers will be needed to support simultaneously all the services. Without this extension there can be risk of inconsistent end user service behaviour that will ultimately prevent adding further QoS based services for a UE. It also worth noting that LTE Rel-8 has a restriction of having 8 AM bearers or 5AM+3 UM data bearers, which limits further availability for emerging differentiated data services. As an example, there can be user cases and scenarios where up to 4 RLC AM might be needed.\n\nIn response to the aforementioned limitations, TSG RAN agreed to instantiate a new LTE Rel-15 WI aiming to remove those restrictions by increasing the number of supported data radio bearers.\n\nLTE Rel-8 functionality is limited to 8 data radio bearers, which was never revised in later releases. And even though radio access and the core network signalling supports in principle up to 11 data bearers, MAC header design has logical channel ID space only for 8 bearers.\n\nRAN WG2 decided to extend the MAC header logical channel ID space from 32 to 64 code points, which allows for not only extending the number of supported data radio bearers, but also introduces a possibility to add more MAC control elements in the future. After extensive discussions between RAN and SA WGs, it was concluded to extend the number of supported data radio bearers to 15 to minimize impact to the existing information elements on the NAS and CN signalling. It is also worth noting that extended number of LTE data radio bearers is also aligned with the 5G/NR technology, in which the minimum UE requirement is to support 16 data radio bearers.\n\nAs for RAN WG3, it has been concluded that radio access interfaces already can support up to 15 data radio bearers. In addition it, there also exist procedures to handle various error cases when e.g. one eNB does not support as many bearers as has been configured by the source eNB. As a summary, no changes were introduced in RAN WG3.\n\nFinally, it bears mentioning that even though this WI aimed at increasing the number of data radio bearers for LTE connected to EPC, same enhancements can be supported by a UE supporting LTE connected to 5GC, i.e. architecture options 5 and 7. In those deployment cases when both LTE and NR are connected to the same 5GC, it allows operator to deploy and use same services irrespective of the radio access technology that a UE is configured with.",

When the Serving RNS (RNS-A) makes the decision to perform the SRNS Relocation procedure it will send an IU-RELOCATION-REQUIRED message to the 3G_MSC (3G_MSCA). The IU-RELOCATION-REQUIRED message shall contain the identifier of the target RNS to which the Relocation is to be performed. When the 3G_MSCA receives the IU-RELOCATION-REQUIRED message it shall begin the process of relocating the serving RNS functionality to the new RNS (RNS-B). The 3G_MSCA shall generate an IU-RELOCATION-REQUEST message to the selected RNS (RNS-B). For the relocation of a speech call to UTRAN Iu mode, 3G_MSCA shall include the NAS Synch Indicator in the Iu-RELOCATION-REQUEST, if the Iu Selected codec to be used after the relocation is different from the Iu Currently used codec.\n\nIf 3G_MSC-A supports SRNS Relocation to a CSG cell and RNS-A includes a CSG ID for the target cell in the IU-RELOCATION-REQUIRED message, then 3G_MSC-A shall check the CSG membership of the UE for the target cell as described in subclause 4.3.1 before generating the Iu-RELOCATION-REQUEST message. If the UE fails the CSG membership check and the target cell is a CSG cell, 3G_MSC-A shall send an IU-RELOCATION-PREPARATION-FAILURE to RNS-A.\nWhen RNS-B receives the IU-RELOCATION-REQUEST message it shall take the necessary action to establish the new Iu transport bearers for each Radio Access Bearer related to 3G_MSCA for the UE in question, this is detailed in the 3GPP TS 25.430 series and 3GPP TS 25.413.\nOnce resource allocation has been completed by RNS-B it shall return an IU-RELOCATION-REQUEST-ACKNOWLEDGE to 3G_MSCA. When this message is received by 3G_MSCA, and 3G_MSCA is ready for the move in Serving RNS functionality, it shall indicate the completion of the preparation phase on the core network side for the SRNS Relocation. An IU-RELOCATION-COMMAND message is sent by 3G_MSCA to RNS-A. RNS-A acts as follows:\n\nWhen the relocation execution trigger is received, RNS-B shall then take the necessary action to assume the role of Serving RNS and shall send an IU-RELOCATION-DETECT message to 3G_MSCA. When the UE is successfully in communication with the RNS-B, then RNS-B shall send an IU-RELOCATION-COMPLETE message to 3G_MSCA.\nAfter 3G_MSCA has received the IU-RELOCATION-COMPLETE message from RNS-B, it shall begin to release the resources associated to the RNS-A. In figures 10 and 11, the resources are released by using the IURELEASECOMMAND sequence.\nIf a failure occurs during the SRNS Relocation attempt, then 3G_MSCA will terminate the relocation to RNS-B. For example, if IU-RELOCATION-FAILURE is returned from RNS-B then 3G_MSCA will terminate the relocation to RNS-B and send IU-RELOCATION-PREPARATION-FAILURE to RNS-A. If IU-RELOCATION-CANCEL is returned from RNS-A, then 3G_MSCA will terminate the relocation to RNS-B and send IU-RELOCATION-CANCEL-ACKNOWLEDGE to RNS-A.\n\nIn all cases the existing connection to the UE shall not be cleared except in the case of expiry of the timer for receipt of Iu-RELOCATION-COMPLETE.\nDuring the period that the UE is not in communication with the network, 3G_MSCA shall queue all appropriate messages. All messages shall be delivered to the UE once communication is resumed. In the case of an Intra-3G_MSC SRNS Relocation (with or without change of  radio resources) on 3G_MSCB, then the messages shall be queued by 3G_MSCB.",

However, it utilizes the identity information received in SIP signalling.\n\nThe untruncated name is delivered in the \"display-name\" parameter of the From header field and/or P-Asserted-Identity header field that the terminating Application Server sends to the terminating UE.\n\nThe metadata will be delivered in one or more Call-Info header field(s). The eCNAM service logic in the AS assembles and formats several data elements (subject to local policy). eCNAM metadata may include type of call, location of a business, or language of the originator. Furthermore, eCNAM metadata may include the results of robocalling analytics that are used to alert the subscriber of possible scams. Typically, service providers partner with analytics providers that offer risk indicators about incoming calls (e.g., known scammers). The results of such analytics are relayed to the user in the form of text strings and/or icons to be displayed on his/her UE. The eCNAM Call-Info header fields support the delivery of text and icons. Given the changing nature of scams, the results of the analytics are expected to vary. eCNAM provides the advantage of a flexible \"envelope\" - namely the Call-Info header field(s) - that delivers different types of payload without having to modify existing standards frequently.\n\nReferences",

LTE radio network dimensioning is typically optimized for data services. To avoid negative impacts on user experience for VoLTE subscribers in areas with weak LTE coverage, a handover to 2G or 3G is performed sooner, i.e. at a higher RSRP level, for UEs with established voice bearers compared to UEs with only data bearers.\n\nAs in the Technical Specification for Multimedia Telephony Service over IMS (MTSI), TS 26.114, which is used as basis for the GSMA IR.92 VoLTE profile, there have been several tools for increased robustness of speech calls with initial selection of Codecs and their Configuration and in-call dynamic rate and mode adaptation and application layer redundancy. EVS (Enhanced Voice Services), especially the EVS Channel Aware mode, demonstrates higher robustness against transmission errors than AMR and AMR-WB codecs.\n\nBased on the above provided background and depending on network dimensioning, which typically targets at data services, the VoLTE coverage may be a function of the selected codec and its configuration, its rate adaptation, and potentially the applied application layer redundancy, as well as the required QoS of the VoLTE bearer. It is adopted that a new QoS parameter Maximum Packet Loss Rate in UL and DL directions is defined and sent from PCRF to eNB. At reception of the IMS service information from the P-CSCF, if configured through policy, the PCRF determines the Maximum Packet Loss Rate for UL and DL based on the IMS service information e.g. codec and sends it to PCEF along with the PCC rule for the voice media. This parameter is transferred to the eNB to support it for handover threshold decision.\n\nBased on the analysis/evaluation of this eVoLP WID, the existing 3GPP 4G specifications TS 23.401, 23.203 and 5G specifications TS 23.501, 23.502, 23.503 have been modified according to it.\n\nReferences",

In that case the codec bit rate is reduced so that more throughput is left on the radio interface to add protection. The principle when TFO is active is that as soon as one side detects the need to downgrade the codec rate, it informs the other side and the codec mode is immediately downgraded. There is no negotiation before downgrading.\n\nC.1.1\tUplink downgrading\n\nThe following figure shows the uplink adaptation due to detection by the BTS1 of a bad quality in the uplink from the MS1.

The codec mode adaptation must be performed on the far end MS (MS2), where the source encoder is located. In that case the round trip delay before the downlink adaptation is effective has an high impact. If TFO would not be active, the round trip delay would be smaller, because the Codec Mode Request sent by the BTS1 to the TRAU1 would be immediately taken into account by the TRAU1 and the new codec mode applied in downlink: without TFO ongoing the (tandem) source encoder is located in TRAU1.",

As in the macrocell case, N = 6 paths are modeled. We list the entire procedure but only describe the details of the steps that differ from the corresponding step of the macrocell procedure.\n\nStep 1: Choose the urban microcell environment.\n\nStep 2: Determine various distance and orientation parameters.\n\nStep 3: Determine the bulk path loss and log normal shadow fading parameters.\n\nStep 4: Determine the random delays for each of the N multipath components. For the microcell environment, N = 6. The delays n = 1, … , N are i.i.d. random variables drawn from a uniform distribution from 0 to 1.2 s.\n\nStep 5:  The minimum of these delays is subtracted from all so that the first delay is zero. The delays are quantized in time to the nearest 1/16th chip interval as described in Clause 5.3.1. When the LOS model is used, the delay of the direct component will be set equal to the first arriving path with zero delay.\n\nStep 6: Determine random average powers for each of the N multipath components. The PDP consists of N=6 distinct paths that are uniformly distributed between 0 and 1.2s. The powers for each path are exponentially decaying in time with the addition of a lognormal randomness, which is independent of the path delay:\n\nStep 7: Determine  AoDs for each of the N multipath components. The AoDs (with respect to the LOS direction) are i.i.d. random variables drawn from a uniform distribution over -40 to +40 degrees:\n\nAssociate the AoD of the nth pathwith the power of the nth path . Note unlike the macrocell environment, the AoDs do not need to be sorted before being assigned to a path power. When the LOS model is used, the AoD for the direct component is set equal to the line-of-sight path direction.\n\nStep 8: Randomly associate the multipath delays with AoDs.\n\nStep 9: Determine the powers, phases, and offset AoDs of the M = 20 sub-paths for each of the N paths at the BS. The offsets are given in Table 5.2, and the resulting per-path AS is 5 degrees instead of 2 degrees for the macrocell case.

The AoAs are i.i.d Gaussian random variables\n\nwhere and  is the relative power of the nth path from Step 5.\n\nWhen the LOS model is used, the AoA for the direct component is set equal to the line-of-sight path direction.\n\nStep 11: Determine the offset AoAs of the M = 20 sub-paths for each of the N paths at the MS.\n\nStep 12: Associate the BS and MS paths and sub-paths.  Sub-paths are randomly paired for each path, and the sub-path phases defined at the BS and MS are maintained.\n\nStep 13: Determine the antenna gains of the BS and MS sub-paths as a function of their respective sub-path AoDs and AoAs.\n\nStep 14: Apply the path loss based on the BS to MS distance and the log normal shadow fading determined in Step 3 as bulk parameters to each of the sub-path powers of the channel model.\n\nThe values in Table 5.2 are selected to produce a biased standard deviation equal to 2, 5, and 35 degrees, which is equivalent to the per-path power weighted azimuth spread for equal power sub-paths.",

It is extremly simple and lightweight messaging protocol based on publish / subscribe mechanism.\n\nIn case of current high bandwidth connection (like ordinary internet, WiFi, Cellular), we already have so wide varieties of protocols like http, ftp, sip etc. Most of these protocols is generating relatively large traffic even though it can be considered as almost nothing with recent broadband communication technology and it would not be a big issue even with IoT devices if the devices is based on celluar network (e.g, WCDMA or LTE). However, this kind of protocol can cause untolerable amount of traffic for the devices that is based on very low throughput and small sized packet system like 6LoWPAN. For this kind of low throughput/small packet based system, we would need very light , simple and small sized application layer protocol. MQTT is one of the most popular protocol that meets this requirement.\n\nFor learning any kind of protocol, my personal approach is almost always same. To understand the packet (or frame) structure and then following through a couple of example protol sequences line by line. Sometimes I practice decoding the captured hex stream by hand based on Packet Structure specification. I will do the same thing here.\n\nProtocol Sequence of MQTT is very simple as illustrated below. First, Client (IoT End Device) request connection to a Broker (a kind of server). If the connection accepted, the device (client) would send 'SUBSRIBE' message saying \"I want to get this and this kind of data. So please send me the data whenever those data is upadated on your side (Broker)\". If this request is accepted by Broker, the broker would send the data to the device whenever any new data comes into the database. For more details on profocol sequence, see 'Protocol Sequence' section. For more details on the structure and contents of each message, refer to Packet structure section.\n\nEven though the description and examples came from myself, the packet structure shown here is based on MQTT V3.1 Protocol Specification by International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) Eurotech. Format representation is modified a little bit for easier understanding for myself.\n\nFollowing is one example protocol sequence that I captured from my trial with HiveMQ Websocket Client. You may get a little bit different variations if you try on your own, but overall procedure and message structure would be similar to the example shown here. Give it a try on your own and you will get used to it very quickly. MQTT is one of the simplest protocol you can see in wireless communication area and I think this would be the biggest reason why MQTT is adopted as one of the dominant protocols in IoT.\n\nYes, Try with HiveMQ Websocket Client. This is what I used to capture the most of sample log for this page.",

This will enable broader range of verticals to integrate with 3GPP systems. Currently, multiple northbound API-related specifications already exist (e.g. APIs for Service Capability Exposure Function (SCEF) defined in TS 23.682 [1], APIs for the interface between MBMS service provider and BM-SC defined in TR 26.981 [2]).\n\nFor API consumers or invokers (in particular for 3rd party API developers), a consistent and uniform API framework across multiple northbound API specifications is necessary. In 3GPP Release-15, a Common API Framework (CAPIF) was introduced to support the common API aspects (e.g. authentication, authorization, publishing, discovery, access control policy, etc.), which allows the northbound service APIs to be integrated into CAPIF, such that the API invokers can utilize a single framework for accessing and invoking the 3GPP northbound APIs.\n\nTR 23.722 [3] is a (Stage 2) technical report that analyses existing API frameworks, and identifies requirements and potential architecture solutions to support a common approach for API development within 3GPP, including recommendations for the normative work.\n\nTS 23.222 [4] specifies the (Stage 2) functional architecture model, procedures and information flows needed to support the CAPIF, and guidelines for a consistent development of northbound API (service and CAPIF APIs) in 3GPP.\n\nTS 29.222 [5] specifies the detailed (Stage 3) APIs messages and protocols needed to support CAPIF, based on the Stage 2 functional architecture.\n\nThe CAPIF functional model is illustrated in Figure 2-1. The functional model describes the CAPIF core function (CCF) and API provider domain functions i.e. API exposing function (AEF), API publishing function (APF) and API management function (AMF), and as well as the reference points between these functions and the API invoker/consumer.\n\nThe functional model as described in TS 23.222 [4], specified architecture-level procedures and information flows for common API aspects, including onboarding, offboarding, publishing, unpublishing, update of service APIs, discovery, registration, authentication, authorization, logging, auditing, monitoring, and topology hiding.\n\nIt further specified the application of the functional model to CAPIF deployments (both centralized and distributed deployment), and also CAPIF relationship with network exposure functions defined in 3GPP systems (EPS and 5GS).\n\nThe detailed API specification (Stage 3) supporting the CAPIF functional model is provided in TS 29.222 [5], which translates the procedures and interactions over the reference points into following 9 API services (8 CAPIF core function services and 1 API exposing function service):\n\nReferences\n\n11.2.2\tNorthbound APIs for SCEF - SCS/AS Interworking\n\nSummary based on the input provided by Huawei, HiSilicon in SP-171032.\n\nStarting from Rel-13, 3GPP defined the Service Capabilities Exposure Function (SCEF) framework for exposure of those 3GPP network capabilities to the application domain. However, up until Rel-15, 3GPP specified neither the SCEF functional architecture nor its interactions with Service Capability Servers or Application Servers (SCS/AS), i.e. with the application domain. 3GPP was relying on other standardization fora such as OMA or oneM2M.\n\nTriggered by interactions with oneM2M, 3GPP started with Rel-15 to specify the northbound APIs from SCEF to support oneM2M specifications to facilitate a useable end-to-end M2M architecture.\n\nThe services and capabilities offered by SCEF to Service Capability Servers or Application Servers (application domain) include:\n\nThe interface between the SCEF and the SCS/AS is referred to as \"T8\" interface. This feature specifies the architectural description (including message flows, and parameters) of the T8 interface.\n\nThe T8 interface supports offline and online charging. The charging architecture and scenarios specific to Northbound API, as well as the mapping of the common 3GPP charging architecture onto the Northbound API, are specified in TS 32.240 [2].\n\nThe Northbound API charging architecture, charging principles and scenarios, definition of charging information and content of the CDRs for offline charging are specified in TS 32.254 [3].\n\nThe corresponding AVPs and ASN.1 are specified in TS 32.298 [4] and TS 32.299 [5].\n\nReferences",

Single Cell Point To Multiploint (SC-PTM) uses the eMBMS system architecture, providing enhancements in the air interface to improve radio efficiency and to reduce latency. SC-PTM supports broadcast/multicast services over single cell, and the broadcast/multicast area can be dynamically adjusted cell by cell according to user's distribution.\n\nSC-PTM transfers the broadcast/multicast services using LTE downlink shared channel (i.e. PDSCH), and it is scheduled using a common RNTI (i.e. Group-RNTI) for a group of users. The SC-PTM scheduling is quite agile and radio resources could be dynamically assigned in time and frequency domain by PDCCH based on real time traffic load TTI by TTI.\n\nSC-PTM is especially suitable for scenarios where broadcast/ multicast service is expected to be delivered to a limited number of cells due to user interests and the concerned cells may dynamically change due to user movement. SC-PTM allows efficient radio utilisation and flexible deployment of number of applications, e.g. critical communications, traffic information for cars and on-demand TV services, etc.\n\nLTE Broadcast Test Specifications demonstrate Device Conformity - 3GPP news article July 2015",

(NOTE : I got most of these information from Ref [13]. I would recommend you to read through this document at least once if you have time)\n\nNo new technology can be invented overnight. We all understand this. However, we don't want to wait forever until everything is ready all at once. A common practice in this case is to split those requirement/wishlist into multiple chunks and attack them chunk by chunk. In some technology, they call these chunk as 'Stage' (like Stage 1, Stage 2 etc) and in some technology they call them as 'Phase' (e.g, Phase 1, Phase 2 etc). In 802.11ac, they call them as Wave (e.g, Wave 1, Wave 2 etc). 802.11ac has been evolved as two Waves (at least as of now, Aug 2016) as listed below.\n\nIf you have a 802.11ac WLAN Card (device), the first thing you have to do is to figure out the Access Point (AP) around the device support 802.11ac. (Actually you don't need to figure out this, your WLAN device will figure out :).\n\nThen how your WLAN device will figure out whether the AP support 802.11ac or not ? It is by decoding the special information signal from the AP called Beacon. If your AP support 802.11ac, it will broadcast Beancon signal containing following information.\n\nFollowing Beacon Signal is the one from a WLAN Test equipment, Anritsu MT8862. Anritsu kindly provided me a full sample log starting from Beacon through user data and it will be a great resource for my study. I will sharing more as I learn more from the log. You can see the test setup on how this log is captured.\n\nIt may look simple two lines of information, but it will contain a lot of details of the 802.11ac capability that the AP supports. Following is the full decoded information.\n\n.... .... .... .... .... .... .... ..10 = Maximum MPDU Length: 11 454 (0x00000002)\n\n.... .... .... .... .... .... .... 00.. = Supported Channel Width Set: Neither 160MHz\n\n.... .... .... .... .... .... .0.. .... = Short GI for 160MHz and 80+80MHz: Not supported\n\n.... .... .... .... 000. .... .... .... = Compressed Steering Number of Beamformer Antennas\n\n.... .... .... .000 .... .... .... .... = Number of Sounding Dimensions: 1 (0x00000000)\n\n.... .... .0.. .... .... .... .... .... = +HTC-VHT Capable (VHT variant HT Control field):\n\n.... ..11 1... .... .... .... .... .... = Max A-MPDU Length: 1 048 575 (0x00000007)\n\n.... 00.. .... .... .... .... .... .... = VHT Link Adaptation: No Feedback (0x00000000)\n\n...0 .... .... .... .... .... .... .... = Rx Antenna Pattern Consistency: Not supported\n\n..0. .... .... .... .... .... .... .... = Tx Antenna Pattern Consistency: Not supported\n\n...0 0000 0000 0000 = Rx Highest Long GI Data Rate (in Mb/s, 0 = subfield not in use):\n\n...0 0000 0000 0000 = Tx Highest Long GI Data Rate (in Mb/s, 0 = subfield not in use):\n\nCommunication is the exchange of information between two or more parties. The previous section showed how the device can figure out the 802.11ac capability of AP. Then you would ask how the AP can figure out 802.11ac capability of the device. The AP can figure out the device capability from [Probe Request] message from the device as shown below.\n\n.... .... .... .... .... .... .... ..0. = Receive Staggered Sounding: Not supported\n\n.... .... .... .... .00. .... .... .... = Receiver can return explicit uncompressed\n\n...0 0... .... .... .... .... .... .... = Maximum number of space time streams for\n\n.... .... .... .... .... .... .... ..10 = Maximum MPDU Length: 11 454 (0x00000002)\n\n.... .... .... .... 010. .... .... .... = Compressed Steering Number of Beamformer\n\n.... .... .0.. .... .... .... .... .... = +HTC-VHT Capable (VHT variant HT Control\n\n.... ..11 1... .... .... .... .... .... = Max A-MPDU Length:1 048 575 (0x00000007)\n\n...1 .... .... .... .... .... .... .... = Rx Antenna Pattern Consistency:Supported\n\n..1. .... .... .... .... .... .... .... = Tx Antenna Pattern Consistency:Supported\n\nOne of the most important keywords in 802.11ac would VHT. VHT stands for Very High Throughput. You would not need any additional explanation on what this means. The meaning is obvious and self-explanatory.\n\nThe question is how to achieve VHT and what kind of new frames and protocols are introduced to implement this.\n\nIn wireshark log, you may see this framing information from Radiotap Header as shown below.\n\n802.11ac support various types of bandwidth combination like 20 Mhz, 80 Mhz, 160 Mhz. Then the question would 'how do they allocate the bandwidth ?'. Statically or Dynamically ?\n\nStatic allocation means that Transmitter (Initiator) and Reciever(Responder) negotiate and determines the bandwidth during early stage of connection setup and keep it same until the end of communication (a session).\n\nDynamic allocation means that Transmitter and Reciever SOMEHOW negotiate/determine the bandwidth in very short interval even during a single session.\n\n802.11ac picked up the dynamic allocation approach. It allows the change of the bandwidth at every transmission.\n\nThen the question is 'HOW ?'. What kind of negotiation they use to determine/agree upon the bandwidth between Transmitter and Reciever ?\n\nBasic Idea is simple. As you see in Data Transmission in Detail section, basic channel acquisition process for all 802.11 is based on RTS/CTS mechanism. 802.11ac use the same mechanism to determine the avaiable bandwidth dynamically. The idea is to split the whole possible 802.11ac band into multiple blocks of basic segments (e.g, 20 Mhz, 40 Mhz, 80 Mhz etc) and perform the multiple RTS/CTS simulateneously across the multiple frequency block. (It is very similary for Carrier Aggregation in LTE). First, the initiator sends multiple RTS accross the multiple frequency block and wait for CTS. If the initiator recieves CTS accross the all the blocks, it can use all the frequency blocks (very wide aggregated bandwidth). If the initiator recieves only a few CTS for the all transmitted RTS, it uses the smaller bandwidth for which CTS is recieved. (Refer to Ref [9] for the details).\n\nLet me give you a couple of examples with illustration on how Dynamic Bandwidth goes. Here goes only two cases but there can be much more variations on this.\n\nThis is the case where there is no interference between Node A(initiator) and Node B(recipient) and the full bandwith is avaiable for both nodes. Of course, these nodes does not know anything about the bandwidth availability before it completes step 3. Step 0 : Right before Step 1, it is assumed that Node A split the whole 80 Mhz section into 4 contiguous 20 Mhz block and performed carrier sensing for each of these 20 Mhz block. And it is assumed that all of these 20 Mhz block turned out to be available. Step 1 : Node A wait for a certain time period called DIFS(DCF Inter Frame Space), assuming that the scheduling is done in DCF. Step 2 : Node A transmit RTS for each of 20 Mhz block to Node B using 802.11a frame and it is assumed that all of these RTS reached Node B successfully. Step 3 : (Assuming that Node B detected RTS for all of 20 Mhz blocks) Node B transmit CTS using 802.11a frame for every 20 Mhz subblocks. Step 4 : (Assuming that Node A detected CTS for all of 20 Mhz blocks) Node A assumes that all 80Mhz BW is clear/no-interference and transmit the data in 802.11ac mode utilizing the full 80 Mhz. Step 5 : (Assuming that Node B received and decoded the whole data) Node B sends Ack for every 20 Mhz blocks (40 Mhz in total).\n\nThis is the case where there is some interference in some spectrum blocks within the 80 Mhz block on Node B(recipient). Of course, these nodes does not know anything about the bandwidth availability before it completes step 3. Step 0 : Right before Step 1, it is assumed that Node A split the whole 80 Mhz section into 4 contiguous 20 Mhz block and performed carrier sensing for each of these 20 Mhz block. And it is assumed that all of these 20 Mhz block turned out to be available. Step 1 : Node A wait for a certain time period called DIFS(DCF Inter Frame Space), assuming that the scheduling is done in DCF. Step 2 : Node A transmit RTS for each of 20 Mhz block to Node B using 802.11a frame. Step 3 : (In various reason, e.g, Node B failed to receive RTS due to interference or Medium is busy based on carrier sensing ) Node B transmit CTS using 802.11a frame for only two consecutive 20 Mhz blocks. Step 4 : (Assuming that Node A detected CTS for the two 20 Mhz blocks) Node A assumes that only 40Mhz BW is clear/no-interference and transmit the data in 802.11ac mode utilizing the 40 Mhz. Step 5 : (Assuming that Node B received and decoded the whole data) Node B sends Ack for the two 20 Mhz blocks (40 Mhz in total).\n\nIn 802.11ac, Following new Frame Types are added to the existing type. Most of New Frametype is for impelementing Channel Measurement and Report to perform MU-MIMO Beamforming.\n\nThis frame is used for BeamFormer (AP) to initiate Channel Measurement Process. (Refer to 802.11ac 8.3.1.20 VHT NDP Announcement frame format for the details)\n\nIt indicates the number of columns, Nc, in the Compressed Beamforming Feedback Matrix\n\nThis frame is used for BeamFormee (user) to report channel measurement result (Refer to 802.11ac 8.5.23.2 VHT Compressed Beamforming frame format for the details)\n\nTo perform proper beamforming for specific devices, it is crucial to figure out accurate channel condition between BeamFormer and BeanFormee. To figure out the channel condition, BeamFormer and BeamFormee performs a specific sequence of calibration process and this process is called Channel Measurement or Sounding process. It goes as follows.\n\nRefer to 802.11ac 9.31.5.2 Rules for VHT sounding protocol sequences, Figure 9-41a and Figure 9-41a for the details.\n\nNOTE : The fundamental purpose of this complicated process is to figure out the charateristics (nature) of radio channel between the Access Point and Devices. This is also called 'Channel Sounding'. During this process, no user data is conveyed. It means this process can be a kind of overhead (throughput degradation factor). If AP can best optimize the communication by extracting the most suitable BeamForming parameters from this process, this process can give a overall throughput gain. However, if AP failed to get the best BeamForming parameters from this process, this would just create unncessary overhead.\n\nMU-MIMO stands for Multi User MIMO and this is adopted only in 802.11ac (not in 802.11n and lower). When we say MIMO(Multi Input Multi Output), it normally mean SU-MIMO(Single User MIMO), which is a MIMO targeted to only one device(user). On the contrary, MU-MIMO is the MIMO targeted to multiple user simulateneously. It mean that in MU-MIMO the transmitter (Access Point) can transmite the multiple stream of data targeted to multiple user.\n\nIt sounds fancy, right ? However, the implementation of this technology would not be as easy as it sound and real performance would not be as good as expected. Probably it would need to go through a long way of evolution. Let's think of some of the challenges and possible issues related to MU-MIMO\n\nPutting aside the practical feasibility of this MU-MIMO, the specification is done. In most case of technology (even though it is not all the case), once the specification is issued the technology continues to evolve and get better and better.\n\n802.11ac MU-MIMO Beamforming is expressed in a mathematical expression as follows (this is based on 802.11ac 22.3.11 SU-MIMO and DL-MU-MIMO Beamforming)\n\nWhenever a new version of any technology comes out, one of the most concerning thing is compatibility. Can this new stuff work with all of those old stuffs out there already ? You would have the same questions about 802.11ac. Is 802.11ac compatitle with the existing (previous) techology (e.g, 802.11a and 802.11n) ? The answer is Yes. 802.11ac is designed from beginning to be compatible with 802.11a / n both for Access point and devices.\n\n[12] How to validate the WI-FI Information within Wireshark Part I: Determining the WLAN capabilities",

To be honest, I haven't seen many cases people using this term in such a generic term in the field. Personally I think it is because it might not have been clearly defined at the beginning or so many diverse type of encoding technology came out and the definition got more fuzzy now. Even when people use the term 'Encoding', they tend to use it in a very specific context. So you don't get clear idea of the context in which the term is used, you might not clearly understand what it realy mean.\n\nIn this page, I will try to explain the term 'Encoding' in a generic term because it is how the term is described in many text book.\n\nIn very generic form, 'Encoding' can be described as in the following diagram. Encoding is a process (or technique) to convert 'one form of Thing' into 'another form of thing'.\n\nNow the question is what do you mean by 'Thing' in the above description. It would be even more difficult to define this 'Thing' because there are so many different kind of 'Things' that can be plug into this statement. The most practical way is just to see a lot of examples. However, in most textbook they tried to categorize the 'Thing' into two large groups called 'Digital' and 'Analog'. Using all the possible combination of the two category, they categorize the type of encoders into roughly 4 types as below.\n\nLet's briefly think of what each of these type mean. Actually each one of these topics are huge topic and almost impossible to describe it clearly with a few lines. So don't get disappointed even if you don't understand this description clearly just by reading this page.\n\nAnalog Data => Analog Signal : This is to convert one form of analog signal to another form of analog signal. Some example of this type are AM (Amplitude Modulation), FM(Frequency Modulation) and PM(Phase Modulation) etc. One typical example for this would be in AM / FM radio broadcasting. When people talk in a microphone, the sound wave is a Analog data and when it goes through the communication system, it converted (Encoded) into AM or FM electrical signal (Of course, you would need further study to understand what AM / FM mean).\n\nAnalog Data => Digital Signal : This is to convert an analog data to a digital signal. This is often called 'Digitization'. Typical example of this type is PCM (Pulse Code Modulation).\n\nDigital Data => Analog Signal : This is to convert a digital form of data into Analog form of signal. Typical examples of this type are ASK(Amplitude Shift Keying), FSK(Frequency Shift Keying) and PSK(Phase Shift Keying).\n\nDigital Data => Digital Signal : This is to convert a digital data to a digital signal. Typical examples of this types are RZ / NRZ, Menchester Coding, Bipolar AMI, B8ZS, Block Coding (3B/4B, 5B/6B, 8B/10B) etc. These are widely used in Digital communication over wireline.",

The location information for each MS is stored in functional units called location registers. Functionally, there are two types of location registers:\nSee also 3GPP TS 23.002 where the network architecture is described, and 3GPP TS 23.008 where the data stored in the location registers are described.\nThe action taken by a MS in order to provide location information to the PLMN will be referred to as location updating.\n2.2\tLocation area and MSC area\nThe MSC area is composed of the area covered by all base stations controlled by the MSC. An MSC area may consist of several location areas. A location area is an area in which, after having performed a location update once, MSs may roam without being required to perform subsequent location updates for reason of location change. A location area consists of one or more cells.\n\nFor further details of the network architecture, see 3GPP TS 23.002.\n2.3\tLocation area identification\nThe Location Area Identification (LAI) plan is part of the base station identification plan. The base stations are identified uniquely (see 3GPP TS 23.003).\n2.4\tIMSI detach/attach operation\nThe support of IMSI detach/attach operation is mandatory in MSs. The facility is optional in the fixed infrastructure of the PLMN.\n2.4.1\tExplicit IMSI detach/attach\nExplicit IMSI detach operation is the action taken by an MS to indicate to the PLMN that the station has entered an inactive state (e.g. the station is powered down). Explicit IMSI attach operation is the action taken by an MS to indicate that the station has re-entered an active state (e.g. the station is powered up).\n2.4.2\tImplicit IMSI detach\n\nImplicit IMSI detach operation is the action taken by the VLR to mark an MS as detached when there has been no successful contact between the MS and the network for a time determined by the implicit detach timer. The value of the implicit detach timer is derived from the periodic location updating timer; when the MSC/VLR applies Mobility Management Congestion Control to a MS, the MSC/VLR may need to adjust the Implicit Detach timer as specified in clause 3.7.2. During an established radio contact, the implicit detach timer shall be prevented from triggering implicit detach. At the release of the radio connection, the implicit detach timer shall be reset and restarted. Implicit IMSI detach shall also be performed in the case of a negative response to an IMEI check.\n2.5\tUse of the term mobile station (MS) in the present document\n\nIn order to simplify the text the term Mobile Station (MS) as used in relation to location management refers to the entity where the IMSI is stored, i.e., in card operated MSs the term Mobile Station (MS) refers to the card.\n2.6\tPaging area\nAs an option, and for paging optimization purpose, the VLR may control Paging Areas. A Paging Area (PgA) is composed of up to 5 Location Areas, and the MSC area is composed of several Paging Areas. Paging areas may overlap each other. The Paging Area is stored in the HLR and updated at each paging area change. The Paging Area is sent by the HLR to the VLR at roaming number request and may be used by the MSC/VLR for paging (e.g. when LAI is not known, after MSC/VLR restart) (see 3GPP TS 23.018 [5a]).",

AMR_CONFIG_REQ contains several parameters: Active Codec Set (ACS), Initial Codec Mode (ICM), and a pair of threshold and hysteresis values (THRESHj and HYSTj). Table 3.2.2.3.5a shows the format.\n\nThe ACS and ICM parameters are coded in the same way as defined in 3GPP TS 44.018 [2].\n\nAll threshold and hysteresis parameters in the AMR_CONFIG_REQ are valid only for downlink direction. The coding of these parameters is given in section 3.4.2.\n\nIf the ACS consists of n modes (n=1,2,3), then only THRESH1…THRESHn-1 and HYST1…HYSTn-1 are defined. The remaining bits are reserved for future use and shall be set to \"1\".\n\nIf the ACS consists of four modes, then the complete set of thresholds/hysteresis can not be sent with this message. In that case, all THRESHj and HYSTj fields are reserved for future use and shall be set to \"1\". Similar, if the BTS has no threshold and hysteresis parameters for the given configuration, then all THRESHj and HYSTj field bits shall be set to \"1\" to indicate that they are undefined. The THRESH_REQ  message shall be used to transmit these parameters at a later point in time. As long as the MS has no defined threshold and hysteresis parameters it shall use the Initial Codec Mode for the Codec Mode Request.\n\nAlternatively,  in case of four codec modes, the BTS may send the three threshold and hysteresis parameters as shown in table 3.2.2.3.5.b. The coding of HYSTc is given in section 3.4.2. All three hysteresis values (HYST1/2/3) are in that case represented by one common HYSTc value (HYST1 = HYST2 = HYST3 = HYSTc).\n\nIn this way the ACS and the associated thresholds may be sent in one single message, allowing an immediate Codec Mode Request generation within the MS for the new configuration.

Upon detection of a valid PDCCH, the device follows downlink control information contained in the PDCCH, e.g., the scheduling decision so that the device receives PDSCH (or transmits PUSCH) accordingly.\n\nThe PDCCHs are transmitted in one or more control resource sets (CORESETs). A CORESET spans overone, two or three OFDM symbol(s) in time domain and over a configurable bandwidth in the frequency domain. This is needed in order to handle devices with different bandwidth capabilities and also beneficial from a forward-compatibility perspective. One control channel element (CCE) is defined as 6 resource element groups (REGs), where 1 REG is composed of 12 resource elements (REs). In a CORESET, a PDCCH with DM-RS can be mapped on one or more CCEs as shown in Figure 5.5.4.5-1. Different number of CCEs (aggregation level) provides different coding rate for the control channels.\n\nThere are different formats for DCI transmitted on a PDCCH as shown in Table 5.5.4.5-1. A UE monitors one or more PDCCH candidates for DCI with CRC scrambled by a certain RNTI in PDCCH common search space (CSS) set and/or UE-specific search space (USS) set. DCI format is distinguished by the PDCCH payload size and the RNTI scrambling the CRC.\n\nPDSCH is used to transmit one or two transport blocks (TBs). A DCI in a PDCCH can assign a PDSCH transmission with DM-RS (and other RS if any). The PDSCH is decoded based on the information in the PDCCH, for example, time/frequency-domain resource, modulation, and layer. PDSCH transmissions are processed with durations from 2 to 14 symbols. The number of layers for PDSCH transmissions is 8. HARQ feedback/retransmission is supported for PDSCH transmissions as mentioned in Section 5.5.4.7.",

If you are more familiar with how Bluetooth works, you may take 'WiFi Direct' as 'WiFi working like a Bluetooth, but it is much faster since it is communicating over WiFi'.\n\nAs of now (May 2015), I saw most of lated mobile phones support this function and you may find a lot of digital TVs and other electronic commodities with labels on it 'WiFi Direct'.\n\nIn this page, I will talk about how WiFi Direct works (In 3GPP Rel 12, D2D is proposed for LTE and we may see similar concept in LTE when D2D will be finalized. They would call the LTE version of direct communication as LTE Direct). Overall protocol sequence to establish WiFi Direct connection can be illustrated as below.\n\nDiscovery : This step is basically same as the discovery process in normal WiFi operation (Refer to WLAN Protocol page for the details). The main difference between WiFi Direct and Normal WiFi operation in this step is that both device is transmitting Beacon with SSID = DIRECT in WiFi Direct device. Or they can perform discovery via Probe Request/Probe Response.\n\nGroup Owner Negotiation : Even though 'WiFi Direct' may sound like 'the two device would communicate with equal right', in reality one of the device will be working as Access Point (a kind of Master) and the other device will act as a slave. Group Owner Negotiation is a process to determine who will become the Master and who will become the slave. This step is done three step handshake - GO Negotiation Request, GO Negotiation Response, Go Negotiation Confirmation.\n\nSwitch to AP mode on Group Owner : Once a Group Owner(GO) is determined, the grouple owner switches its chipset to AP mode (Access Point mode) and start working as a Access Point.\n\nAttach Authentication : Now the other device (the device not selected as Group Owner) performs attach process with the GO device. Basically this is similar to normal WiFi operation(Refer to WLAN Protocol page for the details).\n\nIP Allocation : At last, GO device allocate IP to Non-GO devices to complete IP layer end-to-end communication path.",

As in the link level simulations, the description is in the context of a downlink system where the BS transmits to a MS; however the material in this clause (with the exception of Clause 5.7 on Ioc modelling) can be applied to the uplink as well.\n\nAs opposed to link simulations which simply consider a single BS transmitting to a single MS, the system simulations typically consist of multiple cells/sectors, BSs, and MSs. Performance metrics such as throughput and delay are collected over D drops, where a \"drop\" is defined as a simulation run for a given number of cells/sectors, BSs, and MSs, over a specified number of frames. During a drop, the channel undergoes fast fading according to the motion of the MSs. Channel state information is fed back from the MSs to the BSs, and the BSs use schedulers to determine which user(s) to transmit to. Typically, over a series of D drops, the cell layout and locations of the BSs are fixed, but the locations of the MSs are randomly varied at the beginning of each drop. To simplify the simulation, only a subset of BSs will actually be simulated while the remaining BSs are assumed to transmit with full power.  The goal of this clause is to define the methodology and parameters for generating the spatial and temporal channel coefficients between a given base and mobile for use in system level simulations. For an S element BS array and a U element MS array, the channel coefficients for one of N multipath components (note that these components are not necessarily time resolvable, meaning that the time difference between successive paths may be less than a chip period) are given by an S -by- U  matrix of complex amplitudes. We denote the channel matrix for the nth multipath component (n = 1,…,N) as . It is a function of time t because the complex amplitudes are undergoing fast fading governed by the movement of the MS. The overall procedure for generating the channel matrices consists of three basic steps:\n\nClauses 5.2, 5.3, and 5.4 give the details for the general procedure. Figure 5.1 below provides a roadmap for generating the channel coefficients. Clause 5.5 specifies optional cases that modify the general procedure. Clause 5.6 describes the procedure for generating correlated log normal user parameters used in Clause 5.3. Clause 5.7 describes the method for accounting for intercell interference. Clause 5.8 presents calibration results.",

The term \"structured procedure\" is used for these sequences.\n1.4\tTest procedures\nTest procedures of the GSM radio interface signalling are described in 3GPP TS 51.010 and 3GPP TS 51.02x series.\n\n1.5\tUse of logical channels\nThe logical control channels are defined in 3GPP TS 45.002. In the following those control channels are considered which carry signalling information or specific types of user packet information:\nTwo service access points are defined on signalling layer 2 which are discriminated by their Service Access Point Identifiers (SAPI) (see 3GPP TS 44.006):\nLayer 3 selects the service access point, the logical control channel and the mode of operation of layer 2 (acknowledged, unacknowledged or random access, see 3GPP TS 44.005 and 3GPP TS 44.006) as required for each individual message.\n1.6\tOverview of control procedures\n1.6.1\tList of procedures\nThe following procedures are specified in the Technical Specification:\nThe elementary procedures can be combined to form structured procedures. Examples of such structured procedures are given in clause 7. This part of the Technical Specification is only provided for guidance to assist implementations.\n\nClause 8 specifies actions to be taken on various error conditions and also provides rules to ensure compatibility with future enhancements of the protocol.\n1.7\tApplicability of implementations\nThe applicability of procedures of this technical specification for the mobile station is dependent on the services and functions which are to be supported by a mobile station.\n1.7.1\tVoice Group Call Service (VGCS) and Voice Broadcast Service (VBS)\nFor mobile stations supporting the Voice Group Call Service or the Voice Broadcast Service, it is explicitly mentioned throughout this technical specification if a certain procedure is applicable only for such a service and, if necessary, how mobile stations not supporting such a service shall behave.\nFor VGCS and VBS, the following possible mobile station implementations exist:\n\nApart from the explicitly mentioned combinations, all possible combinations are optional and supported by this technical specification.\nThe related terms are used in this technical specification, if information on these implementation options is required.\n1.7.2\tGeneral Packet Radio Service (GPRS)\nFor mobile stations supporting the General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), it is explicitly mentioned throughout the technical specification if a certain procedure is applicable only for such a service and, if necessary, how mobile stations not supporting such a service shall behave.\nA GPRS MS may operate in one of the following MS operation modes, see 3GPP TS 23.060:\nThe MS operation mode depends on the services that the MS is attached to, i.e., only GPRS or both GPRS and non-GPRS services, and upon the MS's capabilities to operate GPRS and other GSM services simultaneously. Mobile stations that are capable to operate GPRS services are referred to as GPRS MSs.\n\nIt should be noted that it is possible that for a GPRS MS, the GMM procedures currently described in the ETS do not support combinations of VGCS, VBS and GPRS.

As mentioned, this is a kind of WAN (Wide Area Network), meaning it would have relatively wide coverage. To provide the wide coverage, it forms a kind of network system which is similar to cellular network. As you see in the following illustration, it has a small central access unit called LoRa Gateway (this is similar to Basestation in cellular system).

The process of directed retry involves the assignment of a UE/MS to a radio channel on a cell other than the serving cell. This process is triggered by the assignment procedures, as described in 3GPP TS 48.008, and employs internal or external GSM to UMTS handover procedures as described in subclauses 6.2.2 and 8.2. The successful procedure for a directed retry in case of an intra-3G_MSC GSM to UMTS handover is as shown in figure 40a and as described below.\nIf during the assignment phase, as represented by the A-ASSIGNMENT-REQUEST message, a GSM to UMTS handover becomes necessary, due to radio conditions, congestion or inability to provide the requested bearer service in GSM, then the UE/MS may be handed over to a UMTS cell. If the requested bearer service cannot be provided in GSM, 3G_MSC-A shall indicate in the A-ASSIGNMENT-REQUEST message that handover to UMTS should be performed. When the decision has been made to handover the UE/MS the BSS-A may send an A-ASSIGNMENT-FAILURE message, indicating 'directed retry', before sending the A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message to 3G_MSCA, indicating 'directed retry'. However BSS-A may alternatively send the A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message, indicating 'directed retry', without sending the A-ASSIGNMENT-FAILURE message. Other cause values may be used instead of \"Directed Retry\" in the A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message, this will allow the 3G_MSC to take different actions dependent on the received cause. Upon receipt of the A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message from BSS-A, then 3G_MSCA shall initiate the GSM to UMTS handover as described in subclauses 6.2.2 and 8.2. No resources shall be cleared in the 3G_MSCA or BSS-A for this connection.\n\nAfter receipt of the Iu-RELOCATION-COMPLETE message from RNS-B the assignment procedure shall be considered to be complete and the resources on BSS-A shall be cleared.\nIf a failure occurs during the handover attempt, for example A-HANDOVER-FAILURE returned from BSS-A or Iu-RELOCATION FAILURE from RNS-B then 3G_MSCA will terminate the GSM to UMTS handover to RNS-B. Under these conditions 3G_MSCA may optionally take one of a number of actions:\nThe procedures for Inter-3G_MSC GSM to UMTS handover are also applicable to the directed retry process.

I mean there is slight differences in terms of Uplink resource grid (frame structure). In addition, there is a new unit called RU(Resource Unit) that exisits in LTE-NB but not used in legacy LTE.\n\nUplink Frame Structure of LTE-NB can be summarized in the following three tables. If you can interpret these tables into a correct graphical format, you already understand all the details of Uplink frame structure.

One is 15 Khz (this is same as in legacy LTE) and the other one is 3.75 Khz.\n\nLet's draw a resource grid in a frame based on 15 Khz subcarrier spacing. In this case, you can easily calculate that you can put 12 sub carriers within 180 Khz BW(LTE-NB System Bandwidth). And in 36.211-10.1.2.1, you see there are 20 slots within a radio frame.

In this case, you can easily figure out that you can put 48 sub carriers within 180 Khz BW(LTE-NB System Bandwidth). And in 36.211-10.1.2.1, you see there are 5 slots within a radio frame.

Tech.: Fading\n\nIntuitive understanding of Fading would be simple, but the detailed description is pretty difficult and would be even more difficult to understand the details without going through the complicated mathematical process. This page would start with Intuitive description and try to keep adding the details one by one. It will take long time to complete the pages and will split this into multiple pages if it goes too long.\n\nIn most of the wireless communication environement, a signal out of a transmitter radiate into wide direction and these radiated signal takes different path and arriving at the reciever at different timing and with different signal strength(amplitude). As a result, the signal coming into the reciever is the composite of all the components. As you may learned in high school physics, when thetwo\ncopies of the signal get combined the resulting signal can be an augmented signal or attenuated signal depending on whether the two signal constructively combined or destructively combined.\n\nThen what determines whether the signals constructively combine or destructively combine ? The answer also come from high school physics. The phase of the two signal determines whether the signal constructively combine or destructively combine.\n\nIn wireless communication environment, many copies of the signals get combined at the reciever side and some of them constructively combines and some of them destructively combines. So final result of combination of all the incoming signals become very complicated and the combined signal becomes drastically different from the original signal tranmitted from the source. In most case, the quality\nof the combined signal at the reciever gets poorer (deteriorated) than the original signal. This kind of process of signal deterioration by the multiple propogation path of a signal is called 'Fading'. When we say \"Fading\", it usually implies \"Signal quality gets bad\".\n\nFor more intuitive unerstanding of the fading, I will show you a couple of different aspect of fading you can mesure using various equipments.\n\nFirst, let's compare a faded signal and non-faded signal using a spectrum analyzer. You would get the two results as follows and you will see the highly fluctuating amplitude across the channel bandwidth. (Note : These two capture are not the one from the same signal, so comparing the absolute value of the amplitude does not make any sense. Just take the image of overall amplitude profile).\n\nNow let's look at how the fading influence the signal quality decoded by the reciever. Look at the following samples of constellation for faded and non-faded signal.\n\nNow let's get into even further and I think this is the thing that you would be most interested in. How this fading would influence the final performance. Following graph shows the data rate at PHY layer and PDCP layer. The plot showing at the top (labeled as 'PHY Transmission Rate') is the amount of data being transmitted per second by PHY layer of the transmitter. The plot in the middle\n(labeled as 'PHY throughput with HARQ ACK' is the amount of data getting ACKED per second from the reiever PHY layer. You see there is pretty much gap between the two plots. It means that a considerable portions of the data were failed to get properly decoded by the reciever and the reciever sent NACK for the data. Normally in this case, the transmitter PHY layer retransmits the previous data rather than moving into the next step of the transmission.\n\nThe plot at the bottom (labelled as 'PDCP Transmission Rate') is the amount of data being sent to the lower layer from the transmitter's PDCP layer. You will see another gap here. It is not easy to explain exactly what is causing this gap. In this case, some portions of the gap would come from the overhead of higher layer data structure but majority of the gap would be because PDCP cannot\npush the data down to the lower layer since PHY layer is too busy with retransmitting the previous data rather than transmitting the new data coming from the higher layer.\n\nThere are many factors generating Fading effect. Followings are the list of components (factors) of fading we can think of.\n\nTo study on fading requires the detailed understanding of each of these components. If I express some major components in visual form, it can be presented as follows. Just from the high level view, you should see some typtical pattern from this representation. First notice that the horizontal axis represents 'Distance in Linear Scale'. You may have seen a lot of different plots in various\ntextbook and get confused by those. One of the first step to remove those confusion would be clearly understanding the meaning of axis of the graph. Even for the same things, you would see different shape of plots if you define the meaning of the axis differently. One of the factors from various text confusing you the most is the scale of each axis. For example, in case of path loss graph in some textbook where they represent the axis in log scale you would see a straight line, but in this page you\nare seeing a kind of negative exponential graph since the axis is represented in linear scale.\n\nPath loss is just gradually decreases but not much of fluctuation. In the second plot, you see some fluctuation of the signal strength but the fluctuation frequency over the distance is not that high. In the third plot, you see fluctuations of signal strength and the fluctuation frequency is also pretty high.\n\nWhen you observe a real received signal, you wouldn't see these factors in separate form as in the graph on the left side. What you see at the real reciever is the result of summation of all the factors and it is like the graph on the right side.\n\nProbably the words you might have heard the most frequently when you talking about fading would be 'Fast Fading', 'Slow Fading'. Intuitively it sounds simple. But not easy to find clear/technical defintion for these. How fast it should be to be Fast Fading ? How slow it should be to be Slow Fading ?\n\nI found a very good definition and technical explanation from the reference [2]. It states as follows:\n\nFast Fading is used to describe channels in which Channel Coherence Time < Tansmission Symbol Time. Fast Fading describes a condition where the time duration in which the channel behaves in a correlated mannel is short compared to the time duration of a symbol. Therefore, it can be expected that the fading characteristic of the channel will change several times while a symbol is propagating, leading to distortion of the baseband pulse shape. Analogous to the distortion described as ISI, the distortion take place because the recieved signal's components are not all highly correlated throughout time. Hence, fast fading can cause the baseband pulse to be distorted, resulting in a loss of SNR that often yields an irreducible error rate. Such distorted pulses cause synchronization problems (failure of phase-locked-loop recievers), in addition to difficulties in adequately defining a matched filter.\n\nSlow Fading is used to describe channels in which Channel Coherence Time > Tansmission Symbol Time. Here, the time duration that the channel behaves in a correlated manner is long compared to the time duration of a transmission symbol. Thus, one can expect the channel state to virtually remain unchanged during the time in which a symbol is transmitted. The propaging symbols will likely not suffer from the pulse distortion. The primary degradation in a slow-fading channel, as with flat fading, is loss in SNR.\n\nPath Loss and Shadowing may not be considered to be a part of Fading in narrow sense, but it can be considered as a factor causing the fading in wider sense. Understanding or Modeling the path loss is not that difficult. You may see a mathematical model which you were faimilar with in your high school math. The famous format of anti-proportional to 'something squared'.\n\nModling for Path Loss is done with the respect to the distance between a transmitter and receiver. The key question is ..\n\nTest A) When a transmitter antenna is transmitting a certain (fixed) amount of energy and you put a measurement antenna which is a certain distance (let's call this distance as 'd') and measure the received(measured) energy. Once you get the value at a certain 'd', write down the value. And then move the reciever antenna a little bit further and do the same measurement and write down\nthe value. Repeat this process as you move 'd' further and further and collect all the measured value and plot it on the graph with horizontal axis = d and vertical axis = measured energy level (power). How would the plot look like ? Can you come up with an equation to represent the graph ?\n\nTest B) Now let's try a little bit different type of measurement. This time, draw a circle with radius d with the transmitter antenna at the center. and then put several antenna along the circumference and measure the received power at each antenna and plot the value with horizontal axis = location of receiver antenna and vertical axis = measured energy level (power). How would the\nplot look like ?\n\nTest C) Now let's think about two test environment. In one setup there is no obstacles between the reciever and transmitter antenna (Let's call this as 'Setup A'). In the other setup, there are a lot of obstacles (like building, tree, houses, mountain etc) between the transmitter antenna and reciever antenna (Let's call this as 'Setup B'). Then you do the measurement described in Test\nB) for both setup and compare the result. Would you see any difference ? what kind of difference would you see ?\n\nThese three test will be used as a basis for modeling following cases. (Details will come later)\n\nThe first thing we can think of is a kind of ideal case called 'Free Space'. In this case, we assume that there is no obstacles between the transmitter and reciever antenna.\n\nIn this case, the measured power at every reciever antenna at the same distance from the transmitter antenna would be same and the received signal power can be modeled as follows. (Basically this equation is a form of Frris' Transmission Equation )\n\nIf you want to convert this equation to a form which most of RF engineers are more familiar with (dBm scale), you can just apply 10 log( ) on both side and go through following steps. Of course, you don't have to memorize the each of these steps. Just try to understand overall concept and logic of this process.\n\nLife would be much easier if the condition between the transmission antenna and reciever antenna is always as decribed in previous case (Free Space).\n\nIn real life situation, it is highly likely that you would see a lot of obstacles (like building, Tree, mountain etc). If I draw this situation in a little bit simplified way, it would be as follows.\n\nThe path loss at a certain distance can be expressed as follows. Compare this with the free space case. What kind of difference do you see ?\n\nIn case of free space model, once the distance is determined the received power can be determined automatically meaning that if d is fixed(same), you would get the same measured value (recieved power) for every measurement. But in this case, you cannot gurantee the same measured value even though the distance is same. Even though d is same, you would get the different measured value if beta\n(Path Loss Exponent) is different or epsilon (Random Variable) is different.\n\nThen the question would be 'How the Path Loss Exponent and Random Variable is determined ?'. There is no strict theory that can determine these values deterministically. It is usually determined empirically. According to various researches,\n\nIf you apply Log (10 log[ ] more specifically) to both side, you can get a linear equation in dB (dBm) scalse as shown below.\n\nA defining characteristic of the mobile wireless channel is to build up a mathematical model for the variations of the channel strength over time and over frequency. There are mainly two factors influencing the variations of the channel strength as listed below.\n\nAs a starting point, please... please ... please ... read very carefully about the section of Signal Presentation, Impulse Response and Convolution section before you go deeper into this section.\n\nLet's suppose we have a case as shown below. A UE is communicating with a eNodeB and there is a lot of building between the UE and the eNodeB. You may intuitively guess the eNodeB would get the multiple copies of the same signal from UE because the same signal can reach the eNodeB via multiple path as shown below. Let's assume that we have four different path as shown below. There are two\nmajor characteristics of the paths. One is attenuation and the other one is time delay. Of course there would be several additional factors, but these two components would be the largest factors. Let's assume that each of the path has the delay and attenuation as shown below.\n\nHow do we represent a channel using these delay and attenuator factor ? There can be a couple of different ways to represent it, but one of the most common way would be to represent it as an impulse response model. Even though you may not familiar with the term 'impulse response', you may have seen this kind of description if you have any experience of using channel simulators (fader) and\ndealt with fading profile. Following is the graphical representation of impulse response of the four paths in this example and physical meaning of it. I hope this make sense to you.\n\nIf you represent this impulse response into a mathematical form, it become as follows. If you are not familiar with this kind of mathematical representation. Read again the section of Signal Representation. (When you are first learning this way of signal representation.. you may think .. what the hell is delta function\n? Why we need this kind of function ? etc... this is one example why you need to learn those textbook concept).\n\nLet's look into a example that (hopefully) would give you more concrete understanding of these concepts.\n\nLet's suppose that a signal goes through six different path (multipath) as indicated in plot (1). Horizontal axis represents the time delay from the transmission to arrival at the reciever antenna. Vertical axis indicates the amplitude of the received signal. plot(2)~(7) shows the signal going through each path reaching to Rx antenna. If you look at each plots, you would notice that the phase\n(time delay) and amplitude are different from each other. plot (8) shows the summation of all the plots from (2) through (6). This is the signal being sensed by the recieving antenna.\n\nWhat do you observe from the plot (8) (the sum of all the multipath signal) ? You would notice that the amplitude and phase gets different from the transmitted signal, but overall shape of the signal is same as the transmitted signal. It means that no distortion happened by this multipath.\n\nNow let's think of how the received signal is influenced by the multipath with the frequency of the transmitted signal. I created plots for three different frequency (In this case, the amplitude of transmitted signal are same for all frequencies). As you see at plot (8) of each case (w=1,2,5), the amplitude of the total received signal gets different depending on frequency.\n\nNote : This shows the cases of only three different frequencies. Isn't there any way of showing the amplitude of total received signal for all the different frequencies in easier way ? We will look into this shortly.\n\nFollowing is the Octave source code (I think this would work with Matlab as well) for the graphs shown above, try playing the list 'a' and 'tau', get some intuitive understanding on your own.\n\nplot(t,real(exp_iwt)); xlim([0 2]);ylim([-1 1]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[-1 0 1]);\n\nplot(t,imag(exp_iwt)); xlim([0 2]);ylim([-1 1]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[-1 0 1]);\n\nplot(t,real(exp_iwt_sum),'r-'); xlim([0 2]);ylim([-3 3]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[-3 0 3]);\n\nplot(t,imag(exp_iwt_sum),'r-'); xlim([0 2]);ylim([-3 3]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[-3 0 3]);\n\nplot(w,real(Hw)); xlim([0 wmax]);ylim([-1 1]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[-1 0 1]);\n\nplot(w,imag(Hw)); xlim([0 wmax]);ylim([-1 1]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[-1 0 1]);\n\nplot(w,abs(Hw)); xlim([0 wmax]);ylim([0 1]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[0 1]);\n\nplot(w,real(Hw_sum),'r-'); xlim([0 wmax]);ylim([-5 5]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[-5 0 5]);\n\nplot(w,imag(Hw_sum),'r-'); xlim([0 wmax]);ylim([-5 5]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[-5 0 5]);\n\nplot(w,abs(Hw_sum),'r-'); xlim([0 wmax]);ylim([0 5]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[0 5]);\n\nNow we have a channel described in the form of impulse response. Let's suppose that we have a signal x(t) going through the channel. The x(t) will split into multiple pathes in the channel and take the different route and finally recombine at the receiver antenna. What would the signal at the receiving antenna look like ? There is an excellent mathematical tool to give you the answer to this\nquestion. It is a tool called 'Convolution'. If you just take the convolution of channel impulse response and input signal (x(t)), you would take the signal at the receiving antenna.\n\nWhen we specify a Fading Channel profile, we are usually given a table with tap delay and relative power for each tap. You may visualize the table as shown below. Usually those profile table in the specification does not specify statistical information for the tap, but usually some specific statistical profile is associated with each tap. In case of LTE channel profile (Tap Delay Line : TDL), usually each tap is associated with statistical power profile as shown below. Usually the first tap indicates the fading on line of sight path that is modeled in Rician distribution and the remaining taps indicates the fading channel on non line of sight path that is modeled in Rayleigh distribution.\n\nWhen it comes to using this channel profile in fading implementation, I would take this as the impulse response of the fading channel. Then, the modeling of a signal passing through a fading channel can be represented as the convolution of signal and the fading channel as illustrated below.\n\nSound simple ? Yes simple conceptually, but there is a difficulties in reality. It is about how to apply the statistically property associated with each tap.\n\nEach tap is associated with a specific statistical power and doppler profile. It mean that the power for each tap for each steps of convolution changes and the frequency shift for each tap for each steps of convolution changes according to specific statistical profile as illustrated below.\n\nApplying these changing impulse response, the faded signal is generated as illustrated below. (In real implementation, there are various techniques are used to generate this kind of varing channel impulse response. One widely used mathology is to use Jake's model).\n\nIn addition to this delay, gain, PDF, we have to think about the correlations among all the antenna on transmitter and reciever side as follows.\n\nThese correlation is defined in 3GPP as shown below and this correlation matrix should be applied to the Fading model when we use multiple antenna configuration.\n\nDo you see any difference between the matrix shown above (channel matrix) for 2 x 2 MIMO and the correlation matrix as shown below for 2 x 2 case ?\n\nOne obvious difference is size of the matrix. The channel matrix shown above is 2x2 matrix and the correlation matrix for 2 x 2 case shown below is 4x4.\n\nAny idea on how the 2x2 matrix show above is converted to 4 x 4 matrix shown below ?\n\n(The full correlation matrices is obtained by Tensor Product/Kronecker product\nof two antenna correlation matrix)\n\nLet's start with the simplest case and add piece by piece until we reach more realistic (complex) cases.\n\nLet's suppose that you have two Tx antenna and one Rx antenna. If draw this situation as in channel model, you can draw this setup as follows. (Let's call this a Case A)\n\nIn this setup, you have two channel path(channel coefficient) h1 and h2. Now let's think about all the possible relation between these two channel. If you draw all the possible relationships as a diagram, you may represent as follows.\n\nIf you represent these relationship between the two channel path (channel coefficient) in a matrix format, you can represent it as follows. (I would not explain it in detail but you would need to have some intuitive understanding of vector/matrix. This is why you should have taken such a boring linear algebra course in the university. If you are really new to this vector/matrix concept,\nVector/Matrix page on this site). Be careful, you may get confused with 2 x 2 matrix to be used to model 2 x 2 MIMO channel. (At least I was confused a lot at the beginning. I would not talk too much about it, but I strongly recommend you to compare the two matrix and clearly understand the difference between them). Just to give you the conclusion about the difference between the two matrix, the matrix shown\nhere represents the correlation between each channel path(the path the signal flow through) and the matrix shown in channel model represents the correlation between Tx and Rx antenna.\n\nThe 'Beta' value represents the cross correlation between channel coefficient h1 and h2.\n\nNow we have a different case. In this case, you have two Tx antenna and one Rx antenna. If draw this situation as in channel model, you can draw this setup as follows. (Let's call this a Case B)\n\nIf you represent these relationship between the two channel path (channel coefficient) in a diagram, you can represent it as follows.\n\nIf you represent these relationship between the two channel path (channel coefficient) in a matrix format,, you can represent it as follows.The 'Alpha' value represents the cross correlation between channel coefficient h1 and h2.\n\nNow let's look into more complicated case. In this case, you have two transmitter antenna and two reciever antenna. The antenna and channel path can be illustrated as follows. You can think of this as a combination of Case A and Case B described above.\n\nNow if you represents the correlations between each of these channel coefficients, it can be represented as follows.\n\nAs you did in case A and B, if you represents these correlations in vector/matrix format, you would get a big matrix as follows. How did you get the last matrix ?. Actually it came from the matrix for Case A and B described above. If you clearly understood the meaning of Beta and Alpha in Case A and B, you would easily understand how each of the elements in this big matrix can be represented\nas 'Alpha' or 'Beta'.\n\nwhat about the '?' part shown above ? Filling out these '?' is not so straigtforward. If you brow the statical concept (I cannot explain though :)), those parts are the places where the correlation between part of Case A and part of Case B and can be filled as follows.\n\nHow to derive MIMO coeifficient matrix mathematically from Diversity coefficient matrix ?\n\nI have explained how we got 2x2 MIMO correlation matrix from physical perspective and the each elements of 2 x 2 MIMO matrix can be derived from the elements of 2x1 Diversity matrix. I strongly recommend you to try to get familiar with this concept and build your own intuition. But as the number of antenna increases, deriving all the correlation matrix as I described above would not be that\neasy. Fortunately there is a mathematical way of deriving the MIMO correlation matrix from Diversity Correlation matrix. The MIMO correlation matrix can be derived by taking Kronecker product of two Diversity matrix as shown below. (If you are not familar with the concept of Kronecker product, refer to this page)\n\nThe last component I want to show you about Fading is Doppler spread. Doppler spread is caused by the well known phenomenon called 'Doppler Shift' (I would not explain what Doppler shift is. Everybody would learned about this from High school physics and you can easily google out a lot of explanation of this effect).\n\nDoppler spread can be expressed as shown in following function and plot. If you think of 'Doppler spread' as a kind of filter (or a block in a control system model). You can take the following function as a kind of transfer function of the filter.\n\nAs you see, how much a frequency (fc) get spreaded by doppler spread is indicated by fm. If you see another formula below the graph representing fm, you would see fm is determined by the velocity of object (relative velocify between transmitter and reciever) and speed of light and fc(carrier frequency). You know fc is constant (set by standard and assume hardware is good enough to maintain\nthe fc the same). Now the only variable is the speed v. According to this equation, fm and v are in proportional relation, meaning if v gets higher, fm gets larger (the width of the graph gets wider) and if v gets smaller, fm gets smaller (the width of the graph gets narrower).\n\nHow this kind of plot is obtained ? What is the meaning of this plot. Let's think a little bit further into how we get this plot.\n\nLet's assume that a car (e.g, a phone in a car) is moving in horizontal direction and it is receiving a signal with an angle illustrated as in (A). Since the car is moving, the phone in the car would experience doppler shift. Since the UE is getting the signal with an angle, the doppler shift it percieves can be represented as in red arrow in (B).\n\nNow let's extend this situation further to the situation where the UE in the moving car is receiving the signal from all direction as illustrated below. This is the situation where the UE has so many reflectors around it and recieves the multipath signal all around. Then the doppler shift that UE percieves is like red dots marked on the horizontal line. If you plot those red dots in probability distribution function, you will get the red plot as shown below.\n\nNow you may have question. How differently the narrow Doppler spread and wide doppler spread affect on the signal ?\n\nThe simulation result for these two cases (narrow and wide doppler spread) is shown below. The upper track is for narrow doppler spread and the lower track is for wide doppler spread. As you see, you see much frequency energy fluctuation over time in wide Doppler spectrum. I will update the page later about the mathmatical background.\n\nIf you are using a phone in high speed train, the distance between UE and eNB changes very fast. It means both UE and eNB will be under drastic doppler shift.\n\nFor example, let's suppose the train is traveling right into the eNB as illustrated below (the eNB is right on top of the railway). Of course, you don't see this kind of situation in real life. The train will crash into the eNB in this case. However, just suppose this is possible and train can go through a ghost-like eNB. In this case and assume that the speed of the train is constant, the doppler shift will stay constant as well. The only change is the direction of frequency shift changes as the train pass through eNB as illustrated below.\n\nHowever, in realy you don't see any case shown above in real life. In real life, the eNB is located away from the rail way at certain distance.\n\nIn this case, the Doppler Shift changes as the train get closer to, pass by and farther away from the eNB. The doppler shift at a specific time is represented as shown below (36.101 B.3)\n\nWhere does this equation come from ? It turned out to be from hunior high school geometry, but it took me long time to understand this since there is no background information in 3GPP.\n\nThis model is based on the assumption that the eNBs are spaced equaly and the train moves at a constant speed. It is also assumed that the initial location of the train (the location at t = 0) on the railway is at the mid point between two adjacent eNBs as shown below. Dmin is defined as the closest possible distance between UE and eNB and the initial location is specified to be half way between two adjacent eNBs. Then, the distance between the eNB and the train can be derived. If we define the angle theta as shown below, the cos(theta) will become as below.\n\nNow let's look into a snapshot after t seconds. Now the location of the train on the railway and the distance between UE and eNB, and the cos(theta) is derived as shown below. (Just try to derive on your own or just copy it with a pen on a paper, you will understand it clearly).\n\nIf you plot the doppler shift with time as traing travel along the railway, it would be illustrated as shown below.\n\nFollowing is the Matlab code that I wrote based on the equation shown above. In this, I calculated not only frequency shift but also the angle(theta) to figure out the location of the train more easily.\n\nNow let's do some experiment with the code to understand the impact of the parameters. The first experiment is to change the speed of the train keeping all other parameters same. The doppler shift that UE (on the train) will experience can be plotted as shown below. See if this is aligned with your intuitive understanding.\n\nNow let's do another experiement. In this experiement, I changed Dmin keeping all other parameters same. The doppler shift that UE (on the train) will experience can be plotted as shown below. See if this is aligned with your intuitive understanding.\n\nTypical model for Fading channel can be described by a simple diagram as follows. This is very simplified model but fortunately this is almost enough for 3GPP specification for fading test. As you see, a signal comes into the fading block and splits into multiple path. Each path has three components, namely Delay, PDF, Gain component. By changing these parameters in each path,\nyou can construct pretty complicated fading channel.\n\nIn LTE 3GPP specification, typical three types of Fading profiles are defined as follows.\n\nGo through following pages (examples) and try to get some intuitive understanding on your own.\n\n[2] Rayleigh Fading Channels in Mobile Digital Communication Systems.

Now in early 2017 we are at the stage of testing LAA.\n\nTwo of the technology falling into this category is LTE-U and LTE-R. LTE-U has been proposed and start being implemented in the industry for about a year and LTE-R just start being proposed as Integrated wireless railway network to be commercialized .\n\nAs of Jun 2016, I don't see/hear anything about LTE-R.. but I saw the drastic evolution of unlicensed LTE that created several different technologies (names) to the list. It started with LTE-U and evolved to LAA, eLAA and recently we are hearing of new branches like MulteFire and LWA. I don't know how many other technologies are waiting to be newly evolved and which of these technologies\nwill survive to the end.. some of them are now pretty well defined but there are a lot of other features to be defined technically. I will keep following them up and try to write down whatever has been clarified.\n\nFollowings are the brief descriptions for each of these technologies. I will put further details under separate section if more technical details are published. Also, I put many whitepapers and YouTube links under Reference section. I would recommend you to go through those materials when you have free time and use this page as reminder afterwards. (The contents of this table\nis mostly based on Ref [7] )\n\nFollowings are the list of topics that gives you further details of various LTE-Unlicensed technologies.\n\nIn every wireless communication, the communicating parties (transmitter and reciever) need to allocatie a certain amount of resources in both time domain and frequency domain. However, we don't have much control over frequency domain resource allocation because those resources are fixed permanently or semi-statically. So it is usually not in the scope of scheduling. When it comes to scheduling, Time Domain resource allocation tend to be more important.\n\nIn 3GPP based technology (i.e, Cellular Communication Technology like LTE), the time domain scheduling is obvious and determinstic even when there are many devices are in communication because all of the time domain resources determined by the central master (Base Station /Node B/eNode B). However, in 802.11 based technology(i.e LAN, Wireless LAN etc) there is no central controling master in terms of scheduling. In this case, there is always possibility that transmission signal from one device interfere with communication of other devices. To prevent (or at least reduce) this situation, we need a special algorithm for Time Domain Scheduling. Time Domain Scheduling in this case mean 'Determine when to transmit and how long it transmit'.\n\nThen why we need to care of this kind of thing in LTE-Unlicensed technology ? Basically LTE Unlicensed technology (e.g, LTE-U, LAA etc) refer to a technology in which LTE operates in 802.11 frequency region. So LTE need to keep the rule set by 802.11 in order not to prevent the communiction between existing 802.11 devices.\n\nThere are many variations of the time domain scheduling, but the basic idea and logic is same. Basic idea is 'Your transmission should not interfere with communication between others' and the basic logic is 'Before you transmit anything, check if the chennel(medium) is already being used by others'. This logic can be illustrated as follows.\n\nThen you may have some questions as follows : How to check (i.e, how to figure out) whether the channel (medium) is being used by other ? and how long the device need to check before it make any decision ?\n\nIn the effort to answer these questions, you will come across many terms that may confuse you for so long. I tried to list up those confusing words and how these are related to each other in following illustration. If you are new to this area, I would suggest you to understand 'what is CS and ED ?' first and then try to understand how CS / ED is used in higher level technology like CSMA/CD, CSMA/CA, CCS, LBT, CSAT etc. Already feel headache ? :)\n\nCS / ED : CS stands for Carrier Sensing and ED stands for Energy Detection. The fundamental concept is same. The term CS is more frequently used in 802.11 area especially for Wired LAN Area. In this technology, the device measures the energy level in the channel (medium) mostly in the form of voltage and compares the measured voltage with a specified value (threshold value). ED stands for Energy Detection. it is more frequently used in wireless/cellular technology. In this method, the device measures the energy level in the channel (medium) mostly in the form of Power and compares the measured power with a specified value (threshold value)\n\nCSMA/CD or CSMA/CA : As the term CSMA(Carrier Sensing Multiple Access) implies, these are technology of figuring out whether a channel is available or not based on CS method. You don't need to know the details of thechnology under the context of LTE-Unlicensed technology, but if you are really interested in thses method refer to CSMA/CD and CSMA/CA page.\n\nCCA : CCA stands for Clear Channel Assessment. As the word implies, this is a method to figure out the channel is clear (i.e, nobody is using the channel). CCA perform ED(Energy Detection) for a certain period of time and make a decision whether the channel is clear or not. It is a common method being used in 802.11 (WLAN) technology.\n\nHow long CCA perform ED before it make decision ? It depends on higher layer technology (e.g, 802.11 FHSS, 802.11 OFDM, LBT). However, the minimum time span is 18 us sec.\n\nWhat is the threshold energy level to make decision whether the channel is being used by some other device or not ? This also varies depending on power class of the device and reciever antenna gain. However, the base threshold is -70 dBm.\n\nNOTE : Refer to 802.11 specification and ETSI EN 300 328 if you want to get full details and requirement for CCA.\n\nLBT: LBT stands for Listen Before Talk. According to ETSI EN 300 328, LBT is defined as 'mechanism by which an equipment applies clear channel assessment (CCA) before using the channel' (In this document, you can find a couple of variations of LBT depending on different situations). As you see in the terminology itself, 'Listen Before Talk' indicate two major process, the first one is 'Listen' and the second part is 'Talk'. The meaning of 'Talk' is obvious. It means 'Transmit Data'. The tricky part is 'what does it exactly mean by 'Listen''. In more technical definition, 'Listen' mean 'perform CCA(Clear Channel Assessment)'. You can find a more detailed description on LBT in IEEE P802.19-08/0034r0 (The specific value (i.e, transmission time, threshold value may vary depending on application, but I think this explains overal LBT mechanism in easier way than other documents).\n\nCSAT : CSAT stands for Carrier Sensing Adaptive Transmission. CSAT is very similar to CSMA or LBT(Listen Before Talk), the main difference is that CSAT monitors(senses) the medium for much longer duration (around tens of msec to 200 msec) comparing to normal WiFi CSMA, so that it would not interfere not only with WiFi\ndata transmission (QoS traffic) but also with more sporadic transmission like discovery signals (Ref [2]). Unlike other techiques described in this section (defined with focus on 802.11 technology), CSAT is defined by LTE-U Forum with focus on 3GPP technology.\n\nIn LTE, every transmission within a specified spectrum is well managed/scheduled both for downlink and uplink. So Network can figure out exactly when to transmit something and when UE will transmit something.. but in Unlicensed band transmission and reception by the existing WiFi device is not as predictable as in LTE. Basically anybody can transmit in anytime as long as it complies with\nCSMA/CA procedure.\n\nIn this kind of situation, how LTE network can schedule transmission in Unlicensed band ?\n\nOne method is for LTE cell to perform a special channel selection procedure and allocate the channel only when it is clean. \nIn channel selection process, network measures the energy level within the allowed band and use those area in which the energy level is under a certain threshold (e.g, -62 dBm over 20 Mhz BW).\n\nThe Cell performs this kind of channel selection algorithm in on-going mode and if needed it will select more suitable channel and switch to it.\n\nWhat if you (a Cell) fail to find any clean channel at the initial channel selection process ?\n\nIn this case, the cell use another mechanism called CSAT (Carrier-Sensing Adaptive Transmission). Technically, CSAT is very similar to CSMA or LBT(Listen Before Talk), the main difference is that CSAT monitors(senses) the medium for much longer duration (around tens of msec to 200 msec) comparing to normal WiFi CSMA, so that it would not interfere not only with WiFi\ndata transmission (QoS traffic) but also with more sporadic transmission like discovery signals (Ref [2]).\n\nAccording to Reference [5], there seems to be roughly three levels of Coexistence strategy regarding LTE-U. Most of these techniques are already mentioned in previous section, but let me rewrite in a little bit different words.\n\nChannel Selection : This says \"Use WiFi band only when it is not being used (i.e, the band is clean)\". To figure out whether it is being used or not, you have to measure the engergy level of the target band as described above.\n\nTime-domain coexistence techniques : Even when it fail to find any clean channel in channel selection stage, there is still some chance. Even though there is no clean channel at the point of channel selection, there might be some empty slots if you look at the time domain scheduling with relatively high granularity.\nTo find out this kind of time domain opportunity and in order not to make an interference at any time, they are considering several different technology like CSAT, eCSAT, LBT. My personal question were 'do we have to support all these technology everywhere (every devices)?'. This question was answered by Reference [5] as follows.\n\nFor non listen-before-talk (LBT) markets such as the US, South Korea, China and India, CSAT (Carrier Sensing Adaptive Transmission) can be used without changing Rel-10 Carrier Aggregation protocols for co-channel coexistence. For LBT markets such as Europe and Japan, Rel-13 LAA will enable channel sharing with Wi-Fi by performing clear channel assessment (CCA) based channel availability sensing and adapting the transmission duration on a fine timescale, ranging from 1ms-10ms\n\nOpportunistic SCell operation : To me, this sounds like a rule (not a technology). Basically this says \"Use the unlicensed band only when it is really necessary (e.g, in real demand on high throughput or when the primary cell is overloaded). Release the unlicensenced and fall back to anchor carrier when\nthe demand for unlicenced band is not critical.\n\nInterplay of these coexistance technical components are well illustrated as follows in Ref [2].\n\nLTE-U stands for LTE-Unlicensed. This is the first real implementation of the whole LTE-Unlicensed family as far as I remember. Since this is already implemented and tested relatively widely and a lot of details are known, I thought I got enough information to write this subject in a separate page. Refer to LTE-U page for the details.\n\nIn other LTE-Unlincensed technology, LTE borrow only radio spectrum from WLAN and all the transmission/reception technology except radio spectrum purely based on LTE. However, in LWA LTE borrows not only WLAN radio spectrum but also WLAN Access Point for transmitting data. This key difference is illustrated as below. To implement this key difference, we would need to implement many other\ntechnical components. The most important part would be to implmenet special interface between LTE eNB and WLAN AP. Then you may ask.. at which layer the eNB and WLAN will be connected ? It would be quicker to interact if they can get connected at lower layer (e.g, PHY/MAC), but LTE PHY/MAC and WLAN PHY/MAC is completely different.. so hard to make any connection at this layer. So they will use higher layer (specifically PDCP) for this connection. As you know, there is no PDCP layer in WLAN. So connecting at PDCP\nlayer might be a little bit misleading. More accruately speaking, LTE PDCP packet will be encapsulated into WLAN MAC frame.\n\nNow LWA is defined in 3GPP specification and I created a separate page for 3GPP LWA because it will be a long story. Refer to LWA page for the 3GPP details.\n\nAround the end of 2016, I start hearing of implementing this both on UE modem and Network, UE testing equipment side. Now (as of early 2017) I am hearing of testing this feature on real UE. So I decided to create separate page for this. Read LAA page for the details.\n\nPutting very simple way, Multipath Aggregation (more formally Multipath TCP Aggregation : mptcp) is LTE-WLAN aggregation at TCP level as illustrated below. The key component in this architecture would be MP Proxy (Multipath Proxy) and this part is being defined in IETF (Ref [12] )\n\nAs of now (Jan 2015), I don't have any specific information other than Integrated wireless railway network to be commercialized .\n\n[1] LTE-U/LAA, MuLTEfire and Wi-Fi; making best use of unlicensed spectrum (Qualcomm)\n\n[9] Cracking Google Project Fi & LTE/Wi-Fi Aggregation with Qualcomm - Wi-Fi Now Episode 5 (YouTube)\n\n[10] The LTE-U vs. Wi-Fi debate continues empowering carriers with seamless Wi-Fi - Wi-Fi Now Episode 15 (YouYube)\n\n[15] ETSI EN 300 328 Wideband transmission systems;Data transmission equipment operating in the 2,4 GHz ISM band and using wide band modulation techniques;",

The UE calculates the path loss value based on the RSRP then determines UL transmission power based on several parameters configured by gNB. The reference signal for path loss calculation can be SS/PBCH block or CSI-RS. For PUSCH/PUCCH/SRS transmission, multiple parameter sets can be configured and multiple power control adjustment states can be managed for beam switching purpose. For PRACH, only one parameter set is configured. A parameter set consists of target received power and path loss coefficient. The UE can be configured the linkage between an SRS resource and several parameters about reference signal for path loss calculation, a power control parameter set, and a power control adjustment state. When the linkage is configured, the UE determines UL TPC parameters according to an SRS resource index indicated by DCI. In addition, for FR1 LTE-NR dual connectivity including both EN-DC and NR-E-UTRA dual connectivity (NE-DC), power sharing mechanism between RATs was introduced. When UE supports dynamic power sharing, power allocation for NR is dynamically adjusted on condition that the total transmission power never exceeds allowed value. Dynamic power sharing mechanism is shown in Figure 5.5.4.12-1. When UE does not support dynamic power sharing, the total power is semi-statically split for the two RATs by gNB configuration in order not to exceed the total transmission power, otherwise the UE does not expect to transmit in a slot on the NR when a corresponding subframe on the LTE is an UL subframe.",

Most of these main characteristics would lead to some addition / modification of PLDC and MAC frame structure. These detailed changes will be summarized in each corresponding sections. If you are not familiar with WLAN frame structure and basic operations I would recommend you to go through WLAN Frame structure and WLAN protocol page first.\n\nAs in almost every evolution of every communication technology (except IoT), the major motivation of 802.11ac is to achieve much higher throughput than the previous highest throughput technology (802.11n in this case). I am pretty sure that you will see another technology targeted for even higher throughput than 802.11ac (We are already hearing of 802.11ad).\n\nThen what is the technical strategy to achieve this high throughput ? Overall strategy is also same as other technology (If you have seen the evolution process of celluar technology (e.g, WCDMA -> HSPA -> DC HSPA or LTE -> LTE MIMO -> Carrier Aggregation etc), you will easily understand the strategy. Some of the technologies for this evolution can be listed as follows\n\nWith the list in mind, if you try to correlate each of these technologies to each items of specification of 802.11ac, it will be much easier to get the big picture or motivation of those specification.\n\nJust to give you more practical insight on this motivation, I would compare 802.11n (the most advanced technology before 802.11ac) and 802.11ac with the respect t the features/technologies listed above. (NOTE : I got most of these information from Ref [13]. I would recommend you to read through this document at least once if you have time)\n\nNo new technology can be invented overnight. We all understand this. However, we don't want to wait forever until everything is ready all at once. A common practice in this case is to split those requirement/wishlist into multiple chunks and attack them chunk by chunk. In some technology, they call these chunk as 'Stage' (like Stage 1, Stage 2 etc) and in some technology they call them as 'Phase' (e.g, Phase 1, Phase 2 etc). In 802.11ac, they call them as Wave (e.g, Wave 1, Wave 2 etc). 802.11ac has been evolved as two Waves (at least as of now, Aug 2016) as listed below.\n\nIf you have a 802.11ac WLAN Card (device), the first thing you have to do is to figure out the Access Point (AP) around the device support 802.11ac. (Actually you don't need to figure out this, your WLAN device will figure out :).\n\nThen how your WLAN device will figure out whether the AP support 802.11ac or not ? It is by decoding the special information signal from the AP called Beacon. If your AP support 802.11ac, it will broadcast Beancon signal containing following information.\n\nFollowing Beacon Signal is the one from a WLAN Test equipment, Anritsu MT8862. Anritsu kindly provided me a full sample log starting from Beacon through user data and it will be a great resource for my study. I will sharing more as I learn more from the log. You can see the test setup on how this log is captured.\n\nIt may look simple two lines of information, but it will contain a lot of details of the 802.11ac capability that the AP supports. Following is the full decoded information.\n\n.... .... .... .... .... .... .... ..10 = Maximum MPDU Length: 11 454 (0x00000002)\n\n.... .... .... .... .... .... .... 00.. = Supported Channel Width Set: Neither 160MHz\n\n.... .... .... .... .... .... .0.. .... = Short GI for 160MHz and 80+80MHz: Not supported\n\n.... .... .... .... 000. .... .... .... = Compressed Steering Number of Beamformer Antennas\n\n.... .... .... .000 .... .... .... .... = Number of Sounding Dimensions: 1 (0x00000000)\n\n.... .... .0.. .... .... .... .... .... = +HTC-VHT Capable (VHT variant HT Control field):\n\n.... ..11 1... .... .... .... .... .... = Max A-MPDU Length: 1 048 575 (0x00000007)\n\n.... 00.. .... .... .... .... .... .... = VHT Link Adaptation: No Feedback (0x00000000)\n\n...0 .... .... .... .... .... .... .... = Rx Antenna Pattern Consistency: Not supported\n\n..0. .... .... .... .... .... .... .... = Tx Antenna Pattern Consistency: Not supported\n\n...0 0000 0000 0000 = Rx Highest Long GI Data Rate (in Mb/s, 0 = subfield not in use):\n\n...0 0000 0000 0000 = Tx Highest Long GI Data Rate (in Mb/s, 0 = subfield not in use):\n\nCommunication is the exchange of information between two or more parties. The previous section showed how the device can figure out the 802.11ac capability of AP. Then you would ask how the AP can figure out 802.11ac capability of the device. The AP can figure out the device capability from [Probe Request] message from the device as shown below.\n\n.... .... .... .... .... .... .... ..0. = Receive Staggered Sounding: Not supported\n\n.... .... .... .... .00. .... .... .... = Receiver can return explicit uncompressed\n\n...0 0... .... .... .... .... .... .... = Maximum number of space time streams for\n\n.... .... .... .... .... .... .... ..10 = Maximum MPDU Length: 11 454 (0x00000002)\n\n.... .... .... .... 010. .... .... .... = Compressed Steering Number of Beamformer\n\n.... .... .0.. .... .... .... .... .... = +HTC-VHT Capable (VHT variant HT Control\n\n.... ..11 1... .... .... .... .... .... = Max A-MPDU Length:1 048 575 (0x00000007)\n\n...1 .... .... .... .... .... .... .... = Rx Antenna Pattern Consistency:Supported\n\n..1. .... .... .... .... .... .... .... = Tx Antenna Pattern Consistency:Supported\n\nOne of the most important keywords in 802.11ac would VHT. VHT stands for Very High Throughput. You would not need any additional explanation on what this means. The meaning is obvious and self-explanatory.\n\nThe question is how to achieve VHT and what kind of new frames and protocols are introduced to implement this.\n\nIn wireshark log, you may see this framing information from Radiotap Header as shown below.\n\n802.11ac support various types of bandwidth combination like 20 Mhz, 80 Mhz, 160 Mhz. Then the question would 'how do they allocate the bandwidth ?'. Statically or Dynamically ?\n\nStatic allocation means that Transmitter (Initiator) and Reciever(Responder) negotiate and determines the bandwidth during early stage of connection setup and keep it same until the end of communication (a session).\n\nDynamic allocation means that Transmitter and Reciever SOMEHOW negotiate/determine the bandwidth in very short interval even during a single session.\n\n802.11ac picked up the dynamic allocation approach. It allows the change of the bandwidth at every transmission.\n\nThen the question is 'HOW ?'. What kind of negotiation they use to determine/agree upon the bandwidth between Transmitter and Reciever ?\n\nBasic Idea is simple. As you see in Data Transmission in Detail section, basic channel acquisition process for all 802.11 is based on RTS/CTS mechanism. 802.11ac use the same mechanism to determine the avaiable bandwidth dynamically. The idea is to split the whole possible 802.11ac band into multiple blocks of basic segments (e.g, 20 Mhz, 40 Mhz, 80 Mhz etc) and perform the multiple RTS/CTS simulateneously across the multiple frequency block. (It is very similary for Carrier Aggregation in LTE). First, the initiator sends multiple RTS accross the multiple frequency block and wait for CTS. If the initiator recieves CTS accross the all the blocks, it can use all the frequency blocks (very wide aggregated bandwidth). If the initiator recieves only a few CTS for the all transmitted RTS, it uses the smaller bandwidth for which CTS is recieved. (Refer to Ref [9] for the details).\n\nLet me give you a couple of examples with illustration on how Dynamic Bandwidth goes. Here goes only two cases but there can be much more variations on this.\n\nThis is the case where there is no interference between Node A(initiator) and Node B(recipient) and the full bandwith is avaiable for both nodes. Of course, these nodes does not know anything about the bandwidth availability before it completes step 3. Step 0 : Right before Step 1, it is assumed that Node A split the whole 80 Mhz section into 4 contiguous 20 Mhz block and performed carrier sensing for each of these 20 Mhz block. And it is assumed that all of these 20 Mhz block turned out to be available. Step 1 : Node A wait for a certain time period called DIFS(DCF Inter Frame Space), assuming that the scheduling is done in DCF. Step 2 : Node A transmit RTS for each of 20 Mhz block to Node B using 802.11a frame and it is assumed that all of these RTS reached Node B successfully. Step 3 : (Assuming that Node B detected RTS for all of 20 Mhz blocks) Node B transmit CTS using 802.11a frame for every 20 Mhz subblocks. Step 4 : (Assuming that Node A detected CTS for all of 20 Mhz blocks) Node A assumes that all 80Mhz BW is clear/no-interference and transmit the data in 802.11ac mode utilizing the full 80 Mhz. Step 5 : (Assuming that Node B received and decoded the whole data) Node B sends Ack for every 20 Mhz blocks (40 Mhz in total).\n\nThis is the case where there is some interference in some spectrum blocks within the 80 Mhz block on Node B(recipient). Of course, these nodes does not know anything about the bandwidth availability before it completes step 3. Step 0 : Right before Step 1, it is assumed that Node A split the whole 80 Mhz section into 4 contiguous 20 Mhz block and performed carrier sensing for each of these 20 Mhz block. And it is assumed that all of these 20 Mhz block turned out to be available. Step 1 : Node A wait for a certain time period called DIFS(DCF Inter Frame Space), assuming that the scheduling is done in DCF. Step 2 : Node A transmit RTS for each of 20 Mhz block to Node B using 802.11a frame. Step 3 : (In various reason, e.g, Node B failed to receive RTS due to interference or Medium is busy based on carrier sensing ) Node B transmit CTS using 802.11a frame for only two consecutive 20 Mhz blocks. Step 4 : (Assuming that Node A detected CTS for the two 20 Mhz blocks) Node A assumes that only 40Mhz BW is clear/no-interference and transmit the data in 802.11ac mode utilizing the 40 Mhz. Step 5 : (Assuming that Node B received and decoded the whole data) Node B sends Ack for the two 20 Mhz blocks (40 Mhz in total).\n\nIn 802.11ac, Following new Frame Types are added to the existing type. Most of New Frametype is for impelementing Channel Measurement and Report to perform MU-MIMO Beamforming.\n\nThis frame is used for BeamFormer (AP) to initiate Channel Measurement Process. (Refer to 802.11ac 8.3.1.20 VHT NDP Announcement frame format for the details)\n\nIt indicates the number of columns, Nc, in the Compressed Beamforming Feedback Matrix\n\nThis frame is used for BeamFormee (user) to report channel measurement result (Refer to 802.11ac 8.5.23.2 VHT Compressed Beamforming frame format for the details)\n\nTo perform proper beamforming for specific devices, it is crucial to figure out accurate channel condition between BeamFormer and BeanFormee. To figure out the channel condition, BeamFormer and BeamFormee performs a specific sequence of calibration process and this process is called Channel Measurement or Sounding process. It goes as follows.\n\nRefer to 802.11ac 9.31.5.2 Rules for VHT sounding protocol sequences, Figure 9-41a and Figure 9-41a for the details.\n\nNOTE : The fundamental purpose of this complicated process is to figure out the charateristics (nature) of radio channel between the Access Point and Devices. This is also called 'Channel Sounding'. During this process, no user data is conveyed. It means this process can be a kind of overhead (throughput degradation factor). If AP can best optimize the communication by extracting the most suitable BeamForming parameters from this process, this process can give a overall throughput gain. However, if AP failed to get the best BeamForming parameters from this process, this would just create unncessary overhead.\n\nMU-MIMO stands for Multi User MIMO and this is adopted only in 802.11ac (not in 802.11n and lower). When we say MIMO(Multi Input Multi Output), it normally mean SU-MIMO(Single User MIMO), which is a MIMO targeted to only one device(user). On the contrary, MU-MIMO is the MIMO targeted to multiple user simulateneously. It mean that in MU-MIMO the transmitter (Access Point) can transmite the multiple stream of data targeted to multiple user.\n\nIt sounds fancy, right ? However, the implementation of this technology would not be as easy as it sound and real performance would not be as good as expected. Probably it would need to go through a long way of evolution. Let's think of some of the challenges and possible issues related to MU-MIMO\n\nPutting aside the practical feasibility of this MU-MIMO, the specification is done. In most case of technology (even though it is not all the case), once the specification is issued the technology continues to evolve and get better and better.\n\n802.11ac MU-MIMO Beamforming is expressed in a mathematical expression as follows (this is based on 802.11ac 22.3.11 SU-MIMO and DL-MU-MIMO Beamforming)\n\nWhenever a new version of any technology comes out, one of the most concerning thing is compatibility. Can this new stuff work with all of those old stuffs out there already ? You would have the same questions about 802.11ac. Is 802.11ac compatitle with the existing (previous) techology (e.g, 802.11a and 802.11n) ? The answer is Yes. 802.11ac is designed from beginning to be compatible with 802.11a / n both for Access point and devices.\n\n[12] How to validate the WI-FI Information within Wireshark Part I: Determining the WLAN capabilities",

    "context": "https://www.sharetechnote.com/html/Communication_Linearity.html\n\nComm. Tech.: Linearity\n\nOne of the most important assumption for most of communication theory is that the system is LTI (Linear Time Invarient). So it is very important to understand the concept of LTI before you start getting deeper into communication technology. In this page, I will explain about what 'Linear' (Linearity) means and why it is important and in another page I will explain about 'Time Invarience'.\n\nWhat does Linearity means ? you may think any function that can be expressed as a straight line in a coordinate system is linear. But it is not true. Not all straight line in the coordinate system is linear. For a function (system) to be a linear, it has to meet a criteria called 'principle of superposision'.\n\nLet's assum that you have a function f(x) as a straight line starting starting from the origin (0,0) of the coordinate system.\n\nNow look at the upper graph on left side first. If you plug a value 'a' (in thick blue line)' into the function. yoe will get the output of the function as f(a) (in thick red line).\n\nNow look at the bottom graph on left side first. If you plug a value 'b' (in thick green line)' into the function. yoe will get the output of the function as f(b) (in thick black line).\n\nNow let's take the graph of f(a+b). It is the graph on the right side. Just by looking, you would notice that f(a+b) is same as f(a) + f(b). Therefore, this graph(function, system) is linear.\n\nIs this a linear function ? Let's see if this meets the principle of superposition, i.e, f(a+b) = f(a) + f(b). Let's assume a = 3, b = 2.\n\nDoes this satisfy the principle of superposition ? (In strict mathematics, you cannot prove it with just single. You have to prove this is true for any numbers... try all different values as 'a' and 'b' and check if it still works -:). But intuitively, you can say \"Yes, it satisfy the principle of superposition, so this function is a linear'.\n\nIf the explanation above is not clear to you, it would be clearer if you look at an example in which f(a+b) is not the same as f(a)+f(b). Following is an example.\n\nLook at the function graph in this case. It is not the straight line, it is a path kinked at one point (or you can draw a curved line as the function).\n\nNow look at the upper graph on left side first. If you plug a value 'a' (in thick blue line)' into the function. you will get the output of the function as f(a) (in thick red line).\n\nNow look at the bottom graph on left side first. If you plug a value 'b' (in thick green line)' into the function. yoe will get the output of the function as f(b) (in thick black line).\n\nNow let's take the graph of f(a+b). It is the graph on the right side. Just by looking, you would notice that f(a+b) is not same as f(a) + f(b). Therefore, this graph(function, system) is not linear.\n\nIs this a linear function ? Let's see if this meets the principle of superposition, i.e, f(a+b) = f(a) + f(b). Let's assume a = 3, b = 2.\n\nIs f(a+b) = f(a) + f(b) ? No, it is because f(3+2) is 25 but f(3) + f(2) = 9 + 4 = 13.\n\nI hope you have the general concept of linearity by now. But I think practically more important question would be \"Why the Linearity is so important ?\", \"Why we have to care about linearity ?\".\n\nIt is important because in linear system, once you have an output for any specific input, you can figure out all other outputs without doing real test.\n\nFor example, let's assume that you have a linear system and you know the outout of the system when you put '1' as an input is '2', i.e f(1) = 2 and somebody ask you to get the output when the input is 5, meaning that he wants to get 'f(5)'. In this case, by the principle of superposition you can rewrite the f(5) as follows.\n\nSince you already know the value of f(1) = 2, you can get f(5) as follows without doing any test.\n\nYou would see later that we usually indentify the characteristics of any linear system by what we call 'impulse response'. Once you have the impulse response of the system, you can figure out the output of the system for any input by using the impulse response. This is possible only when the system is Linear.",

This service component controls the transfer of the trace records from the NEFs to the OSF. The conceptual model is illustrated in figure 5, which employs both the event report function (CCITT X.734 [14]) and the log control function (CCITT X.735 [15]).\n\nThe trace control function collects traceable events within the NEF and formats them into trace records. These trace records may be stored locally within the NEF filestore or transferred to the OSF in the form of event reports. This is controlled by means of the \"priority\" indicator, which is a part of the trace type. If the \"priority\" indicator is not set then the trace records shall stored within the local filestore and subsequently transferred to the OSF in bulk via FTAM.\n\nIf a trace is activated with the \"priority\" indicator set then the trace records shall be sent to the OSF either direct by the trace control function or through Event Forwarding Discriminators (EFDs).\n\nIf EFDs are used then all trace records are offered to the EFDs. The EFDs determine which of the records are to be transmitted to the OSF in the form of event reports and the Operation System Id field in the header is ignored. The EDFs have complex filter constructs, which allow the operator to define the criteria for destinations and filters.\n\nIf EFDs are not used then all priority records are forwarded to the OSF whose address is given in the Operation System Id field. The NEF is required to supply additional information to provide the OS management application entity title.\n\nFinally, the trace records may also be stored in the form of log entries within the log of the NEF. It is up to the operator to decide if the log function is needed in parallel with the event reporting and file store. Once stored, the log records may be individually accessed by the OSF via the appropriate object management functions. Care should be taken of filter criteria for log records to avoid unnecessary overheads.\n\nThis service component contains the following groups of TMN management functions:\n\n9.2\tTransfer of Records\n\n9.2.1\tBulk record transfer\n\nThis group of TMN functions is concerned with the bulk transfer of trace records from the NEF record filestore to the OSF.\n\nThe trace records shall be transferred from the NEF to the OSF by the use of FTAM services. For further details of the use of FTAM see GSM 12.01 [8].\n\nIn addition to the simple file transfer services provided by FTAM, peertopeer application process communication may also be supported. The use of CMIS services for the uploading of files from the NEF to the OSF is specified in the GSM 12.00 [7].\n\nWhen the procedure defined in GSM 12.00 [7] and GSM 12.01 [8] are used to transfer the trace records, the file type shall be traceRecords and the format of the file is given by the type TraceFileFormat.\n\n9.2.2\tLog control\n\nThis function permits the trace record to be stored and retrieved from logs within the NEF. The logging of these records is performed in accordance with the log control function specified in CCITT X.735 [15] and no additional management functions are required.\n\n9.2.3\tLog access\n\nThis TMN function controls the access to the log described above. Each log defined may contain one or more log entries. Each log entry contains a single trace record.\n\nFor further details concerning the use of logs, see CCITT X.735 [15].\n\nThe following system management functions are required:\n\n9.2.4\tEvent Reporting\n\n9.2.4.1\tEvent Forwarding Discriminators\n\nFor shortterm recording of tracing events and for more complicated filter conditions the event forwarding discriminator construct defined in CCITT X.734 [14] and CCITT X.721 [13] can be employed. The event forwarding discriminator construct is extremely flexible permitting the combination of a number of fields and logical operations with a wide variety of scheduling options. The EFD also controls the destinations to which the event reports are sent. Several such filters may be defined and scheduled for operation at different times and for different time periods.\n\nThe following system management functions are required:\n\n9.2.4.2\tDirect Transfer by Trace Control Function\n\nThis function permits the NEF to transmit trace records direct to the OSF. In general the trace record shall be sent on completion of the call or the traceable event. This function is controlled by means of the \"priority\" indicator, which is contained in the trace type. If the priority indicator is not set, then the trace records shall be stored on file within the NE filestore. These records may be subsequently collected via bulk record transfer as described in subclause 9.2.1. If the trace type specified on activation includes the \"priority\" indicator then all of the records shall be sent via trace reports to the OSF specified by the operation system id.\n\nThe following system management functions are required:",

    "context": "8.2.1\tBasic Handover procedure requiring a circuit connection between MSCA and 3G_MSCB\n\nThe procedure used for successful Inter-3G_MSC Handover from GSM to UMTS is shown in figure 24. Initiation of the GSM to UMTS handover procedure is described in clause 5. The procedure described in this clause makes use of messages from the 3GPP TS 48.008, 3GPP TS 25.413 and of the transport mechanism from the Mobile Application Part (MAP) (3GPP TS 29.002). After an Inter-3G_MSC handover further Intra-3G_MSC handovers may occur on 3G_MSCB, these handovers will follow the procedures specified in the previous clauses.\nThe GSM to UMTS handover is initiated as described in subclause 6.2.2. (This is represented by A-HO-REQUIRED in figure 24). Upon receipt of the A-HO-REQUIRED from BSS-A, MSCA shall send a MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request to 3G_MSCB including a complete A-HO-REQUEST message.\nThe MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request shall carry in the AHO-REQUEST all information needed by 3G_MSCB for allocating radio resources in RNS-B, see 3GPP TS 48.008.\n\nThe MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request shall also carry the identity of the target RNS to which the call is to be handed over, see 3GPP TS 29.002.\nIf MSC-A supports inter-system handover to a CSG cell and BSS-A includes a CSG ID for the target cell in the A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message, then MSC-A shall check the CSG membership of the UE for the target cell as described in subclause 4.1.1 before generating the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request. If the UE fails the CSG membership check and the target cell is a CSG cell, MSC-A shall send an A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED-REJECT to BSS-A.\nIf MSC-A supports inter-system handover to a CSG cell, the target cell belongs to the registered PLMN or an equivalent PLMN, and the HLR or the CSS provided CSG subscription data, MSC-A shall include the CSG subscription data for the registered PLMN and, if available, for the equivalent PLMNs in the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request.\n\n3G_MSCB will return the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER response after having retrieved a Handover Number from its associated VLR (exchange of the messages MAP-allocate-handover-number request and MAP-send-handover-report request). The Handover Number shall be used for routing the connection of the call from MSCA to 3G_MSCB.\nFor speech calls, if 3G_MSC-B supports the selection of codec based on the Iu-Supported Codecs List, 3G_MSCB shall select an Iu Selected codec from the Iu Supported Codecs List, generate associated RAB parameters and connect a transcoder. If the Iu Supported Codecs List was not received or 3G_MSC-B does not support the selection of codec based on the Iu-Supported Codecs List, 3G_MSCB shall select the appropriate default speech codec.\nFor handover to UTRAN Iu mode, 3G_MSC-B shall also generate a NAS Synch Indicator for the Iu-RELOCATION-REQUEST message. If the Iu Supported Codecs List was received by 3G_MSC-B and 3G_MSC-B supports the selection of codec based on the Iu-Supported Codecs List, then the Iu Selected codec shall be indicated in the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER response, sent from 3G_MSCB to MSCA.\n\nIf A over IP is supported by MSC-A, then for speech calls MSC-A may include the AoIP-Supported Codecs List (Anchor) in the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request to be used by 3G_MSC-B for subsequent intra-MSC-B intersystem handover to A over IP capable BSC. For a detailed description of the handling of this codec list by MSCA and 3G_MSC-B see 3GPP TS 23.153.\nIf radio resources are available in RNS-B the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER response will contain the complete A-HO-REQUEST-ACK message generated from the Iu-RELOCATION-REQUEST-ACK received from RNS-B, containing the radio resources definition to be sent by BSS-A to the UE/MS. If the radio resource allocation is not possible, the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER response containing an A-HO-FAILURE will be sent to MSCA. 3G_MSCB will do the same if a fault is detected on the identity of the cell where the call has to be handed over. 3G_MSCB simply reports the events related to the dialogue. It is up to MSCA to decide the action to perform if it receives negative responses or the operation fails due to the expiry of the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER timer.\n\nIf an error related to the TCAP dialogue or to the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request is returned from 3G_MSCB, this will be indicated to MSCA and MSCA will terminate the handover attempt. MSCA shall reject the handover attempt towards BSS-A. The existing connection to the UE/MS shall not be cleared.\nWhen the A-HO-REQUEST-ACK has been received, MSCA shall establish a circuit between MSCA and 3G_MSCB by signalling procedures supported by the network. In figure 24 this is illustrated by the messages IAM (Initial Address Message) and ACM (Address Complete Message) of Signalling System no 7. 3G_MSCB awaits the capturing of the UE/MS (subclause 6.2.2) on the radio path when the ACM is sent and MSCA initiates the handover execution when ACM is received (illustrated by the A-HO-COMMAND and described in subclause 6.2.2).\n\nIf the BSS-A was connected via an A interface over IP and no transcoding performed in the BSS then MSC-A shall remove the transcoder between the MSC and the other party.\n3G_MSCB transfers to MSCA the acknowledgement received from the correct UE/MS (A-HO-DETECT/A-HO-COMPLETE). The Iu-RELOCATION-DETECT, if received, is converted to A-HO-DETECT and transferred to MSCA using the MAP-PROCESS-ACCESS-SIGNALLING request. The Iu-RELOCATION-COMPLETE, when received from the correct UE/MS, is converted to A-HO-COMPLETE and included in the MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL request and sent back to MSCA. The circuit is through-connected in MSCA when the A-HO-DETECT or the AHOCOMPLETE is received from 3G_MSCB. The old radio channel is released when the A-HO-COMPLETE message is received from 3G_MSCB. The sending of the MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL request starts the MAP supervision timer for the MAP dialogue between MSCA and 3G_MSCB. When the MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL request including the A-HO-COMPLETE message is received in MSCA the resources in BSS-A shall be cleared.\n\nIn order not to conflict with the PSTN/ISDN signalling system(s) used between MSCA and 3G_MSCB, 3G_MSCB must generate an answer signal when Iu-RELOCATION-DETECT/COMPLETE is received.\n3G_MSCB shall release the Handover Number when the circuit between MSCA and 3G_MSCB has been established.\nIf the circuit between MSCA and 3G_MSCB cannot be established (e.g. an unsuccessful backward message is received instead of ACM). MSCA terminates the inter3G_MSC handover attempt by sending an appropriate MAP message, for example an ABORT.\nMSCA shall retain overall call control until the call is cleared by the fixed subscriber or the UE/MS and there is no further call control functions to be performed (e.g. servicing waiting calls, echo cancellers).\nWhen MSCA clears the call to the UE/MS it also clears the call control functions in MSCA and sends the MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL response to release the MAP resources in 3G_MSCB.\n\nMSCA may terminate the procedure at any time by sending an appropriate MAP message to 3G_MSCB. If establishment of the circuit between MSCA and 3G_MSCB has been initiated, the circuit must also be cleared.\nThe GSM to UMTS handover will be aborted by MSCA if it detects clearing or interruption of the radio path before the call has been established on 3G_MSCB.",

In order to achieve wider bandwidth, carrier aggregation (CA) of up to 16 NR carriers is further supported. Both CA within a frequency band (intra-band CA) and CA across frequency bands (inter-band CA) are supported. For the case of inter-band CA, CA with different numerologies, e.g., CA between NR carrier in FR1 and NR carrier in FR2, is also supported.\n\nNR newly defines the concept of bandwidth part (BWP). A UE can be configured with up to four BWPs per NR carrier for DL and UL, respectively. Each BWP has its own parameters including bandwidth and numerology. The bandwidth of the BWP is configured for each UE according to the UE capability on supported maximum bandwidth, and hence multiple UEs having different bandwidth capabilities can be served in a single wideband NR carrier. Also, multiple BWPs with different numerologies can be multiplexed within a single NR carrier to support different types of services. The bandwidth of the BWP can be narrower than the supported maximum bandwidth for the UE so that UE power saving is achieved.

For example, there can be one network slice for IoT, another one for supporting \"classic\" UEs and another one for V2X. More generally, there can be different requirements on functionality (e.g., priority, policy control), differences in performance requirements (e.g., latency, mobility and data rates), or they can serve only specific types of users (e.g., MPS users, Public Safety users, corporate customers, roamers, or hosting an MVNO). The different slices can be used simultaneously.\n\nEnd-to-end Network slicing is a major characteristic of the 5G System. It is supported by every deployed PLMN to the extent necessary to interoperate with other PLMNs, e.g. the IoT slice from operator A can interconnect directly with the IoT slice of operator B. Based on business scenario, the operator can decide how many network slices to deploy and what functions/features to share across multiple slices.\n\nThe characteristics of each slice are defined in terms of QoS, bit rate, latency, etc. For a given slice, these characteristics are either predefined in the 3GPP Standard or are operator-defined. There are three types of predefined slices: type 1 is dedicated to the support of eMBB, type 2 is for URLLC and type 3 is for MIoT support. These predefinitions allow inter-PLMN operation with reduced coordination effort between operators. As for the operator-defined slices, they enable more differentiation among network slices.\n\nA dedicated NF is introduced for slices handling: the \"Network Slice Selection Function\" (NSSF), which enables the selection of the appropriate slice(s). The UEs may use multiple Network Slices simultaneously. The Network Slice Selection policies in the UE links applications to Network slices.\n\nNetwork slicing also supports roaming scenarios. Finally, Network Slicing Interworking with EPS (with or without 4G's Dedicated Core Networks Selection Mechanism (e)DECOR) is possible.",

That is, LTE-NB Uplink is also using SC-FDMA. But there is some differences between LTE-NB and legacy LTE in terms of structure of uplink signal. I mean there is slight differences in terms of Uplink resource grid (frame structure). In addition, there is a new unit called RU(Resource Unit) that exisits in LTE-NB but not used in legacy LTE.\n\nUplink Frame Structure of LTE-NB can be summarized in the following three tables. If you can interpret these tables into a correct graphical format, you already understand all the details of Uplink frame structure. Most of technical materials (or white papers) write several pages in words based on these small tables.\n\nThe first thing you might have noticed from the tables above would be that there are two different types of sub-carrier spacing in LTE-NB. One is 15 Khz (this is same as in legacy LTE) and the other one is 3.75 Khz.\n\nLet's draw a resource grid in a frame based on 15 Khz subcarrier spacing. In this case, you can easily calculate that you can put 12 sub carriers within 180 Khz BW(LTE-NB System Bandwidth). And in 36.211-10.1.2.1, you see there are 20 slots within a radio frame. If you translate these into a graphical format, it would become as follows. Basically this is same as in legacy LTE uplink resource grid.\n\nNow let's draw a resource grid in a frame based on 3.75 Khz subcarrier spacing. In this case, you can easily figure out that you can put 48 sub carriers within 180 Khz BW(LTE-NB System Bandwidth). And in 36.211-10.1.2.1, you see there are 5 slots within a radio frame. If you translate these into a graphical format, it would become as follows.\n\nComparing 3.75 Khz resource grid and 15 Khz resource grid, you would notice followings\n\nA kind of new concept in LTE-NB UL resource assignment comparing to legacy LTE, LTE-NB introduce a new resource unit called RU(Resource Unit) as a basic unit for PUSCH allocation. This unit can take several different types of configurations as defined in the table shown below.\n\nNow let's try to translate each item of this table into a graphical form (resource grid).\n\nLet's take the item highlighed in red show below. It is for NPUSCH format 1, Sub Carrier Spacing = 15 Khz, the number of sub carrier in one RU is 1 and the number of slots within the RU is 16.

This means that MSCB keeps control of the radio resources connection and release towards BSS-B. MSCB will do some processing on the BSSMAP information received on the E-interface or A-interface whereas it will relay the DTAP information transparently between Ainterface and E-interface. MSCA initiates and drives a subset of BSSMAP procedures towards MSCB, while MSCB controls them towards its BSSs to the extent that MSCB is responsible for the connections of its BSSs. The release of the dedicated resources between MSCB and BSS-B is under the responsibility of MSCB and BSSB, and is not directly controlled by MSCA. When clearing is to be performed due to information received from BSS-B, MSCB shall transfer this clearing indication to MSCA, to clear its connection with BSS-B, to terminate the dialogue with MSCA through the Einterface, and to release its circuit connection with MSCA, if any. In the same way, the release of the connection to its BSS-B, is initiated by MSCB, when the dialogue with MSCA ends normally and a release is received from the circuit connection with MSCA, if any, or when the dialogue with the MSCA ends abnormally.\n\nWhen a release is received by MSCB for the circuit connection with MSCA then MSCB shall release the circuit connection.\nIn the Inter-system Inter-MSC handover case, the role of MSCB (MSCB') is only to provide radio resources control within its area. This means that MSCB keeps control of the radio resources connection and release towards BSS-B. MSCB will do some processing on the BSSMAP information received on the E-interface or A-interface whereas it will relay the DTAP information transparently between Ainterface and E-interface. 3G_MSCA initiates and drives a subset of BSSMAP procedures towards MSCB, while MSCB controls them towards its BSSs to the extent that MSCB is responsible for the connections of its BSSs. The release of the dedicated resources between MSCB and BSS-B is under the responsibility of MSCB and BSSB, and is not directly controlled by 3G_MSCA. When clearing is to be performed due to information received from BSS-B, MSCB shall transfer this clearing indication to 3G_MSCA, to clear its connection with BSS-B, to terminate the dialogue with 3G_MSCA through the Einterface, and to release its circuit connection with 3G_MSCA, if any. In the same way, the release of the connection to its BSS-B, is initiated by MSCB, when the dialogue with 3G_MSCA ends normally and a release is received from the circuit connection with MSCA, if any, or when the dialogue with the MSCA ends abnormally.\n\nWhen a release is received by MSCB for the circuit connection with 3G_MSCA then MSCB shall release the circuit connection.\nFor subsequent inter-MSC handover to an area where \"Intra Domain Connection of RAN Nodes to Multiple CN Nodes\" is applied, MSC-B can have multiple target CN nodes for each handover target in a pool-area as specified in 3GPP TS 23.236.\nMSC-B may support subsequent inter-MSC inter-system handover to a CSG cell. If MSC-B supports handover to a CSG cell, the serving BSS is served by MSC-B and provides a CSG ID for the target cell, and the call is not an emergency call, then MSC-B checks the CSG membership of the UE for the target cell using the CSG subscription data provided by the anchor MSC-A or 3G_MSC-A during the basic inter-MSC handover before proceeding with the subsequent handover procedure. If there is no subscription data for this CSG ID or the CSG subscription for the CSG ID has expired, MSC-B considers the membership check as failed.\n\nFor subsequent handover of an emergency call to a CSG cell, MSC-B shall skip the CSG membership check and proceed with the handover procedure.\nFor subsequent inter-PLMN handover to a CSG cell, if the anchor MSC-A or 3G_MSC-A provided a CSG ID list for the target PLMN during the basic inter-MSC handover, MSC-B shall validate the CSG membership of the UE in the target CSG cell using the CSG ID list for the target PLMN.\nIf the anchor MSC-A or 3G_MSC-A provided only a CSG ID list for the PLMN of MSC-B, then based on operator's configuration the MSC-B may allow the handover by validating the CSG membership of the UE in the target CSG cell using this CSG ID list. Otherwise, MSC-B shall reject the handover due to no CSG subscription information of the target PLMN-ID available.\n4.2.2\tFunctional composition of MSCB and its interfaces for handover\n\nThe functional composition of an MSC acting as MSCB is essentially the same as that of MSCA. However, there are some differences. The functional units are as follows (see figure 3).\nSignalling functions:\nSwitching functions:",

What confuse you would about 'how one technology differs from other technologies ?' or 'which technology I have to chose for my application or use model ?'\n\nThe simple answer to the question \"Which technology do I have to pick for my application or my use model ?\" is \"It depends on the nature of your application\".\n\nI know.. you would not take this as an answer. You would ask for more specific answers.\n\nIf you want to get more specific answers, you would have specific answers to a lot of specific questions as listed below. (This list would get extended as learn/observe more from various discussions/forums).\n\nI would not put my comments on each of the questions for now.. just to give you some time for you to think.. (good excuse for my laziness :)).\n\nThis is basically asking about the data rate of the end node in your IoT system. Is it collecting a simple data like Temperature, Humidity which takes up only several bytes at a time of transmission. Normally this kind of IoT device should be very low cost. It is less likely to let this kind of device to use relatively expensive network (like cellular network).\n\nThis is asking 'Are you going to use a simple sensors (like temperature, humidity) ?' or some other devices which requires a relatively large packet transmission/reception or which requires very high level data security.\n\nThis would be highly related to Q1. Usually the type of data to be collected and transmitted would determine the necessary data rate, but there might be some exceptions. For example, if you need very sophisticated data security and add a lot of additional portions to the original data to implement the security, the data rate that you would need would get much higher. Another exception can be the case where you want to upgrade/reconfigure your end-node remotely. Of course, this would not happen very often but if you really want to do this, the data rate should be pretty high for the end-node to download necessary firmware and configuration information.\n\nQ4. Does your end node device will both transmit and receive data ? or only transmit the data (no recieve) ?\n\nMost of the IoT application is Uplink centeric (transmission only in terms of end-device) and in some extreme case there are some application that is uplink only. It is understandable for most of IoT application to be Uplink dominant but there would be a lot of restriction if it goes with uplink only. For example, you have a very simple end-device (e.g, a temperature sensor) and transmitted it to a Gateway or Basestation. If the device is uplink only (transmission only), the device can only transmit the data and there is no way to verify whther it successfully reached the destination or not. To verify the successful transmission of the data, there should be some mechanism by which the destination (e.g, Gateway) can send Acknowledge message to the device that has sent the data. To do this, the system should allow downlink (i.e, reception in terms of end-device). Also, if you want to apply any form of data security or remote re-configuration or remote update, you need both uplink and downlink.\n\nLet me ask another question before this .. Are you going to use unlicensed band/frequency (i.e ISM band) or a licensed band / frequency (e.g, Cellular) ? If you decided to use ISM band, it is highly likely to use sub Ghz band (i.e, around 900 Mhz) or around 2.4 Ghz frequency. If you decided to use licensed band, it will be determined by which frequency will be allowed in the area where your IoT system will be installed.\n\nIf you selected unlicensed band, you are free to use any of the frequency .. but it is not only you who is free to use the frequency.. there might be a lot of other devices that uses the same frequency which might cause unwanted interference. If you decided to use the licensed frequency, there will be licensing / permission issue.\n\nIf the transmitter and reciever is communicating within the range of couple of meters or tens of meters, you can use many of the existing short range communication like Bluetooth, ZigBee etc. However, if it should extend to several km or tens of km, you have to use those technologies that can cover wide range like LPWAN (e.g, LoRa, SigFox etc) or Cellular technology.\n\nBasically IoT requires a cirtain type of Network structure whether it is small or large (in most case it is not peer to peer communication). Then you would have question on how to form such a network and how much control you want to have over the whole network. Some people would say 'I want to implement only the end Node(e.g, terminal sensor module) and get it connected to an exisiting network that are already established'. In this case, you would consider Cellular based IoT or SigFox. In this option, you would have less work to do but very limitted or no controllability for network. Some people would say 'I want to implement everything from the end node to the network and I want to have full control over the network'. In this case, you may like LoRa type of technology. You would have full controllability, but downside is that there are a lot of works for you to do.\n\nFor example, SKT deployed a Nation wide IoT service in South Korea around the end of 2016 based on LoRa technology. According to Ref [5], they were considering LoRa, SigFox, NB-LTE(and other LTE based IoT). LTE IoT was excluded for other reason, but between LoRa and SigFox, the controllability to Network was one of the factor to select LoRa.\n\nQ10. Do you need any security for the data being transmitted and received ? At which level, if you need ?\n\nI personally think this is pretty important issue since there are many cases where it is not easy to change / upgrade the software of a IoT end node once it is installed or take too much cost to visit every installation points and change software of the device. However, I don't see this issues widely discussed in the industry yet (as of early 2017). Probably they are afraid to bring up the issues that does not have any simple / easy solution. In theory, the smartest solution is to let the end node device itself to download the new software and upgrade it by itself. We have seen this type of software upgrade in cellular phone (smart phone) pretty commonly these days. We may think of utilizing the similar technologies to IoT devices. However, the biggest problem would be the bandwidth. Most of IoT device is designed for low data rate communication, but this kind of wireless software upgrade would take pretty big bandwidth. So if you think of this kind of wireless software upgrade, you would need to choose such a technology to provide big enough bandwidth for wireless woftware upgrade.\n\nQ12. What kind of protocol (phy, mac, application layer protocol) do you want to use ?\n\nThere are many different technologies that claim to be the best for IoT. Some of them would already be available at your time of deployment, but some technologies would be being talked a lot but not available or not mature yet. So if your deployment schedule is very near, you would need to choose a technology that are mature right now.\n\nFor example, SKT deployed a Nation wide IoT service in South Korea around the end of 2016 based on LoRa technology. According to Ref [5], they were considering LoRa, SigFox, NB-LTE(and other LTE based IoT). SigFox were excluded for other reason, but between LoRa and SigFox, LoRa was selected mainly due to availability. LoRa technology was already there when they were planning, but there were still a couple of years to go for LTE based IoT to be mature enough.\n\n[3] NarrowBand IoT Demystified: What are the benefits and why do we need it?

The location information for each MS is stored in functional units called location registers. Functionally, there are two types of location registers:\nSee also 3GPP TS 23.002 where the network architecture is described, and 3GPP TS 23.008 where the data stored in the location registers are described.\nThe action taken by a MS in order to provide location information to the PLMN will be referred to as location updating.\n2.2\tLocation area and MSC area\nThe MSC area is composed of the area covered by all base stations controlled by the MSC. An MSC area may consist of several location areas. A location area is an area in which, after having performed a location update once, MSs may roam without being required to perform subsequent location updates for reason of location change. A location area consists of one or more cells.\n\nFor further details of the network architecture, see 3GPP TS 23.002.\n2.3\tLocation area identification\nThe Location Area Identification (LAI) plan is part of the base station identification plan. The base stations are identified uniquely (see 3GPP TS 23.003).\n2.4\tIMSI detach/attach operation\nThe support of IMSI detach/attach operation is mandatory in MSs. The facility is optional in the fixed infrastructure of the PLMN.\n2.4.1\tExplicit IMSI detach/attach\nExplicit IMSI detach operation is the action taken by an MS to indicate to the PLMN that the station has entered an inactive state (e.g. the station is powered down). Explicit IMSI attach operation is the action taken by an MS to indicate that the station has re-entered an active state (e.g. the station is powered up).\n2.4.2\tImplicit IMSI detach\n\nImplicit IMSI detach operation is the action taken by the VLR to mark an MS as detached when there has been no successful contact between the MS and the network for a time determined by the implicit detach timer. The value of the implicit detach timer is derived from the periodic location updating timer; when the MSC/VLR applies Mobility Management Congestion Control to a MS, the MSC/VLR may need to adjust the Implicit Detach timer as specified in clause 3.7.2. During an established radio contact, the implicit detach timer shall be prevented from triggering implicit detach. At the release of the radio connection, the implicit detach timer shall be reset and restarted. Implicit IMSI detach shall also be performed in the case of a negative response to an IMEI check.\n2.5\tUse of the term mobile station (MS) in the present document\n\nIn order to simplify the text the term Mobile Station (MS) as used in relation to location management refers to the entity where the IMSI is stored, i.e., in card operated MSs the term Mobile Station (MS) refers to the card.\n2.6\tPaging area\nAs an option, and for paging optimization purpose, the VLR may control Paging Areas. A Paging Area (PgA) is composed of up to 5 Location Areas, and the MSC area is composed of several Paging Areas. Paging areas may overlap each other. The Paging Area is stored in the HLR and updated at each paging area change. The Paging Area is sent by the HLR to the VLR at roaming number request and may be used by the MSC/VLR for paging (e.g. when LAI is not known, after MSC/VLR restart) (see 3GPP TS 23.018 [5a]).",

    "context": "7.1\tGeneral\n\nClause 7 contains examples of how the network may group together the elementary procedures (i.e. the procedures defined in clauses 3 to 5) in order to provide normal service.\nThe layer 3 signalling at the radio interface may be divided into so-called structured procedures which consist of specific combinations of elementary procedures. In subclause 7.3, selected examples of structured procedures are described. A structured procedure consists of (not necessarily all) components shown in figure 7.1. These components are characterized by the purpose of their use in structured procedures and their message flow in the following subclauses 7.1.1 to 7.1.7.\n7.1.1\tPaging request\nThe paging procedure is used to locate a mobile station to which a connection shall be established.\nUpon receipt of a PAGING REQUEST message the addressed mobile station initiates the immediate assignment procedure.\n\n7.1.2\tImmediate assignment\nThe immediate assignment procedure is always initiated by the mobile station. It may be triggered by a paging request or by a mobile originating service request.\nThe mobile station sends a CHANNEL REQUEST message on the Random Access Channel. The network responds with an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message which causes the mobile station to seize the indicated dedicated channel.\n7.1.3\tService request and contention resolution\nThe initial service request message (a PAGING RESPONSE, LOCATION UPDATING REQUEST, IMSI DETACH, CM SERVICE REQUEST, or CM RE-ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message) is sent by the mobile station to the network piggy-backed in the L2 SABM frames establishing the main signalling link. Its purpose is:\nContention resolution provides a resolution process when more than one MS try to seize a channel allocated during the immediate assignment procedure (because they happened to use the same random reference at the same time during random access). This is achieved by the network including in a L2 UA frame the same information field as that one received in the L2 SABM frame to which the UA frame responds. By comparing the two information fields the MS can verify whether it was the originator of the L2 establishment, because the service request contains the mobile identity.\n\n7.1.4\tAuthentication\nThe purpose of authentication is to validate the identity provided by the mobile station . It is initiated by the network. The authentication procedure also provides the mobile station with information from which a new ciphering key can be derived. The network decides whether or not to use authentication. This may depend on the context.\n7.1.5\tCiphering mode setting\nCiphering mode setting is initiated by the network. Its purpose is to instruct the mobile station whether or not to use ciphering and which algorithm to use.\nWhere ciphering is used, this procedure synchronizes the start of ciphering at the mobile station and in the network.\n7.1.6\tTransaction phase\nA variety of elementary procedures described in clauses 3 to 5 may be performed during the transaction phase. In this subclause, only the channel mode modify procedure is characterized.\n\n7.1.6.1\tChannel mode modify\nThe channel mode modify procedure may be used when a traffic channel has been assigned e.g.:\nThe channel mode modify procedure is initiated by the network sending a CHANNEL MODE MODIFY message and completed by the mobile station changing the mode of the TCH and sending back a CHANNEL MODE MODIFY ACKNOWLEDGE message.\n7.1.7\tChannel release\nOnce the transaction phase has been completed, the channel is released by the channel release procedure. The data link layer is released explicitly as described in 3GPP TS 44.006. After the channel release is completed, the radio resources which were in use may be reallocated by the network.",

For a detailed description of the handling of this codec list by 3G_MSC-A and 3G_MSC-B see 3GPP TS 23.153.\n\nAlternatively, if 3G_MSC-B is known to support the use of the Iu Supported Codecs List, 3G_MSC-A may configure the RANAP RAB parameters according to the preferred codec and indicate this to 3G_MSC-B by including the RAB configuration indicator in the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request. The decision to use this option is based on internal configuration information in 3G_MSC-A.\nFor an assignment in UTRAN Iu mode, 3G_MSCA shall also include the NAS Synch Indicator in the Iu-RAB-ASSIGNMENT-REQUEST.\nIf 3G_MSCB indicates to 3G_MSCB and to 3G_MSCA that at least one of two procedures (RAB) assignment or Handover Number allocation can not be completed, then 3G_MSCA shall terminate the circuit establishment attempt. The existing connection to the UE shall be maintained, if possible.\nUpon receipt of the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request, 3G_MSCB shall perform the requested RAB assignment operation towards the RNS. In addition it shall retrieve a Handover Number from VLR-B.\n\nFor speech calls, if 3G_MSC-B supports the selection of codec based on the Iu-Supported Codecs List, 3G_MSCB shall select an Iu Selected codec from the Iu Supported Codecs List and connect a transcoder. If the Iu Supported Codecs List was not received or 3G_MSC-B does not support the selection of codec based on the Iu-Supported Codecs List, 3G_MSCB shall select the appropriate default speech codec.\n3G_MSC-B shall reconfigure the RANAP RAB parameters according to the Iu Selected codec:\nAdditionally, for an assignment in UTRAN Iu mode, 3G_MSC-B shall include the NAS Synch Indicator for the Iu Selected codec in the Iu-RAB-ASSIGNMENT-REQUEST. If the Iu Supported Codecs List was received by 3G_MSC-B and 3G_MSC-B supports the selection of codec based on the Iu-Supported Codecs List, then the Iu Selected codec shall be indicated in the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER response, sent from 3G_MSCB to 3G_MSCA.\n\nIf a failure occurs in the RAB assignment or Handover Number allocation then it shall be reflected in the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER response that at least one of these two procedures has not been completed (i.e. either by a MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER result with the RAB assignment procedure outcome and the Handover Number allocation outcome or by a MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER error).\nWhen 3G_MSCA receives a successful MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER response, it shall establish a circuit connection to 3G_MSCB by using the appropriate network supported procedures. In figure 39 this is indicated by the IAM (Initial Address Message) and ACM (Address Complete Message). 3G_MSCB shall also send the Answer message if appropriate to the signalling system.

SUPL operations must take place in combination with control-plane procedures over NRPPa.\n\nThis situation could arise in the case of UE-assisted OTDOA, for example, in which the SLP needs to provide the UE (in a SUPL session) with assistance data supplied by the NG-RAN. This clause uses a UE-assisted OTDOA positioning operation as an example.\n\nAlthough the positioning server in this operation is the SLP, the existence of an interface to the LMF means that the SLP can communicate with the LMF via the SPC. In particular, this means that assistance data that was delivered to the LMF via NRPPa can be transferred over to the SLP for delivery to the UE via LPP over SUPL.\n\nThere are several ways to realise this general behaviour. In the simplest case, the LMF could be supplied with the necessary assistance data in advance, so that it can be supplied to the SLP without any actual NRPPa procedures taking place in real time (and possibly even before the positioning transaction begins).\n\nIn the event that the LMF does not have the required assistance data available, it would need to retrieve them from the NG-RAN once it was made aware that they were needed.\n\nIn both cases, it should be noted that the retrieval of the assistance data is transparent to the UE and to the actual SUPL session. This model is parallel to the approach used with A-GNSS, in which assistance data such as satellite ephemerides are retrieved from sources entirely external to the cellular network. For purposes of LPP over SUPL, the delivery of assistance data to the SLP can be viewed as an independent external process.\n\nThe delivery of assistance data to the UE, however, takes place through the same mechanisms as control-plane LPP, transported through SUPL.\n\nAnnex B (informative):\nChange history",

The cases where the procedure is triggered are described in clause 4.\nThe procedure is shown in figure 7.9/3GPP TS 23.108. The network may decide whether to allocate a new TMSI during location updating, and this option is reflected in this example.\nThe mobile station initiates immediate assignment, service request using the LOCATION UPDATING REQUEST message, and contention resolution.\nThe network requires authentication (this again is an option).\nAs the network intends to allocate a new TMSI, it should activate ciphering. The network includes the new TMSI in the LOCATION UPDATING ACCEPT message (it could also use the explicit TMSI reallocation procedure, see clause 4). The mobile station sends a TMSI REALLOCATION COMPLETE message to the network to acknowledge the receipt of the new TMSI. Upon receipt of the TMSI REALLOCATION COMPLETE message the network initiates the channel release if no further transactions are scheduled.\n\n7.3.2\tMobile originating call establishment\nThe mobile station initiates immediate assignment, service request using the CM SERVICE REQUEST message, and contention resolution. The network may initiate authentication and may start the ciphering mode setting.\nAfter sending the CIPHERING MODE COMPLETE message, the mobile station initiates call establishment by sending the SETUP message to the network. The network answers with a CALL PROCEEDING message.\n7.3.3\tMobile terminating call establishment\nMobile terminating call establishment is initiated by the network sending a PAGING REQUEST message (see figure 7.11a/3GPP TS 23.108). Upon receiving this message the mobile station initiates the immediate assignment procedure and responds to the network by sending the PAGING RESPONSE message within a layer 2 SABM frame.

The spatial characteristics of these signals can be modeled according to the channel matrix generated according to Clauses 5.3, 5.4, and 5.5. However, it may be prohibitively complex to explicitly model the spatial characteristics of all interfering sectors, especially those whose received powers are relatively weak. It has been shown that by modelling the signals of relatively weak interferers as spatially white (and thereby ignoring their spatial characteristics), the resulting performance difference is negligible. The following four steps outline the procedure for modelling intercell interference.\n\nTo model the remaining \"weak\" sectors, we assume that the mean power of the flat Rayleigh fading process is equal to the effects of pathloss and shadowing from each sector. Therefore if the received power from the b-th sector due to pathloss and shadowing is , then the Rayleigh fading process for the m-th receive antenna (m = 1,…, M) as a function of time is given by  where the mean of  over time is . The fading processes for each sector and receive antenna are independent, and the doppler rate is determined by the speed of the mobile. We assume that the fading is equivalent for each mobile receive antenna.  The total received noise power per receive antenna due to all \"weak\" sectors at the m-th antenna is\n\nwhere F is the set of indices for the \"weak\" sectors.\n\nFor 3-sector systems, we model the B = 8 strongest sectors. For 6-sector systems, we model B = 12 strongest sectors. The values for B are based on simulation results for the typical cell layout with a single hexagonal cell surrounded by two rings of cells (a total of 19 cells) and with users placed in the center cell. For other layouts, different values of B or an entirely different technique may be required to properly account for the intercell interference.",

When the Serving RNS (RNS-A) makes the decision to perform the SRNS Relocation procedure it will send an IU-RELOCATION-REQUIRED message to the 3G_MSC (3G_MSCA). The IU-RELOCATION-REQUIRED message shall contain the identifier of the target RNS to which the Relocation is to be performed. When the 3G_MSCA receives the IU-RELOCATION-REQUIRED message it shall begin the process of relocating the serving RNS functionality to the new RNS (RNS-B). The 3G_MSCA shall generate an IU-RELOCATION-REQUEST message to the selected RNS (RNS-B). For the relocation of a speech call to UTRAN Iu mode, 3G_MSCA shall include the NAS Synch Indicator in the Iu-RELOCATION-REQUEST, if the Iu Selected codec to be used after the relocation is different from the Iu Currently used codec.\n\nIf 3G_MSC-A supports SRNS Relocation to a CSG cell and RNS-A includes a CSG ID for the target cell in the IU-RELOCATION-REQUIRED message, then 3G_MSC-A shall check the CSG membership of the UE for the target cell as described in subclause 4.3.1 before generating the Iu-RELOCATION-REQUEST message. If the UE fails the CSG membership check and the target cell is a CSG cell, 3G_MSC-A shall send an IU-RELOCATION-PREPARATION-FAILURE to RNS-A.\nWhen RNS-B receives the IU-RELOCATION-REQUEST message it shall take the necessary action to establish the new Iu transport bearers for each Radio Access Bearer related to 3G_MSCA for the UE in question, this is detailed in the 3GPP TS 25.430 series and 3GPP TS 25.413.\nOnce resource allocation has been completed by RNS-B it shall return an IU-RELOCATION-REQUEST-ACKNOWLEDGE to 3G_MSCA. When this message is received by 3G_MSCA, and 3G_MSCA is ready for the move in Serving RNS functionality, it shall indicate the completion of the preparation phase on the core network side for the SRNS Relocation. An IU-RELOCATION-COMMAND message is sent by 3G_MSCA to RNS-A. RNS-A acts as follows:\n\nWhen the relocation execution trigger is received, RNS-B shall then take the necessary action to assume the role of Serving RNS and shall send an IU-RELOCATION-DETECT message to 3G_MSCA. When the UE is successfully in communication with the RNS-B, then RNS-B shall send an IU-RELOCATION-COMPLETE message to 3G_MSCA.\nAfter 3G_MSCA has received the IU-RELOCATION-COMPLETE message from RNS-B, it shall begin to release the resources associated to the RNS-A. In figures 10 and 11, the resources are released by using the IURELEASECOMMAND sequence.\nIf a failure occurs during the SRNS Relocation attempt, then 3G_MSCA will terminate the relocation to RNS-B. For example, if IU-RELOCATION-FAILURE is returned from RNS-B then 3G_MSCA will terminate the relocation to RNS-B and send IU-RELOCATION-PREPARATION-FAILURE to RNS-A. If IU-RELOCATION-CANCEL is returned from RNS-A, then 3G_MSCA will terminate the relocation to RNS-B and send IU-RELOCATION-CANCEL-ACKNOWLEDGE to RNS-A.\n\nIn all cases the existing connection to the UE shall not be cleared except in the case of expiry of the timer for receipt of Iu-RELOCATION-COMPLETE.\nDuring the period that the UE is not in communication with the network, 3G_MSCA shall queue all appropriate messages. All messages shall be delivered to the UE once communication is resumed. In the case of an Intra-3G_MSC SRNS Relocation (with or without change of  radio resources) on 3G_MSCB, then the messages shall be queued by 3G_MSCB.",

The location information for each MS is stored in functional units called location registers. Functionally, there are two types of location registers:\nSee also 3GPP TS 23.002 where the network architecture is described, and 3GPP TS 23.008 where the data stored in the location registers are described.\nThe action taken by a MS in order to provide location information to the PLMN will be referred to as location updating.\n2.2\tLocation area and MSC area\nThe MSC area is composed of the area covered by all base stations controlled by the MSC. An MSC area may consist of several location areas. A location area is an area in which, after having performed a location update once, MSs may roam without being required to perform subsequent location updates for reason of location change. A location area consists of one or more cells.\n\nFor further details of the network architecture, see 3GPP TS 23.002.\n2.3\tLocation area identification\nThe Location Area Identification (LAI) plan is part of the base station identification plan. The base stations are identified uniquely (see 3GPP TS 23.003).\n2.4\tIMSI detach/attach operation\nThe support of IMSI detach/attach operation is mandatory in MSs. The facility is optional in the fixed infrastructure of the PLMN.\n2.4.1\tExplicit IMSI detach/attach\nExplicit IMSI detach operation is the action taken by an MS to indicate to the PLMN that the station has entered an inactive state (e.g. the station is powered down). Explicit IMSI attach operation is the action taken by an MS to indicate that the station has re-entered an active state (e.g. the station is powered up).\n2.4.2\tImplicit IMSI detach\n\nImplicit IMSI detach operation is the action taken by the VLR to mark an MS as detached when there has been no successful contact between the MS and the network for a time determined by the implicit detach timer. The value of the implicit detach timer is derived from the periodic location updating timer; when the MSC/VLR applies Mobility Management Congestion Control to a MS, the MSC/VLR may need to adjust the Implicit Detach timer as specified in clause 3.7.2. During an established radio contact, the implicit detach timer shall be prevented from triggering implicit detach. At the release of the radio connection, the implicit detach timer shall be reset and restarted. Implicit IMSI detach shall also be performed in the case of a negative response to an IMEI check.\n2.5\tUse of the term mobile station (MS) in the present document\n\nIn order to simplify the text the term Mobile Station (MS) as used in relation to location management refers to the entity where the IMSI is stored, i.e., in card operated MSs the term Mobile Station (MS) refers to the card.\n2.6\tPaging area\nAs an option, and for paging optimization purpose, the VLR may control Paging Areas. A Paging Area (PgA) is composed of up to 5 Location Areas, and the MSC area is composed of several Paging Areas. Paging areas may overlap each other. The Paging Area is stored in the HLR and updated at each paging area change. The Paging Area is sent by the HLR to the VLR at roaming number request and may be used by the MSC/VLR for paging (e.g. when LAI is not known, after MSC/VLR restart) (see 3GPP TS 23.018 [5a]).",

If the UICC is removed from the 3G terminal, the service shall be terminated immediately. The functions of the USIM include authenticating itself to the network and vice versa, authenticating the user and providing additional security functions as defined in 3GPP TS 33.102 [7].\n\nThe USIM shall be unambiguously identified.\n\nMeans shall be provided to prevent fraudulent use of stolen UICCs.\n\nIt shall not be possible to access data intended for USIM internal use, e.g. authentication keys.\n\nFurther details of the following requirements are given in 3GPP TS 33.102 [7].\n\n5.1\tFile access conditions\n\nActions, such as READ, UPDATE on UICC data shall be controlled by access conditions. These shall be satisfied prior to the action being performed.\n\nSince a UICC may contain multiple (3G and non-3G) applications, a flexible method of controlling file access shall be provided.\n\n5.2\tUser authentication\n\nThe USIM shall support means to authenticate the user, to provide, for example, protection against the use of stolen cards. For the USIM, authentication shall be performed by the verification of a numeric PIN of four (4) to eight (8) decimal digits.\n\nA function to disable user authentication may exist which may be inhibited by the application provider, in which case the user shall always use the PIN. Otherwise, the user may decide whether or not to make use of the user authentication function. If disabled, the user authentication function remains disabled until the user specifically re-enables it.\n\nFollowing correct PIN presentation, the ME may perform functions and actions on USIM data, which are protected by the relevant access condition.\n\nIf an incorrect PIN is entered, an indication shall be given to the user. After three (3) consecutive incorrect entries the relevant PIN is blocked, i.e. functions and actions on data protected by the access condition shall no longer be possible, even if between attempts the UICC has been removed, the USIM has been deselected or the ME has been switched off. Once a PIN is blocked, further PIN verifications shall be denied.\n\nThe USIM shall support a mechanism for unblocking a blocked PIN. Unblocking of a PIN is performed by using the relevant PIN Unblocking Key.\n\nPINs, but not Unblock PINs, shall be changeable by the user following correct entry of either the current PIN or Unblock PIN.\n\nThe Unblock PIN shall consist of eight (8) decimal digits and shall not be changeable by the user. If an incorrect Unblock PIN is presented, an indication shall be given to the user. After ten (10) consecutive incorrect entries, the Unblock PIN shall be blocked, even if between attempts the UICC has been removed, the USIM has been deselected or the ME has been switched off. Unblocking of a blocked PIN shall not be possible.\n\nIt shall not be possible to read PINs or Unblock PINs.\n\n5.3\tUser data stored in ME\n\nSubject to the exception below, all user related information transferred into the ME during network operations shall be deleted from the ME after removal of the UICC, deselection of the USIM, deactivation of the ME, or following an electrical reset of the UICC. This includes any data that was transferred to the ME by USIM Application Toolkit commands.\n\nUser related security codes such as PIN and Unblock PIN may only be stored by the ME during the procedures involving such a code and shall be discarded by the ME immediately after completion of the procedure.\n\nOptionally, an ME may retain some less security-sensitive data at UICC removal, USIM deselection or ME switch-off. Such data are e.g. SMS, ADN/SSC, FDN/SSC, LND. These data, when stored in the ME, shall only be readable/retrievable if the same USIM is reactivated (as determined by the IMSI). If the IMSI is retained in the ME for this purpose, it shall be stored securely and shall not be able to be read out.\n\n5.4\tAuthentication\n\nA means shall be specified to mutually authenticate the USIM and the network by showing knowledge of a secret key K which is shared between and available only to the USIM and in the user's Home Environment. The method is composed of a challenge/response and key establishment protocol combined with a sequence number-based one-pass protocol for network authentication.\n\n5.5\tData integrity of signalling elements\n\nSome signalling information elements are considered sensitive and must be integrity protected. An integrity function shall be applied on certain signalling information elements transmitted between the ME and the network.\n\nThe 3GPP Integrity Algorithm (UIA) is used with an Integrity Key (IK) to compute a message authentication code for a given message. The setting of IK is triggered by the authentication procedure. IK shall be stored on the USIM.\n\n5.6\tUser identity confidentiality\n\nA mechanism shall be specified to provide user identity confidentiality by means of a temporary identity.\n\n5.7\tLength of security parameters\n\nIn order to allow for enhancements of the security level in 3G, the following requirements shall be covered:\n\nIf the USIM supports the GSM security mechanisms in addition to 3G security, fixed length security parameters according to 3GPP TS 51.011 [8] shall be supported in addition.",

The untruncated name and some of the metadata are to be retrieved from authoritative data sources by the terminating service provider.\n\nDescription\n\neCNAM does not deliver messages from the originator across multiple networks to the terminating user. eCNAM is a service that resides in the terminating service provider's (SP) network, most likely in the Telephony Application Server (TAS). However, it utilizes the identity information received in SIP signalling.\n\nThe untruncated name is delivered in the \"display-name\" parameter of the From header field and/or P-Asserted-Identity header field that the terminating Application Server sends to the terminating UE.\n\nThe metadata will be delivered in one or more Call-Info header field(s). The eCNAM service logic in the AS assembles and formats several data elements (subject to local policy). eCNAM metadata may include type of call, location of a business, or language of the originator. Furthermore, eCNAM metadata may include the results of robocalling analytics that are used to alert the subscriber of possible scams. Typically, service providers partner with analytics providers that offer risk indicators about incoming calls (e.g., known scammers). The results of such analytics are relayed to the user in the form of text strings and/or icons to be displayed on his/her UE. The eCNAM Call-Info header fields support the delivery of text and icons. Given the changing nature of scams, the results of the analytics are expected to vary. eCNAM provides the advantage of a flexible \"envelope\" - namely the Call-Info header field(s) - that delivers different types of payload without having to modify existing standards frequently.\n\nReferences",

Tech.: Fading\n\nIntuitive understanding of Fading would be simple, but the detailed description is pretty difficult and would be even more difficult to understand the details without going through the complicated mathematical process. This page would start with Intuitive description and try to keep adding the details one by one. It will take long time to complete the pages and will split this into multiple pages if it goes too long.\n\nIn most of the wireless communication environement, a signal out of a transmitter radiate into wide direction and these radiated signal takes different path and arriving at the reciever at different timing and with different signal strength(amplitude). As a result, the signal coming into the reciever is the composite of all the components. As you may learned in high school physics, when thetwo\ncopies of the signal get combined the resulting signal can be an augmented signal or attenuated signal depending on whether the two signal constructively combined or destructively combined.\n\nThen what determines whether the signals constructively combine or destructively combine ? The answer also come from high school physics. The phase of the two signal determines whether the signal constructively combine or destructively combine.\n\nIn wireless communication environment, many copies of the signals get combined at the reciever side and some of them constructively combines and some of them destructively combines. So final result of combination of all the incoming signals become very complicated and the combined signal becomes drastically different from the original signal tranmitted from the source. In most case, the quality\nof the combined signal at the reciever gets poorer (deteriorated) than the original signal. This kind of process of signal deterioration by the multiple propogation path of a signal is called 'Fading'. When we say \"Fading\", it usually implies \"Signal quality gets bad\".\n\nFor more intuitive unerstanding of the fading, I will show you a couple of different aspect of fading you can mesure using various equipments.\n\nFirst, let's compare a faded signal and non-faded signal using a spectrum analyzer. You would get the two results as follows and you will see the highly fluctuating amplitude across the channel bandwidth. (Note : These two capture are not the one from the same signal, so comparing the absolute value of the amplitude does not make any sense. Just take the image of overall amplitude profile).\n\nNow let's look at how the fading influence the signal quality decoded by the reciever. Look at the following samples of constellation for faded and non-faded signal.\n\nNow let's get into even further and I think this is the thing that you would be most interested in. How this fading would influence the final performance. Following graph shows the data rate at PHY layer and PDCP layer. The plot showing at the top (labeled as 'PHY Transmission Rate') is the amount of data being transmitted per second by PHY layer of the transmitter. The plot in the middle\n(labeled as 'PHY throughput with HARQ ACK' is the amount of data getting ACKED per second from the reiever PHY layer. You see there is pretty much gap between the two plots. It means that a considerable portions of the data were failed to get properly decoded by the reciever and the reciever sent NACK for the data. Normally in this case, the transmitter PHY layer retransmits the previous data rather than moving into the next step of the transmission.\n\nThe plot at the bottom (labelled as 'PDCP Transmission Rate') is the amount of data being sent to the lower layer from the transmitter's PDCP layer. You will see another gap here. It is not easy to explain exactly what is causing this gap. In this case, some portions of the gap would come from the overhead of higher layer data structure but majority of the gap would be because PDCP cannot\npush the data down to the lower layer since PHY layer is too busy with retransmitting the previous data rather than transmitting the new data coming from the higher layer.\n\nThere are many factors generating Fading effect. Followings are the list of components (factors) of fading we can think of.\n\nTo study on fading requires the detailed understanding of each of these components. If I express some major components in visual form, it can be presented as follows. Just from the high level view, you should see some typtical pattern from this representation. First notice that the horizontal axis represents 'Distance in Linear Scale'. You may have seen a lot of different plots in various\ntextbook and get confused by those. One of the first step to remove those confusion would be clearly understanding the meaning of axis of the graph. Even for the same things, you would see different shape of plots if you define the meaning of the axis differently. One of the factors from various text confusing you the most is the scale of each axis. For example, in case of path loss graph in some textbook where they represent the axis in log scale you would see a straight line, but in this page you\nare seeing a kind of negative exponential graph since the axis is represented in linear scale.\n\nPath loss is just gradually decreases but not much of fluctuation. In the second plot, you see some fluctuation of the signal strength but the fluctuation frequency over the distance is not that high. In the third plot, you see fluctuations of signal strength and the fluctuation frequency is also pretty high.\n\nWhen you observe a real received signal, you wouldn't see these factors in separate form as in the graph on the left side. What you see at the real reciever is the result of summation of all the factors and it is like the graph on the right side.\n\nProbably the words you might have heard the most frequently when you talking about fading would be 'Fast Fading', 'Slow Fading'. Intuitively it sounds simple. But not easy to find clear/technical defintion for these. How fast it should be to be Fast Fading ? How slow it should be to be Slow Fading ?\n\nI found a very good definition and technical explanation from the reference [2]. It states as follows:\n\nFast Fading is used to describe channels in which Channel Coherence Time < Tansmission Symbol Time. Fast Fading describes a condition where the time duration in which the channel behaves in a correlated mannel is short compared to the time duration of a symbol. Therefore, it can be expected that the fading characteristic of the channel will change several times while a symbol is propagating, leading to distortion of the baseband pulse shape. Analogous to the distortion described as ISI, the distortion take place because the recieved signal's components are not all highly correlated throughout time. Hence, fast fading can cause the baseband pulse to be distorted, resulting in a loss of SNR that often yields an irreducible error rate. Such distorted pulses cause synchronization problems (failure of phase-locked-loop recievers), in addition to difficulties in adequately defining a matched filter.\n\nSlow Fading is used to describe channels in which Channel Coherence Time > Tansmission Symbol Time. Here, the time duration that the channel behaves in a correlated manner is long compared to the time duration of a transmission symbol. Thus, one can expect the channel state to virtually remain unchanged during the time in which a symbol is transmitted. The propaging symbols will likely not suffer from the pulse distortion. The primary degradation in a slow-fading channel, as with flat fading, is loss in SNR.\n\nPath Loss and Shadowing may not be considered to be a part of Fading in narrow sense, but it can be considered as a factor causing the fading in wider sense. Understanding or Modeling the path loss is not that difficult. You may see a mathematical model which you were faimilar with in your high school math. The famous format of anti-proportional to 'something squared'.\n\nModling for Path Loss is done with the respect to the distance between a transmitter and receiver. The key question is ..\n\nTest A) When a transmitter antenna is transmitting a certain (fixed) amount of energy and you put a measurement antenna which is a certain distance (let's call this distance as 'd') and measure the received(measured) energy. Once you get the value at a certain 'd', write down the value. And then move the reciever antenna a little bit further and do the same measurement and write down\nthe value. Repeat this process as you move 'd' further and further and collect all the measured value and plot it on the graph with horizontal axis = d and vertical axis = measured energy level (power). How would the plot look like ? Can you come up with an equation to represent the graph ?\n\nTest B) Now let's try a little bit different type of measurement. This time, draw a circle with radius d with the transmitter antenna at the center. and then put several antenna along the circumference and measure the received power at each antenna and plot the value with horizontal axis = location of receiver antenna and vertical axis = measured energy level (power). How would the\nplot look like ?\n\nTest C) Now let's think about two test environment. In one setup there is no obstacles between the reciever and transmitter antenna (Let's call this as 'Setup A'). In the other setup, there are a lot of obstacles (like building, tree, houses, mountain etc) between the transmitter antenna and reciever antenna (Let's call this as 'Setup B'). Then you do the measurement described in Test\nB) for both setup and compare the result. Would you see any difference ? what kind of difference would you see ?\n\nThese three test will be used as a basis for modeling following cases. (Details will come later)\n\nThe first thing we can think of is a kind of ideal case called 'Free Space'. In this case, we assume that there is no obstacles between the transmitter and reciever antenna.\n\nIn this case, the measured power at every reciever antenna at the same distance from the transmitter antenna would be same and the received signal power can be modeled as follows. (Basically this equation is a form of Frris' Transmission Equation )\n\nIf you want to convert this equation to a form which most of RF engineers are more familiar with (dBm scale), you can just apply 10 log( ) on both side and go through following steps. Of course, you don't have to memorize the each of these steps. Just try to understand overall concept and logic of this process.\n\nLife would be much easier if the condition between the transmission antenna and reciever antenna is always as decribed in previous case (Free Space).\n\nIn real life situation, it is highly likely that you would see a lot of obstacles (like building, Tree, mountain etc). If I draw this situation in a little bit simplified way, it would be as follows.\n\nThe path loss at a certain distance can be expressed as follows. Compare this with the free space case. What kind of difference do you see ?\n\nIn case of free space model, once the distance is determined the received power can be determined automatically meaning that if d is fixed(same), you would get the same measured value (recieved power) for every measurement. But in this case, you cannot gurantee the same measured value even though the distance is same. Even though d is same, you would get the different measured value if beta\n(Path Loss Exponent) is different or epsilon (Random Variable) is different.\n\nThen the question would be 'How the Path Loss Exponent and Random Variable is determined ?'. There is no strict theory that can determine these values deterministically. It is usually determined empirically. According to various researches,\n\nIf you apply Log (10 log[ ] more specifically) to both side, you can get a linear equation in dB (dBm) scalse as shown below.\n\nA defining characteristic of the mobile wireless channel is to build up a mathematical model for the variations of the channel strength over time and over frequency. There are mainly two factors influencing the variations of the channel strength as listed below.\n\nAs a starting point, please... please ... please ... read very carefully about the section of Signal Presentation, Impulse Response and Convolution section before you go deeper into this section.\n\nLet's suppose we have a case as shown below. A UE is communicating with a eNodeB and there is a lot of building between the UE and the eNodeB. You may intuitively guess the eNodeB would get the multiple copies of the same signal from UE because the same signal can reach the eNodeB via multiple path as shown below. Let's assume that we have four different path as shown below. There are two\nmajor characteristics of the paths. One is attenuation and the other one is time delay. Of course there would be several additional factors, but these two components would be the largest factors. Let's assume that each of the path has the delay and attenuation as shown below.\n\nHow do we represent a channel using these delay and attenuator factor ? There can be a couple of different ways to represent it, but one of the most common way would be to represent it as an impulse response model. Even though you may not familiar with the term 'impulse response', you may have seen this kind of description if you have any experience of using channel simulators (fader) and\ndealt with fading profile. Following is the graphical representation of impulse response of the four paths in this example and physical meaning of it. I hope this make sense to you.\n\nIf you represent this impulse response into a mathematical form, it become as follows. If you are not familiar with this kind of mathematical representation. Read again the section of Signal Representation. (When you are first learning this way of signal representation.. you may think .. what the hell is delta function\n? Why we need this kind of function ? etc... this is one example why you need to learn those textbook concept).\n\nLet's look into a example that (hopefully) would give you more concrete understanding of these concepts.\n\nLet's suppose that a signal goes through six different path (multipath) as indicated in plot (1). Horizontal axis represents the time delay from the transmission to arrival at the reciever antenna. Vertical axis indicates the amplitude of the received signal. plot(2)~(7) shows the signal going through each path reaching to Rx antenna. If you look at each plots, you would notice that the phase\n(time delay) and amplitude are different from each other. plot (8) shows the summation of all the plots from (2) through (6). This is the signal being sensed by the recieving antenna.\n\nWhat do you observe from the plot (8) (the sum of all the multipath signal) ? You would notice that the amplitude and phase gets different from the transmitted signal, but overall shape of the signal is same as the transmitted signal. It means that no distortion happened by this multipath.\n\nNow let's think of how the received signal is influenced by the multipath with the frequency of the transmitted signal. I created plots for three different frequency (In this case, the amplitude of transmitted signal are same for all frequencies). As you see at plot (8) of each case (w=1,2,5), the amplitude of the total received signal gets different depending on frequency.\n\nNote : This shows the cases of only three different frequencies. Isn't there any way of showing the amplitude of total received signal for all the different frequencies in easier way ? We will look into this shortly.\n\nFollowing is the Octave source code (I think this would work with Matlab as well) for the graphs shown above, try playing the list 'a' and 'tau', get some intuitive understanding on your own.\n\nplot(t,real(exp_iwt)); xlim([0 2]);ylim([-1 1]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[-1 0 1]);\n\nplot(t,imag(exp_iwt)); xlim([0 2]);ylim([-1 1]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[-1 0 1]);\n\nplot(t,real(exp_iwt_sum),'r-'); xlim([0 2]);ylim([-3 3]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[-3 0 3]);\n\nplot(t,imag(exp_iwt_sum),'r-'); xlim([0 2]);ylim([-3 3]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[-3 0 3]);\n\nplot(w,real(Hw)); xlim([0 wmax]);ylim([-1 1]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[-1 0 1]);\n\nplot(w,imag(Hw)); xlim([0 wmax]);ylim([-1 1]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[-1 0 1]);\n\nplot(w,abs(Hw)); xlim([0 wmax]);ylim([0 1]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[0 1]);\n\nplot(w,real(Hw_sum),'r-'); xlim([0 wmax]);ylim([-5 5]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[-5 0 5]);\n\nplot(w,imag(Hw_sum),'r-'); xlim([0 wmax]);ylim([-5 5]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[-5 0 5]);\n\nplot(w,abs(Hw_sum),'r-'); xlim([0 wmax]);ylim([0 5]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[0 5]);\n\nNow we have a channel described in the form of impulse response. Let's suppose that we have a signal x(t) going through the channel. The x(t) will split into multiple pathes in the channel and take the different route and finally recombine at the receiver antenna. What would the signal at the receiving antenna look like ? There is an excellent mathematical tool to give you the answer to this\nquestion. It is a tool called 'Convolution'. If you just take the convolution of channel impulse response and input signal (x(t)), you would take the signal at the receiving antenna.\n\nWhen we specify a Fading Channel profile, we are usually given a table with tap delay and relative power for each tap. You may visualize the table as shown below. Usually those profile table in the specification does not specify statistical information for the tap, but usually some specific statistical profile is associated with each tap. In case of LTE channel profile (Tap Delay Line : TDL), usually each tap is associated with statistical power profile as shown below. Usually the first tap indicates the fading on line of sight path that is modeled in Rician distribution and the remaining taps indicates the fading channel on non line of sight path that is modeled in Rayleigh distribution.\n\nWhen it comes to using this channel profile in fading implementation, I would take this as the impulse response of the fading channel. Then, the modeling of a signal passing through a fading channel can be represented as the convolution of signal and the fading channel as illustrated below.\n\nSound simple ? Yes simple conceptually, but there is a difficulties in reality. It is about how to apply the statistically property associated with each tap.\n\nEach tap is associated with a specific statistical power and doppler profile. It mean that the power for each tap for each steps of convolution changes and the frequency shift for each tap for each steps of convolution changes according to specific statistical profile as illustrated below.\n\nApplying these changing impulse response, the faded signal is generated as illustrated below. (In real implementation, there are various techniques are used to generate this kind of varing channel impulse response. One widely used mathology is to use Jake's model).\n\nIn addition to this delay, gain, PDF, we have to think about the correlations among all the antenna on transmitter and reciever side as follows.\n\nThese correlation is defined in 3GPP as shown below and this correlation matrix should be applied to the Fading model when we use multiple antenna configuration.\n\nDo you see any difference between the matrix shown above (channel matrix) for 2 x 2 MIMO and the correlation matrix as shown below for 2 x 2 case ?\n\nOne obvious difference is size of the matrix. The channel matrix shown above is 2x2 matrix and the correlation matrix for 2 x 2 case shown below is 4x4.\n\nAny idea on how the 2x2 matrix show above is converted to 4 x 4 matrix shown below ?\n\n(The full correlation matrices is obtained by Tensor Product/Kronecker product\nof two antenna correlation matrix)\n\nLet's start with the simplest case and add piece by piece until we reach more realistic (complex) cases.\n\nLet's suppose that you have two Tx antenna and one Rx antenna. If draw this situation as in channel model, you can draw this setup as follows. (Let's call this a Case A)\n\nIn this setup, you have two channel path(channel coefficient) h1 and h2. Now let's think about all the possible relation between these two channel. If you draw all the possible relationships as a diagram, you may represent as follows.\n\nIf you represent these relationship between the two channel path (channel coefficient) in a matrix format, you can represent it as follows. (I would not explain it in detail but you would need to have some intuitive understanding of vector/matrix. This is why you should have taken such a boring linear algebra course in the university. If you are really new to this vector/matrix concept,\nVector/Matrix page on this site). Be careful, you may get confused with 2 x 2 matrix to be used to model 2 x 2 MIMO channel. (At least I was confused a lot at the beginning. I would not talk too much about it, but I strongly recommend you to compare the two matrix and clearly understand the difference between them). Just to give you the conclusion about the difference between the two matrix, the matrix shown\nhere represents the correlation between each channel path(the path the signal flow through) and the matrix shown in channel model represents the correlation between Tx and Rx antenna.\n\nThe 'Beta' value represents the cross correlation between channel coefficient h1 and h2.\n\nNow we have a different case. In this case, you have two Tx antenna and one Rx antenna. If draw this situation as in channel model, you can draw this setup as follows. (Let's call this a Case B)\n\nIf you represent these relationship between the two channel path (channel coefficient) in a diagram, you can represent it as follows.\n\nIf you represent these relationship between the two channel path (channel coefficient) in a matrix format,, you can represent it as follows.The 'Alpha' value represents the cross correlation between channel coefficient h1 and h2.\n\nNow let's look into more complicated case. In this case, you have two transmitter antenna and two reciever antenna. The antenna and channel path can be illustrated as follows. You can think of this as a combination of Case A and Case B described above.\n\nNow if you represents the correlations between each of these channel coefficients, it can be represented as follows.\n\nAs you did in case A and B, if you represents these correlations in vector/matrix format, you would get a big matrix as follows. How did you get the last matrix ?. Actually it came from the matrix for Case A and B described above. If you clearly understood the meaning of Beta and Alpha in Case A and B, you would easily understand how each of the elements in this big matrix can be represented\nas 'Alpha' or 'Beta'.\n\nwhat about the '?' part shown above ? Filling out these '?' is not so straigtforward. If you brow the statical concept (I cannot explain though :)), those parts are the places where the correlation between part of Case A and part of Case B and can be filled as follows.\n\nHow to derive MIMO coeifficient matrix mathematically from Diversity coefficient matrix ?\n\nI have explained how we got 2x2 MIMO correlation matrix from physical perspective and the each elements of 2 x 2 MIMO matrix can be derived from the elements of 2x1 Diversity matrix. I strongly recommend you to try to get familiar with this concept and build your own intuition. But as the number of antenna increases, deriving all the correlation matrix as I described above would not be that\neasy. Fortunately there is a mathematical way of deriving the MIMO correlation matrix from Diversity Correlation matrix. The MIMO correlation matrix can be derived by taking Kronecker product of two Diversity matrix as shown below. (If you are not familar with the concept of Kronecker product, refer to this page)\n\nThe last component I want to show you about Fading is Doppler spread. Doppler spread is caused by the well known phenomenon called 'Doppler Shift' (I would not explain what Doppler shift is. Everybody would learned about this from High school physics and you can easily google out a lot of explanation of this effect).\n\nDoppler spread can be expressed as shown in following function and plot. If you think of 'Doppler spread' as a kind of filter (or a block in a control system model). You can take the following function as a kind of transfer function of the filter.\n\nAs you see, how much a frequency (fc) get spreaded by doppler spread is indicated by fm. If you see another formula below the graph representing fm, you would see fm is determined by the velocity of object (relative velocify between transmitter and reciever) and speed of light and fc(carrier frequency). You know fc is constant (set by standard and assume hardware is good enough to maintain\nthe fc the same). Now the only variable is the speed v. According to this equation, fm and v are in proportional relation, meaning if v gets higher, fm gets larger (the width of the graph gets wider) and if v gets smaller, fm gets smaller (the width of the graph gets narrower).\n\nHow this kind of plot is obtained ? What is the meaning of this plot. Let's think a little bit further into how we get this plot.\n\nLet's assume that a car (e.g, a phone in a car) is moving in horizontal direction and it is receiving a signal with an angle illustrated as in (A). Since the car is moving, the phone in the car would experience doppler shift. Since the UE is getting the signal with an angle, the doppler shift it percieves can be represented as in red arrow in (B).\n\nNow let's extend this situation further to the situation where the UE in the moving car is receiving the signal from all direction as illustrated below. This is the situation where the UE has so many reflectors around it and recieves the multipath signal all around. Then the doppler shift that UE percieves is like red dots marked on the horizontal line. If you plot those red dots in probability distribution function, you will get the red plot as shown below.\n\nNow you may have question. How differently the narrow Doppler spread and wide doppler spread affect on the signal ?\n\nThe simulation result for these two cases (narrow and wide doppler spread) is shown below. The upper track is for narrow doppler spread and the lower track is for wide doppler spread. As you see, you see much frequency energy fluctuation over time in wide Doppler spectrum. I will update the page later about the mathmatical background.\n\nIf you are using a phone in high speed train, the distance between UE and eNB changes very fast. It means both UE and eNB will be under drastic doppler shift.\n\nFor example, let's suppose the train is traveling right into the eNB as illustrated below (the eNB is right on top of the railway). Of course, you don't see this kind of situation in real life. The train will crash into the eNB in this case. However, just suppose this is possible and train can go through a ghost-like eNB. In this case and assume that the speed of the train is constant, the doppler shift will stay constant as well. The only change is the direction of frequency shift changes as the train pass through eNB as illustrated below.\n\nHowever, in realy you don't see any case shown above in real life. In real life, the eNB is located away from the rail way at certain distance.\n\nIn this case, the Doppler Shift changes as the train get closer to, pass by and farther away from the eNB. The doppler shift at a specific time is represented as shown below (36.101 B.3)\n\nWhere does this equation come from ? It turned out to be from hunior high school geometry, but it took me long time to understand this since there is no background information in 3GPP.\n\nThis model is based on the assumption that the eNBs are spaced equaly and the train moves at a constant speed. It is also assumed that the initial location of the train (the location at t = 0) on the railway is at the mid point between two adjacent eNBs as shown below. Dmin is defined as the closest possible distance between UE and eNB and the initial location is specified to be half way between two adjacent eNBs. Then, the distance between the eNB and the train can be derived. If we define the angle theta as shown below, the cos(theta) will become as below.\n\nNow let's look into a snapshot after t seconds. Now the location of the train on the railway and the distance between UE and eNB, and the cos(theta) is derived as shown below. (Just try to derive on your own or just copy it with a pen on a paper, you will understand it clearly).\n\nIf you plot the doppler shift with time as traing travel along the railway, it would be illustrated as shown below.\n\nFollowing is the Matlab code that I wrote based on the equation shown above. In this, I calculated not only frequency shift but also the angle(theta) to figure out the location of the train more easily.\n\nNow let's do some experiment with the code to understand the impact of the parameters. The first experiment is to change the speed of the train keeping all other parameters same. The doppler shift that UE (on the train) will experience can be plotted as shown below. See if this is aligned with your intuitive understanding.\n\nNow let's do another experiement. In this experiement, I changed Dmin keeping all other parameters same. The doppler shift that UE (on the train) will experience can be plotted as shown below. See if this is aligned with your intuitive understanding.\n\nTypical model for Fading channel can be described by a simple diagram as follows. This is very simplified model but fortunately this is almost enough for 3GPP specification for fading test. As you see, a signal comes into the fading block and splits into multiple path. Each path has three components, namely Delay, PDF, Gain component. By changing these parameters in each path,\nyou can construct pretty complicated fading channel.\n\nIn LTE 3GPP specification, typical three types of Fading profiles are defined as follows.\n\nGo through following pages (examples) and try to get some intuitive understanding on your own.\n\n[2] Rayleigh Fading Channels in Mobile Digital Communication Systems.

Instead, the ISC interface is employed by the S-CSCF online charging, implying that online charging is transparent to the S-CSCF and appears like any other service logic controlled by a SIP application server. Therefore, if support for Ro based online charging is required instead of / or in addition to application server or MRFC, a special CTF is needed in order to mediate between the Ro based SBCF and the SIP based service control. This role is taken by the IMS Gateway Function (IMS GWF), which translates between SIP service control towards the S-CSCF and Ro Credit-Control on the OCS side.\n\nFrom the perspective of the online charging architecture, the IMS GWF is an online charging capable CTF; from the perspective of the S-CSCF, the IMS GWF is a SIP application server and is triggered the same way.

SUPL operations must take place in combination with control-plane procedures over NRPPa.\n\nThis situation could arise in the case of UE-assisted OTDOA, for example, in which the SLP needs to provide the UE (in a SUPL session) with assistance data supplied by the NG-RAN. This clause uses a UE-assisted OTDOA positioning operation as an example.\n\nAlthough the positioning server in this operation is the SLP, the existence of an interface to the LMF means that the SLP can communicate with the LMF via the SPC. In particular, this means that assistance data that was delivered to the LMF via NRPPa can be transferred over to the SLP for delivery to the UE via LPP over SUPL.\n\nThere are several ways to realise this general behaviour. In the simplest case, the LMF could be supplied with the necessary assistance data in advance, so that it can be supplied to the SLP without any actual NRPPa procedures taking place in real time (and possibly even before the positioning transaction begins).\n\nIn the event that the LMF does not have the required assistance data available, it would need to retrieve them from the NG-RAN once it was made aware that they were needed.\n\nIn both cases, it should be noted that the retrieval of the assistance data is transparent to the UE and to the actual SUPL session. This model is parallel to the approach used with A-GNSS, in which assistance data such as satellite ephemerides are retrieved from sources entirely external to the cellular network. For purposes of LPP over SUPL, the delivery of assistance data to the SLP can be viewed as an independent external process.\n\nThe delivery of assistance data to the UE, however, takes place through the same mechanisms as control-plane LPP, transported through SUPL.\n\nAnnex B (informative):\nChange history",

    "context": "https://www.sharetechnote.com/html/IoT/IoT_WhatToChoose.html\n\nIoT: What to choose\n\nNow let's assume that you got the full unstanding of each of the IoT related technology individually and did a little bit of categorization, you may come up with some daisy chain like diagram as illustrated below.\n\nWhat is confusing you would not be the technical details of each individual technology. What confuse you would about 'how one technology differs from other technologies ?' or 'which technology I have to chose for my application or use model ?'\n\nThe simple answer to the question \"Which technology do I have to pick for my application or my use model ?\" is \"It depends on the nature of your application\".\n\nI know.. you would not take this as an answer. You would ask for more specific answers.\n\nIf you want to get more specific answers, you would have specific answers to a lot of specific questions as listed below. (This list would get extended as learn/observe more from various discussions/forums).\n\nI would not put my comments on each of the questions for now.. just to give you some time for you to think.. (good excuse for my laziness :)).\n\nThis is basically asking about the data rate of the end node in your IoT system. Is it collecting a simple data like Temperature, Humidity which takes up only several bytes at a time of transmission. Normally this kind of IoT device should be very low cost. It is less likely to let this kind of device to use relatively expensive network (like cellular network).\n\nThis is asking 'Are you going to use a simple sensors (like temperature, humidity) ?' or some other devices which requires a relatively large packet transmission/reception or which requires very high level data security.\n\nThis would be highly related to Q1. Usually the type of data to be collected and transmitted would determine the necessary data rate, but there might be some exceptions. For example, if you need very sophisticated data security and add a lot of additional portions to the original data to implement the security, the data rate that you would need would get much higher. Another exception can be the case where you want to upgrade/reconfigure your end-node remotely. Of course, this would not happen very often but if you really want to do this, the data rate should be pretty high for the end-node to download necessary firmware and configuration information.\n\nQ4. Does your end node device will both transmit and receive data ? or only transmit the data (no recieve) ?\n\nMost of the IoT application is Uplink centeric (transmission only in terms of end-device) and in some extreme case there are some application that is uplink only. It is understandable for most of IoT application to be Uplink dominant but there would be a lot of restriction if it goes with uplink only. For example, you have a very simple end-device (e.g, a temperature sensor) and transmitted it to a Gateway or Basestation. If the device is uplink only (transmission only), the device can only transmit the data and there is no way to verify whther it successfully reached the destination or not. To verify the successful transmission of the data, there should be some mechanism by which the destination (e.g, Gateway) can send Acknowledge message to the device that has sent the data. To do this, the system should allow downlink (i.e, reception in terms of end-device). Also, if you want to apply any form of data security or remote re-configuration or remote update, you need both uplink and downlink.\n\nLet me ask another question before this .. Are you going to use unlicensed band/frequency (i.e ISM band) or a licensed band / frequency (e.g, Cellular) ? If you decided to use ISM band, it is highly likely to use sub Ghz band (i.e, around 900 Mhz) or around 2.4 Ghz frequency. If you decided to use licensed band, it will be determined by which frequency will be allowed in the area where your IoT system will be installed.\n\nIf you selected unlicensed band, you are free to use any of the frequency .. but it is not only you who is free to use the frequency.. there might be a lot of other devices that uses the same frequency which might cause unwanted interference. If you decided to use the licensed frequency, there will be licensing / permission issue.\n\nIf the transmitter and reciever is communicating within the range of couple of meters or tens of meters, you can use many of the existing short range communication like Bluetooth, ZigBee etc. However, if it should extend to several km or tens of km, you have to use those technologies that can cover wide range like LPWAN (e.g, LoRa, SigFox etc) or Cellular technology.\n\nBasically IoT requires a cirtain type of Network structure whether it is small or large (in most case it is not peer to peer communication). Then you would have question on how to form such a network and how much control you want to have over the whole network. Some people would say 'I want to implement only the end Node(e.g, terminal sensor module) and get it connected to an exisiting network that are already established'. In this case, you would consider Cellular based IoT or SigFox. In this option, you would have less work to do but very limitted or no controllability for network. Some people would say 'I want to implement everything from the end node to the network and I want to have full control over the network'. In this case, you may like LoRa type of technology. You would have full controllability, but downside is that there are a lot of works for you to do.\n\nFor example, SKT deployed a Nation wide IoT service in South Korea around the end of 2016 based on LoRa technology. According to Ref [5], they were considering LoRa, SigFox, NB-LTE(and other LTE based IoT). LTE IoT was excluded for other reason, but between LoRa and SigFox, the controllability to Network was one of the factor to select LoRa.\n\nQ10. Do you need any security for the data being transmitted and received ? At which level, if you need ?\n\nI personally think this is pretty important issue since there are many cases where it is not easy to change / upgrade the software of a IoT end node once it is installed or take too much cost to visit every installation points and change software of the device. However, I don't see this issues widely discussed in the industry yet (as of early 2017). Probably they are afraid to bring up the issues that does not have any simple / easy solution. In theory, the smartest solution is to let the end node device itself to download the new software and upgrade it by itself. We have seen this type of software upgrade in cellular phone (smart phone) pretty commonly these days. We may think of utilizing the similar technologies to IoT devices. However, the biggest problem would be the bandwidth. Most of IoT device is designed for low data rate communication, but this kind of wireless software upgrade would take pretty big bandwidth. So if you think of this kind of wireless software upgrade, you would need to choose such a technology to provide big enough bandwidth for wireless woftware upgrade.\n\nQ12. What kind of protocol (phy, mac, application layer protocol) do you want to use ?\n\nThere are many different technologies that claim to be the best for IoT. Some of them would already be available at your time of deployment, but some technologies would be being talked a lot but not available or not mature yet. So if your deployment schedule is very near, you would need to choose a technology that are mature right now.\n\nFor example, SKT deployed a Nation wide IoT service in South Korea around the end of 2016 based on LoRa technology. According to Ref [5], they were considering LoRa, SigFox, NB-LTE(and other LTE based IoT). SigFox were excluded for other reason, but between LoRa and SigFox, LoRa was selected mainly due to availability. LoRa technology was already there when they were planning, but there were still a couple of years to go for LTE based IoT to be mature enough.\n\n[3] NarrowBand IoT Demystified: What are the benefits and why do we need it?

The eNB can configure the UE to use UDC or not. If UDC is configured for a DRB, ROHC is not used for that DRB. One byte UDC header is introduced to indicate whether the PDCP PDU is compressed by UDC or not, whether the compression buffer is reset or not, and 4 validation bits of checksum to check whether the compression and decompression buffers are synchronous. For each DRB, at most 8192 bytes compression buffer is used. If there are some errors or failure due to buffer mismatching, the eNB can send an error notification control PDU to the UE, the UE may reset the compression buffer.\n\nTo improve compression efficiency of the first few packets, two types of pre-defined dictionary can be used for UDC. One is standard dictionary for SIP and SDP signalling as defined in RFC 3485, and another is operator defined dictionary. The eNB could configure whether or which dictionary is used for a UDC DRB.\n\nUDC related capabilities are also defined in UE capability. There are three capabilities: supporting basic UDC function; supporting standard dictionary and supporting operator defined capability. If the UE supporting operator defined capability, it should also report the version of the dictionary and the associated PLMN ID to assist the eNB to identify the dictionary stored by the UE. The eNB should configure UDC according to UE capabilities.\n\nReferences",

The process of directed retry involves the assignment of a Mobile Station to a radio channel on a cell other than the serving cell. This process is triggered by the assignment procedures, as described in 3GPP TS 48.008, and employs internal or external handover procedures as described in clauses 6 and 7. The successful procedure for a directed retry is as shown in figure 40 and as described below.\nIf during the assignment phase, as represented by the A-ASSIGNMENT-REQUEST message, a handover becomes necessary, due to either radio conditions or congestion, then the Mobile Station may be handed over to a different cell. When the decision has been made to handover the MS the BSS-A may send an A-ASSIGNMENT-FAILURE message, indicating 'directed retry', before sending the A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message to MSCA, indicating 'directed retry'. However BSS-A may alternatively send the A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message, indicating 'directed retry', without sending the A-ASSIGNMENT-FAILURE message. Other cause values may be used instead of \"Directed Retry\" in the A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message, this will allow the MSC to take different actions dependent on the received cause. Upon receipt of the A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message from BSS-A, then MSCA shall initiate the handover as described in clauses 6 and 7. No resources shall be cleared in the MSCA or BSS-A for this connection.\n\nAfter receipt of the A-HANDOVER-COMPLETE message from BSS-B the assignment procedure shall be considered to be complete and the resources on BSS-A shall be cleared.\nIf a failure occurs during the handover attempt, for example A-HANDOVER-FAILURE returned from BSS-A or BSS-B, then MSCA will terminate the handover to BSS-B. Under these conditions MSCA may optionally take one of a number of actions:\nThe procedures for Inter-MSC handover are also applicable to the directed retry process. If an Inter-MSC handover is necessary then the assignment process should be considered to have completed successfully upon receipt of the A-HO-COMPLETE included in the MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL request.",

The downlink DPCH can thus be seen as a time multiplex of a downlink DPDCH and a downlink DPCCH, compare subclause 5.2.1.\n\nFigure 9 shows the frame structure of the downlink DPCH. Each frame of length 10 ms is split into 15 slots, each of length Tslot = 2560 chips, corresponding to one power-control period.\n\nThe parameter k in figure 9 determines the total number of bits per downlink DPCH slot. It is related to the spreading factor SF of the physical channel as SF = 512/2k. The spreading factor may thus range from 512 down to 4.\n\nThe exact number of bits of the different downlink DPCH fields (Npilot, NTPC, NTFCI, Ndata1 and Ndata2) is given in table 11. What slot format to use is configured by higher layers and can also be reconfigured by higher layers.\n\nThere are basically two types of downlink Dedicated Physical Channels; those that include TFCI (e.g. for several simultaneous services) and those that do not include TFCI (e.g. for fixed-rate services). These types are reflected by the duplicated rows of table 11. It is the UTRAN that determines if a TFCI should be transmitted and it is mandatory for all UEs to support the use of TFCI in the downlink. The mapping of TFCI bits onto slots is described in [3].\n\nIn compressed frames, a different slot format is used compared to normal mode. There are two possible compressed slot formats that are labelled A and B. Slot format B shall be used in frames compressed by spreading factor reduction and slot format A shall be used in frames compressed by higher layer scheduling. The channel bit and symbol rates given in table 11 are the rates immediately before spreading.\n\nThe pilot bit patterns are described in table 12. The shadowed column part of pilot bit pattern is defined as FSW and FSWs can be used to confirm frame synchronization. (The value of the pilot bit pattern other than FSWs shall be \"11\".) In table 12, the transmission order is from left to right.\n\nIn downlink compressed mode through spreading factor reduction, the number of bits in the TPC and Pilot fields are doubled. Symbol repetition is used to fill up the fields. Denote the bits in one of these fields in normal mode by x1, x2, x3, …, xX. In compressed mode the following bit sequence is sent in corresponding field: x1, x2, x1, x2, x3, x4, x3, x4,…, xX,.\n\nThe relationship between the TPC symbol and the transmitter power control command is presented in table 13.\n\nMulticode transmission may be employed in the downlink, i.e. the CCTrCH (see [3]) is mapped onto several parallel downlink DPCHs using the same spreading factor. In this case, the Layer 1 control information is transmitted only on the first downlink DPCH. DTX bits are transmitted during the corresponding time period for the additional downlink DPCHs, see figure 10.\n\nIn case there are several CCTrCHs mapped to different DPCHs transmitted to the same UE different spreading factors can be used on DPCHs to which different CCTrCHs are mapped. Also in this case, Layer 1 control information is only transmitted on the first DPCH while DTX bits are transmitted during the corresponding time period for the additional DPCHs.",

The 10 ms message part radio frame is split into 15 slots, each of length Tslot = 2560 chips. Each slot consists of two parts, a data part to which the RACH transport channel is mapped and a control part that carries Layer 1 control information. The data and control parts are transmitted in parallel. A 10 ms message part consists of one message part radio frame, while a 20 ms message part consists of two consecutive 10 ms message part radio frames. The message part length is equal to the Transmission Time Interval of the RACH Transport channel in use. This TTI length is configured by higher layers.\n\nThe data part consists of 10*2k bits, where k=0,1,2,3. This corresponds to a spreading factor of 256, 128, 64, and 32 respectively for the message data part.\n\nThe control part consists of 8 known pilot bits to support channel estimation for coherent detection and 2 TFCI bits. This corresponds to a spreading factor of 256 for the message control part. The pilot bit pattern is described in table 8. The total number of TFCI bits in the random-access message is 15*2 = 30. The TFCI of a radio frame indicates the transport format of the RACH transport channel mapped to the simultaneously transmitted message part radio frame.

At most possible occasions for paging, no message arrives for the UE and the power the UE consumed could have been saved. This feature allows the eNB to send the UE a 'wake-up signal' (WUS) to instruct the UE that it has to monitor NPDCCH for paging, and otherwise allows the UE to skip the paging procedures. This allows the UE to potentially keep parts of its hardware switched off for more of the time, and save the power of decoding NPDCCH and NPDSCH for paging. Depending on how long the network allows for the UE to 'wake up' after receiving a WUS, the UE may be able to keep switched on only a receiver dedicated to WUS detection, allowing much of the UE's conventional hardware to remain in a very low-power state.\n\nScheduling request (FDD)\n\nIn Rel-13/14 NB-IoT, scheduling request (SR) exists only as a higher-layer procedure, which triggers a random access procedure to request sufficient UL resource to send a buffer status report (BSR). Rel-15 has added new, more resource and power efficient, ways to achieve this goal which can be configured by the eNB.\n\nFor a connected mode UE, eNB is able to configure by RRC periodic NPUSCH resources for the UE to send BSR, so the eNB is informed when pending traffic has arrived in the UE's buffer. The resources are activated and de-activated ('released') by dynamic signalling on NPDCCH.\n\nA connected mode UE is able to send, in the physical layer, a request to the eNB to be granted NPUSCH resources to send a BSR. This can be done either by a dedicated signal using a pre-configured NPRACH transmission, or via 'piggybacking' the request onto HARQ ACK or NACK transmission from the UE if one is available, by applying a cover code to the ACK or NACK symbols.\n\nEarly data transmission (FDD)\n\nAn idle mode UE is able to transmit data in Msg3 of the random access procedure, carrying between 328 and 1000 bits. After successful reception by eNB, the random access procedure terminates and the UE does not transition to connected mode. The UE requests a grant for EDT if its pending data is smaller than a maximum permitted size configured by eNB, by using a pre-configured set of NPRACH resources for its preamble transmission. The eNB can allow the UE to transmit a smaller amount of data than the maximum permitted size, in order to reduce the power spent transmitting padding bits.\n\nQuick release of RRC connection (FDD and TDD)\n\nA NB-IoT UE has to wait up to 10 seconds, after the receipt of the RRCConnectionRelease message, in case lower layers do not indicate successful acknowledgement of the reception. This feature allows that, in case the UE is not polled, the UE can consider the receipt of the RRCConnectionRelease message to be successfully acknowledged as soon as the UE has sent HARQ ACK. This feature was introduced from the Rel-14 specifications.\n\nRelaxed monitoring for cell reselection (FDD and TDD)\n\nThis feature allows much of the RRM monitoring to be avoided in cases where an NB-IoT UE is stationary and/or the network topology is not changing, and UE battery life can be correspondingly extended. The network configures the UE with a 'NRSRP delta' threshold, and while the change in RSRP its current cell is less than the threshold, the UE does not need to monitor neighbouring cells for 24 hours. This feature was introduced from the Rel-14 specifications.\n\nRLC UM (FDD and TDD)\n\nRel-15 adds support for RLC unacknowledged mode (UM) to complement the acknowledged mode (AM) and transparent mode (TM) introduced in Rel-13. This reduces the need to send RLC signalling over the air for IoT traffic which may be latency and/or loss tolerant, or recoverable by the application layer.\n\nNarrowband measurement accuracy improvement (FDD)\n\nThe narrowband secondary synchronization signal (NSSS) or, on the serving cell, transmissions of MIB-NB on the narrowband physical broadcast channel (NPBCH) can be used for making NRSRP measurements, as alternatives to using narrowband reference signals (NRS). NSSS and NPBCH use more resource elements for their transmission than NRS, and this should reduce the amount of subframes the UE needs to process to achieve a given measurement accuracy.\n\nNPRACH range enhancement (FDD)\n\nNB-IoT is sometimes deployed in cells with radius of up to around 100 km. Rel-13 NPRACH supports cell radii up to 40 km with unambiguous determination of UE range. Beyond that distance, because NPRACH is a pure sine wave transmission, there can be ambiguities for the eNB to determine the UE's range. A new NPRACH format is introduced with a subcarrier spacing of 1.25 kHz and a cyclic prefix of 800 μs, together with frequency hopping, which is sufficient to allow unambiguous range determination up to 120 km.\n\nSmall cell support (FDD and TDD)\n\neNB power classes are defined in NB-IoT to allow deployment of eNBs as microcells, picocells and femtocells, which use lower maximum transmit power than macro eNBs.\n\nReduced system acquisition time (FDD)\n\nIn FDD, when SIB1-NB is being transmitted with 16 repetitions (the maximum supported), eNB can transmit additional subframes containing SIB1-NB repetitions on anchor carriers and non-anchor carriers to allow faster decoding of SIB1-NB and reduce the UE's power consumption during cell access. Compared to Rel-13 which supports up to 8 SIB1-NB repetitions, Rel-15 allows 16 repetitions.\n\nUE differentiation (FDD and TDD)\n\nThe network is able to collect and store in the MME information about the UE and its traffic profile. This can be used to improve the scheduling of the UE according to e.g. its battery life or power supply, mobility, and when it tends to have traffic to transmit.\n\nAccess barring enhancement (FDD and TDD)\n\nIn Rel-13, the network can bar UEs at times of high load on a cell-specific basis. This feature allows UEs to be barred on a per-coverage level basis, so that UEs in deeper coverage levels and needing more repetitions of their transmissions, can be barred separately from other, less resource-intensive, UEs.\n\nMixed standalone operation (FDD)\n\nIn Rel-13, a standalone anchor or non-anchor NB-IoT carrier can only be configured together with another standalone carrier. This feature allows configuration of standalone anchor carriers with in-band and guard-band non-anchor carriers, and of in-band and guard-band anchor carriers with standalone non-anchor carriers. This allows small slices of non-LTE spectrum to be used as a standalone NB-IoT carrier and be linked with NB-IoT carriers associated to LTE spectrum.\n\nPower headroom reporting enhancement (FDD)\n\nIn Rel-13, power headroom reports (PHR) are made by the UE from one of two tables depending on coverage, each containing four entries. This feature improves the granularity of PHR transmitted in Msg3 to have 16 levels.\n\nTDD\n\nSupport for TDD is introduced, incorporating the Rel-13 NB-IoT feature together with Rel-14 features: UE category NB2, 2 UL/DL HARQ processes, multi-carrier RACH and paging, and OTDOA [1]. All LTE UL/DL subframe configurations are supported, except for configurations 0 and 6, and all LTE special subframe configurations are supported. In addition, some Rel-15 features described above are agnostic to FDD/TDD and thus can be used for both.",

Both CA within a frequency band (intra-band CA) and CA across frequency bands (inter-band CA) are supported. For the case of inter-band CA, CA with different numerologies, e.g., CA between NR carrier in FR1 and NR carrier in FR2, is also supported.\n\nNR newly defines the concept of bandwidth part (BWP). A UE can be configured with up to four BWPs per NR carrier for DL and UL, respectively. Each BWP has its own parameters including bandwidth and numerology. The bandwidth of the BWP is configured for each UE according to the UE capability on supported maximum bandwidth, and hence multiple UEs having different bandwidth capabilities can be served in a single wideband NR carrier. Also, multiple BWPs with different numerologies can be multiplexed within a single NR carrier to support different types of services. The bandwidth of the BWP can be narrower than the supported maximum bandwidth for the UE so that UE power saving is achieved.

EC-GSM-IoT improves the coverage performance of Cellular IoT devices by 20 dB compared to EGPRS along and enables long battery life time achieved by energy efficient methods over the radio interface. The extended coverage is achieved by a high number of blind physical layer transmissions along with modified channel coding schemes.\n\nIn Release 13, the base station supporting EC-GSM-IoT requires minimum 4 consecutive timeslot resources reserved for packet data operation to support extended coverage operation. Furthermore, the coverage improvement for low power EC-GSM-IoT devices with 23 dBm output power is limited to 10 dB in this release.\n\nIn Release 14, as part of radio interface enhancements, EC operation with a reduced number of 2 consecutive timeslot resources both on DL and UL specified. In addition, a new uplink coverage class CC5 is added to improve the MCL performance in uplink by 4 dB compared to Release 13, which can be mapped both to 4 and 2 consecutive time slot resources.\n\nIn Release 15, as part of further enhancements, a paging indication channel for EC operation is introduced as well as the deferred system information acquisition procedure for EC operation both targeting the improvement of energy consumption of the device in idle mode.

The AMF then sends a location services request to an LMF. The LMF processes the location services request which may include transferring assistance data to the target UE to assist with UE-based and/or UE-assisted positioning and/or may include positioning of the target UE. The LMF then returns the result of the location service back to the AMF (e.g., a position estimate for the UE.

Granting each quota causes some of the user's credit to be reserved at the Server. It is then possible that all the user's credit may be reserved when the user wishes to start using a new service. The new service may then be denied, despite the fact that there remains unused credit in the user's account.\n\nTo avoid such credit fragmentation and unnecessary load on the server, it is possible for multiple quotas provided to be linked into a credit pool. The client may then consider the quotas to form a single pool of credit, from which all services draw units.\n\nThe reference to a credit pool includes a translation factor derived from the rating parameter, which translates from units of a specific type (time/volume) to the abstract units in the pool.\n\nThe use of credit pooling is described in IETF RFC 4006 [402].",

    "context": "https://www.3gpp.org/specifications/specification-numbering/2044-spec-file-name-conventions\n\nSpec file name conventions\n\nThe filenames for TSs and TRs abide by a rigid convention. The filename consists of the spec number minus the dot after the second digit, followed by a hyphen, followed by three digits representing the version number. All files are stored compressed since this not only saves storage space (in most cases) and therefore speeds up downloads, but also serves to group the components of specs which are comprised of multiple files. Hence all specs have the file extension \".zip\".\n\nSince only one character space was originally available for each of the three components of the version number, these characters are coded in base 36.\n\nThe following table shows the rendering of numbers for the three-character version numbering system used by the vast majority of specs.\n\nHowever, for a very few specs in older Releases, there have been more than 35 technical versions. In these rare cases, the number of characters in the filename representing the version number has been extended from three to six, alotting two characters to each part of the version, coded as decimal numbers from 00 to 99. (There is no provision to cater for version fields values greater than 99.)\n\nThe alphabetic characters are case-insensitive, but conventionally are rendered in lower case.\n\nThus TR 21.900 v15.1.1 has a filename 21900-f11.zip containing 21900-f11.doc. And TS 24.229 v8.37.0 has a filename 24229-083700.zip containing 24229-083700.doc\n\nSpecs with more than one part have those parts identified by a number following the main spec number, separated by a hyphen. For example 51.010-1. Where there are more than nine parts, to ensure correct sort order of lists of specs, a leading zero is inserted where necessary to the part number, which then becomes two digits, for example 29.198-08.\n\nSome specs have parts with subparts, and the same convention applies: for example 29.998-06-2.\n\nThe spec number is a string rather than a number or a set of numbers, and in searches etc any leading zero must be entered if the spec is to be correctly identified. The convention is reflected in the spec document itself, and in its filename. Thus the filenames for these examples:\n\nThus TR 36.714-05-01 v0.7.0 has a filename 36714-05-01-070.zip containing 36714-05-01-070.doc.\n\nSome very long specs become unmanageable for maintenance when they consist of a single file, and are consequently split into several Word files. The filename of each bears a suffix which, when the files are sorted in alphanumeric order, indicates its place in the composite document. For example, TS 51.010-1, stored in file 51010-1-d80.zip, having around 10,000 pages, is composed of 30 Word files:\n51010-1-d80_cover.doc\n51010-1-d80_s00-s11doc\n51010-1-d80_s12-s13doc\n51010-1-d80_s14doc\n51010-1-d80_s15-s20doc\n...\n51010-1-d80_s80-90doc\n51010-1-d80_sAnnexes_Adoc\n51010-1-d80_sAnnexes_Bdoc\n\nSpecs are stored in Microsoft Word format with the extension .dot or .dotx. Some specs need additional, ancillary files. These can be in any format, for example .xlsx, .csv, .c, .h, .txt, etc according to the function of the file.\n\nAll files relating to a single spec are packed into a single .zip file, even if - as is the case for the majority of specs - the spec consists of only a single Word file.\n\nMaintenance history:\n2019-06-07: First issue, based on a free-standing page on conventions dating from 2012",

Similarly, to the E-SMLC in the LTE architecture (TS 36.305 [25]), the LMF either includes or has an interface to an SPC function, as defined in OMA SUPL V2.0 ([15], [16]). It can thus provide a consistent set of positioning methods for deployments utilizing both control-plane and user-plane.\n\nThe interworking does not enable use of user-plane signalling for part of a control-plane positioning session. The user plane in the interworking here is not intended as an alternative path for control-plane signalling that would be needed between UE and NG-RAN for mechanisms such as A-GPS in a standalone control-plane solution.\n\nThis interworking does enable the SPC to retrieve measurements (e.g., GNSS-to-RAN time relations) from the NG-RAN.\n\nThe underlying architecture is shown in Figure A.2-1 (TS 23.501 [2]). Note that, for interworking between user-plane and control-plane positioning, no new interfaces need to be defined as compared to those in the figure, assuming the SPC is either integrated in the LMF or attached to it with a proprietary interface.\n\nThe Lup and Llp interfaces shown in this architecture are part of the user-plane solution only and are not required for control-plane positioning.",

For the option without any specific QoS signalling flows, the standardized packet marking is applied, which informs the QoS enforcement functions what QoS to provide. The option with QoS-dedicated negotiation offers more flexibility and QoS support for finer granularity.

The procedure assumes that the serving AMF is aware of the regulatory service associated with the session (e.g. emergency session initiation - e.g. due to supporting an Emergency Registration procedure or assisting in establishing an emergency PDU Session).\n6.10.2\t5GC-MT-LR Procedure without UDM Query\nFigure 6.10.2-1 illustrates a location request for an emergency services session, where an emergency services client (e.g. a Public Safety Answering Point) identifies the target UE and the serving LRF using correlation information that was previously provided to it by the IMS Core. The signalling used to provide the correlation information to the PSAP is defined in TS 23.167. The correlation information may be used by the LRF to retrieve other information previously provided to it by the IMS Core and/or AMF as described for Figure 6.10.1-1. This allows the GMLC associated with the LRF to request a location from the AMF without needing to query the UDM of the target UE for the serving AMF address. This scenario therefore supports location of emergency sessions from roamers and USIM-less and other non-registered UEs, and requires that identifying information for the UE and AMF have been provided to the GMLC/LRF as described in clauses 6.10.1 and 6.10.3.\n\n6.10.3\tLocation continuity for Handover of an Emergency session from NG-RAN\nFigure 6.10.3-1 shows support for location continuity for handover of an emergency session from NG-RAN on the source side to either NG-RAN or another 3GPP RAN on the target side. The procedure applies when control plane location according to Figures 6.10.1-1 and 6.10.2-1 is used for location of the UE on the source side.

The location information for each MS is stored in functional units called location registers. Functionally, there are two types of location registers:\nSee also 3GPP TS 23.002 where the network architecture is described, and 3GPP TS 23.008 where the data stored in the location registers are described.\nThe action taken by a MS in order to provide location information to the PLMN will be referred to as location updating.\n2.2\tLocation area and MSC area\nThe MSC area is composed of the area covered by all base stations controlled by the MSC. An MSC area may consist of several location areas. A location area is an area in which, after having performed a location update once, MSs may roam without being required to perform subsequent location updates for reason of location change. A location area consists of one or more cells.\n\nFor further details of the network architecture, see 3GPP TS 23.002.\n2.3\tLocation area identification\nThe Location Area Identification (LAI) plan is part of the base station identification plan. The base stations are identified uniquely (see 3GPP TS 23.003).\n2.4\tIMSI detach/attach operation\nThe support of IMSI detach/attach operation is mandatory in MSs. The facility is optional in the fixed infrastructure of the PLMN.\n2.4.1\tExplicit IMSI detach/attach\nExplicit IMSI detach operation is the action taken by an MS to indicate to the PLMN that the station has entered an inactive state (e.g. the station is powered down). Explicit IMSI attach operation is the action taken by an MS to indicate that the station has re-entered an active state (e.g. the station is powered up).\n2.4.2\tImplicit IMSI detach\n\nImplicit IMSI detach operation is the action taken by the VLR to mark an MS as detached when there has been no successful contact between the MS and the network for a time determined by the implicit detach timer. The value of the implicit detach timer is derived from the periodic location updating timer; when the MSC/VLR applies Mobility Management Congestion Control to a MS, the MSC/VLR may need to adjust the Implicit Detach timer as specified in clause 3.7.2. During an established radio contact, the implicit detach timer shall be prevented from triggering implicit detach. At the release of the radio connection, the implicit detach timer shall be reset and restarted. Implicit IMSI detach shall also be performed in the case of a negative response to an IMEI check.\n2.5\tUse of the term mobile station (MS) in the present document\n\nIn order to simplify the text the term Mobile Station (MS) as used in relation to location management refers to the entity where the IMSI is stored, i.e., in card operated MSs the term Mobile Station (MS) refers to the card.\n2.6\tPaging area\nAs an option, and for paging optimization purpose, the VLR may control Paging Areas. A Paging Area (PgA) is composed of up to 5 Location Areas, and the MSC area is composed of several Paging Areas. Paging areas may overlap each other. The Paging Area is stored in the HLR and updated at each paging area change. The Paging Area is sent by the HLR to the VLR at roaming number request and may be used by the MSC/VLR for paging (e.g. when LAI is not known, after MSC/VLR restart) (see 3GPP TS 23.018 [5a]).",

As there is a 1:1 mapping between charging events and CDRs in event based charging, CDRs are created promptly after receiving and processing the event, and are then ready for transfer on to the CGF via the Ga reference point.\n\nIn session based charging, a CDR is opened when the initial charging event, specifying the start of a user session, is received. Information is added to the CDR upon receiving interim charging events. The CDR may be closed due to a number of reasons configured on the CDF or dependent on implementation, including but not limited to:\n\nThe CDR generation could be suppressed to limit the number of CDRs based on operator configuration.\n\nWhen a CDR is closed and the session is still active, a subsequent CDR is opened. Hence multiple \"partial CDRs\" may be needed to completely describe the session. This implies that opening and closure of CDRs may occur completely asynchronously to the reception of the charging events.\n\nThe size of partial CDRs could be optionally reduced by allowing a reduced format for partial CDRs, implying that some information can be eliminated rather than repeated in all the partial CDRs. This means that only changes from one CDR to the next, in addition to mandatory information, is reported. All the missing information can be reconstructed from fields in previous partial CDRs. For example, if location information is captured in CDRs but the user did not change location, the corresponding partial CDR would not include any location information.\n\nTherefore, two formats are considered for Partial CDRs:\n\nThe first CDR generated when a session is opened shall be a Fully Qualified Partial CDR. Subsequent partial CDRs may be Reduced Partial CDRs. Thus, the convention is that when any non-mandatory field is missing from a Reduced Partial CDR, it should be interpreted that the same field as in the previous partial CDR could be used. Refer to clause 5.4 for the definition of \"mandatory\" and other CDR field categories.\n\nAll CDFs and CGFs from all vendors shall be able to generate or receive Fully Qualified Partial CDRs. Generation and reception of Reduced Partial CDRs on the Ga interface is optional. However, if Reduced Partial CDRs are transmitted on the Ga interface they must comply with the rules specified in this clause.\n\nIf the CDFs are generating Reduced Partial CDRs on the Ga interface, the CGF must be able to convert the CDRs into Fully Qualified Partial CDRs. However, if according to operator choice, the BD can support Reduced Partial CDRs, no conversion to the Fully Qualified Partial CDR format is required.\n\nThe possible charging configurations that can be supported on both the Ga and the Bx interfaces are illustrated in figure 5.2.1.2.1. Configuration a) is the default arrangement that MUST be supported by all systems. The other configurations are optional and may be supported IN ADDITION to configuration a). Configuration b) illustrates the case where the CGF is converting Reduced to Fully Qualified Partial CDRs. Configuration c) depicts the case were Reduced Partial CDRs can be received in the BD and no conversion is needed.\n\nWhen a CDR is closed, it is immediately transferred to the CGF. The exact timing may be determined by configuration parameters of the protocol used on Ga. The CDF shall be capable of receiving and processing charging events and generating and forwarding the resulting CDRs in near real-time.\n\nDetails on the protocol application for the open Ga interface can be found in TS 32.295 [54]. The semantics and formal description of the CDR parameters are specified in TS 32.298 [51].",

This service component controls the transfer of the trace records from the NEFs to the OSF. The conceptual model is illustrated in figure 5, which employs both the event report function (CCITT X.734 [14]) and the log control function (CCITT X.735 [15]).\n\nThe trace control function collects traceable events within the NEF and formats them into trace records. These trace records may be stored locally within the NEF filestore or transferred to the OSF in the form of event reports. This is controlled by means of the \"priority\" indicator, which is a part of the trace type. If the \"priority\" indicator is not set then the trace records shall stored within the local filestore and subsequently transferred to the OSF in bulk via FTAM.\n\nIf a trace is activated with the \"priority\" indicator set then the trace records shall be sent to the OSF either direct by the trace control function or through Event Forwarding Discriminators (EFDs).\n\nIf EFDs are used then all trace records are offered to the EFDs. The EFDs determine which of the records are to be transmitted to the OSF in the form of event reports and the Operation System Id field in the header is ignored. The EDFs have complex filter constructs, which allow the operator to define the criteria for destinations and filters.\n\nIf EFDs are not used then all priority records are forwarded to the OSF whose address is given in the Operation System Id field. The NEF is required to supply additional information to provide the OS management application entity title.\n\nFinally, the trace records may also be stored in the form of log entries within the log of the NEF. It is up to the operator to decide if the log function is needed in parallel with the event reporting and file store. Once stored, the log records may be individually accessed by the OSF via the appropriate object management functions. Care should be taken of filter criteria for log records to avoid unnecessary overheads.\n\nThis service component contains the following groups of TMN management functions:\n\n9.2\tTransfer of Records\n\n9.2.1\tBulk record transfer\n\nThis group of TMN functions is concerned with the bulk transfer of trace records from the NEF record filestore to the OSF.\n\nThe trace records shall be transferred from the NEF to the OSF by the use of FTAM services. For further details of the use of FTAM see GSM 12.01 [8].\n\nIn addition to the simple file transfer services provided by FTAM, peertopeer application process communication may also be supported. The use of CMIS services for the uploading of files from the NEF to the OSF is specified in the GSM 12.00 [7].\n\nWhen the procedure defined in GSM 12.00 [7] and GSM 12.01 [8] are used to transfer the trace records, the file type shall be traceRecords and the format of the file is given by the type TraceFileFormat.\n\n9.2.2\tLog control\n\nThis function permits the trace record to be stored and retrieved from logs within the NEF. The logging of these records is performed in accordance with the log control function specified in CCITT X.735 [15] and no additional management functions are required.\n\n9.2.3\tLog access\n\nThis TMN function controls the access to the log described above. Each log defined may contain one or more log entries. Each log entry contains a single trace record.\n\nFor further details concerning the use of logs, see CCITT X.735 [15].\n\nThe following system management functions are required:\n\n9.2.4\tEvent Reporting\n\n9.2.4.1\tEvent Forwarding Discriminators\n\nFor shortterm recording of tracing events and for more complicated filter conditions the event forwarding discriminator construct defined in CCITT X.734 [14] and CCITT X.721 [13] can be employed. The event forwarding discriminator construct is extremely flexible permitting the combination of a number of fields and logical operations with a wide variety of scheduling options. The EFD also controls the destinations to which the event reports are sent. Several such filters may be defined and scheduled for operation at different times and for different time periods.\n\nThe following system management functions are required:\n\n9.2.4.2\tDirect Transfer by Trace Control Function\n\nThis function permits the NEF to transmit trace records direct to the OSF. In general the trace record shall be sent on completion of the call or the traceable event. This function is controlled by means of the \"priority\" indicator, which is contained in the trace type. If the priority indicator is not set, then the trace records shall be stored on file within the NE filestore. These records may be subsequently collected via bulk record transfer as described in subclause 9.2.1. If the trace type specified on activation includes the \"priority\" indicator then all of the records shall be sent via trace reports to the OSF specified by the operation system id.\n\nThe following system management functions are required:",

Upon detection of a valid PDCCH, the device follows downlink control information contained in the PDCCH, e.g., the scheduling decision so that the device receives PDSCH (or transmits PUSCH) accordingly.\n\nThe PDCCHs are transmitted in one or more control resource sets (CORESETs). A CORESET spans overone, two or three OFDM symbol(s) in time domain and over a configurable bandwidth in the frequency domain. This is needed in order to handle devices with different bandwidth capabilities and also beneficial from a forward-compatibility perspective. One control channel element (CCE) is defined as 6 resource element groups (REGs), where 1 REG is composed of 12 resource elements (REs). In a CORESET, a PDCCH with DM-RS can be mapped on one or more CCEs as shown in Figure 5.5.4.5-1. Different number of CCEs (aggregation level) provides different coding rate for the control channels.\n\nThere are different formats for DCI transmitted on a PDCCH as shown in Table 5.5.4.5-1. A UE monitors one or more PDCCH candidates for DCI with CRC scrambled by a certain RNTI in PDCCH common search space (CSS) set and/or UE-specific search space (USS) set. DCI format is distinguished by the PDCCH payload size and the RNTI scrambling the CRC.\n\nPDSCH is used to transmit one or two transport blocks (TBs). A DCI in a PDCCH can assign a PDSCH transmission with DM-RS (and other RS if any). The PDSCH is decoded based on the information in the PDCCH, for example, time/frequency-domain resource, modulation, and layer. PDSCH transmissions are processed with durations from 2 to 14 symbols. The number of layers for PDSCH transmissions is 8. HARQ feedback/retransmission is supported for PDSCH transmissions as mentioned in Section 5.5.4.7.",

The vertical separations are the Ressource Blocks (RB), as defined in the previous section, i.e. a group of 12 subcarriers. The horizontal separations are the OFDM symbols. Four OFDM symbols together with 20 RBs form a so-called \"SS/PBCH (Synchronization Signals/ Physical Broadcast Channel) block\".\n\nThe PSS and NSS are transmitted over 127 subcarriers, i.e. about 10.5 RBs. (They are designed to carry the Physical Cell ID (PCID) selected from 1008 candidates.)\n Once synchronised with the PSS and NSS, the mobiles can retrieve the full SS/PBCH structure, and thus \"listen\" to the Physical Broadcast Channel (PBCH) and its associated Demodulation reference signals (DM-RS).\n\nThe PBCH carries only the minimum system information necessary for initial access, such as system frame number (SFN), initial configurations for PDCCH, PDSCH and DM-RS, and information required to determine the frame timing such as SS/PBCH block index and half-frame index. These are referred to as \"System Information Block 1 (SIB1)\".\n\nOne or multiple SS/PBCH blocks can be transmitted by using transmission beamforming within a half frame, with configurable periodicity from 5 ms to 160 ms. The maximum number of SS/PBCH blocks and the applicable subcarrier spacing for SS/PBCH block transmission are dependent on the frequency range, as shown in Table 5.5.4.3-1. They can be identical or different from the subcarrier spacing used for other DL transmissions.\n\nSIB1 and other system information (SIB2 and onwards) are carried by PDSCH which is scheduled by PDCCH. SIB1 contains necessary information to perform random access procedure for initial access.\n\nPaging message is carried by PDSCH which is scheduled by PDCCH. Numerology used for SIB1 transmission on a NR cell is indicated in master information block (MIB) carried by PBCH and is commonly applied to transmissions for other system information (SIB2 and onwards), Paging, Msg.2 (\"Message 2\", as explained below) and Msg.4 transmissions on the same cell.\n\nFor random access in NR, a four-step procedure consisting of Msg.1, Msg.2, Msg.3 and Msg.4 is defined. For Msg.1 i.e., PRACH transmission in random access, NR supports two types of PRACH sequences as the preamble sequence:\n\nFour different PRACH preamble formats based on the long ZC sequence are defined and corresponding numerology is defined for each PRACH preamble format as shown in Table 5.5.4.3-2.\n\nIn addition, nine different PRACH preamble formats based on the short ZC sequence are defined and corresponding numerology is defined for each PRACH preamble format as shown in Table 5.5.4.3-3.\n\nMsg.2 and Msg.4 for random access are carried by PDSCH that are scheduled by PDCCH.\n\nMsg.3 for random access is carried by PUSCH which is scheduled by random access response (RAR) in Msg.2 or PDCCH in case of retransmission.\n\nFor mobility measurement, SS/PBCH block and/or CSI-RS can be utilized in NR. SS/PBCH block based reference signal received power (RSRP), reference signal received quality (RSRQ) and signal-to-noise and interference ratio (SINR) are defined, and CSI-RS based RSRP, RSRQ and SINR are also defined. For radio link monitoring (RLM), SS/PBCH block and/or CSI-RS can be utilized as RLM reference signal in NR. One or multiple SS/PBCH blocks and/or CSI-RS resources are configured to be monitored to evaluate whether the radio link is in-sync status (i.e., in good quality) or out-of-sync status.",

    "context": "https://www.sharetechnote.com/html/Handbook_LTE_Fading.html\n\nComm. Tech.: Fading\n\nIntuitive understanding of Fading would be simple, but the detailed description is pretty difficult and would be even more difficult to understand the details without going through the complicated mathematical process. This page would start with Intuitive description and try to keep adding the details one by one. It will take long time to complete the pages and will split this into multiple pages if it goes too long.\n\nIn most of the wireless communication environement, a signal out of a transmitter radiate into wide direction and these radiated signal takes different path and arriving at the reciever at different timing and with different signal strength(amplitude). As a result, the signal coming into the reciever is the composite of all the components. As you may learned in high school physics, when thetwo\ncopies of the signal get combined the resulting signal can be an augmented signal or attenuated signal depending on whether the two signal constructively combined or destructively combined.\n\nThen what determines whether the signals constructively combine or destructively combine ? The answer also come from high school physics. The phase of the two signal determines whether the signal constructively combine or destructively combine.\n\nIn wireless communication environment, many copies of the signals get combined at the reciever side and some of them constructively combines and some of them destructively combines. So final result of combination of all the incoming signals become very complicated and the combined signal becomes drastically different from the original signal tranmitted from the source. In most case, the quality\nof the combined signal at the reciever gets poorer (deteriorated) than the original signal. This kind of process of signal deterioration by the multiple propogation path of a signal is called 'Fading'. When we say \"Fading\", it usually implies \"Signal quality gets bad\".\n\nFor more intuitive unerstanding of the fading, I will show you a couple of different aspect of fading you can mesure using various equipments.\n\nFirst, let's compare a faded signal and non-faded signal using a spectrum analyzer. You would get the two results as follows and you will see the highly fluctuating amplitude across the channel bandwidth. (Note : These two capture are not the one from the same signal, so comparing the absolute value of the amplitude does not make any sense. Just take the image of overall amplitude profile).\n\nNow let's look at how the fading influence the signal quality decoded by the reciever. Look at the following samples of constellation for faded and non-faded signal.\n\nNow let's get into even further and I think this is the thing that you would be most interested in. How this fading would influence the final performance. Following graph shows the data rate at PHY layer and PDCP layer. The plot showing at the top (labeled as 'PHY Transmission Rate') is the amount of data being transmitted per second by PHY layer of the transmitter. The plot in the middle\n(labeled as 'PHY throughput with HARQ ACK' is the amount of data getting ACKED per second from the reiever PHY layer. You see there is pretty much gap between the two plots. It means that a considerable portions of the data were failed to get properly decoded by the reciever and the reciever sent NACK for the data. Normally in this case, the transmitter PHY layer retransmits the previous data rather than moving into the next step of the transmission.\n\nThe plot at the bottom (labelled as 'PDCP Transmission Rate') is the amount of data being sent to the lower layer from the transmitter's PDCP layer. You will see another gap here. It is not easy to explain exactly what is causing this gap. In this case, some portions of the gap would come from the overhead of higher layer data structure but majority of the gap would be because PDCP cannot\npush the data down to the lower layer since PHY layer is too busy with retransmitting the previous data rather than transmitting the new data coming from the higher layer.\n\nThere are many factors generating Fading effect. Followings are the list of components (factors) of fading we can think of.\n\nTo study on fading requires the detailed understanding of each of these components. If I express some major components in visual form, it can be presented as follows. Just from the high level view, you should see some typtical pattern from this representation. First notice that the horizontal axis represents 'Distance in Linear Scale'. You may have seen a lot of different plots in various\ntextbook and get confused by those. One of the first step to remove those confusion would be clearly understanding the meaning of axis of the graph. Even for the same things, you would see different shape of plots if you define the meaning of the axis differently. One of the factors from various text confusing you the most is the scale of each axis. For example, in case of path loss graph in some textbook where they represent the axis in log scale you would see a straight line, but in this page you\nare seeing a kind of negative exponential graph since the axis is represented in linear scale.\n\nPath loss is just gradually decreases but not much of fluctuation. In the second plot, you see some fluctuation of the signal strength but the fluctuation frequency over the distance is not that high. In the third plot, you see fluctuations of signal strength and the fluctuation frequency is also pretty high.\n\nWhen you observe a real received signal, you wouldn't see these factors in separate form as in the graph on the left side. What you see at the real reciever is the result of summation of all the factors and it is like the graph on the right side.\n\nProbably the words you might have heard the most frequently when you talking about fading would be 'Fast Fading', 'Slow Fading'. Intuitively it sounds simple. But not easy to find clear/technical defintion for these. How fast it should be to be Fast Fading ? How slow it should be to be Slow Fading ?\n\nI found a very good definition and technical explanation from the reference [2]. It states as follows:\n\nFast Fading is used to describe channels in which Channel Coherence Time < Tansmission Symbol Time. Fast Fading describes a condition where the time duration in which the channel behaves in a correlated mannel is short compared to the time duration of a symbol. Therefore, it can be expected that the fading characteristic of the channel will change several times while a symbol is propagating, leading to distortion of the baseband pulse shape. Analogous to the distortion described as ISI, the distortion take place because the recieved signal's components are not all highly correlated throughout time. Hence, fast fading can cause the baseband pulse to be distorted, resulting in a loss of SNR that often yields an irreducible error rate. Such distorted pulses cause synchronization problems (failure of phase-locked-loop recievers), in addition to difficulties in adequately defining a matched filter.\n\nSlow Fading is used to describe channels in which Channel Coherence Time > Tansmission Symbol Time. Here, the time duration that the channel behaves in a correlated manner is long compared to the time duration of a transmission symbol. Thus, one can expect the channel state to virtually remain unchanged during the time in which a symbol is transmitted. The propaging symbols will likely not suffer from the pulse distortion. The primary degradation in a slow-fading channel, as with flat fading, is loss in SNR.\n\nPath Loss and Shadowing may not be considered to be a part of Fading in narrow sense, but it can be considered as a factor causing the fading in wider sense. Understanding or Modeling the path loss is not that difficult. You may see a mathematical model which you were faimilar with in your high school math. The famous format of anti-proportional to 'something squared'.\n\nModling for Path Loss is done with the respect to the distance between a transmitter and receiver. The key question is ..\n\nTest A) When a transmitter antenna is transmitting a certain (fixed) amount of energy and you put a measurement antenna which is a certain distance (let's call this distance as 'd') and measure the received(measured) energy. Once you get the value at a certain 'd', write down the value. And then move the reciever antenna a little bit further and do the same measurement and write down\nthe value. Repeat this process as you move 'd' further and further and collect all the measured value and plot it on the graph with horizontal axis = d and vertical axis = measured energy level (power). How would the plot look like ? Can you come up with an equation to represent the graph ?\n\nTest B) Now let's try a little bit different type of measurement. This time, draw a circle with radius d with the transmitter antenna at the center. and then put several antenna along the circumference and measure the received power at each antenna and plot the value with horizontal axis = location of receiver antenna and vertical axis = measured energy level (power). How would the\nplot look like ?\n\nTest C) Now let's think about two test environment. In one setup there is no obstacles between the reciever and transmitter antenna (Let's call this as 'Setup A'). In the other setup, there are a lot of obstacles (like building, tree, houses, mountain etc) between the transmitter antenna and reciever antenna (Let's call this as 'Setup B'). Then you do the measurement described in Test\nB) for both setup and compare the result. Would you see any difference ? what kind of difference would you see ?\n\nThese three test will be used as a basis for modeling following cases. (Details will come later)\n\nThe first thing we can think of is a kind of ideal case called 'Free Space'. In this case, we assume that there is no obstacles between the transmitter and reciever antenna.\n\nIn this case, the measured power at every reciever antenna at the same distance from the transmitter antenna would be same and the received signal power can be modeled as follows. (Basically this equation is a form of Frris' Transmission Equation )\n\nIf you want to convert this equation to a form which most of RF engineers are more familiar with (dBm scale), you can just apply 10 log( ) on both side and go through following steps. Of course, you don't have to memorize the each of these steps. Just try to understand overall concept and logic of this process.\n\nLife would be much easier if the condition between the transmission antenna and reciever antenna is always as decribed in previous case (Free Space).\n\nIn real life situation, it is highly likely that you would see a lot of obstacles (like building, Tree, mountain etc). If I draw this situation in a little bit simplified way, it would be as follows.\n\nThe path loss at a certain distance can be expressed as follows. Compare this with the free space case. What kind of difference do you see ?\n\nIn case of free space model, once the distance is determined the received power can be determined automatically meaning that if d is fixed(same), you would get the same measured value (recieved power) for every measurement. But in this case, you cannot gurantee the same measured value even though the distance is same. Even though d is same, you would get the different measured value if beta\n(Path Loss Exponent) is different or epsilon (Random Variable) is different.\n\nThen the question would be 'How the Path Loss Exponent and Random Variable is determined ?'. There is no strict theory that can determine these values deterministically. It is usually determined empirically. According to various researches,\n\nIf you apply Log (10 log[ ] more specifically) to both side, you can get a linear equation in dB (dBm) scalse as shown below.\n\nA defining characteristic of the mobile wireless channel is to build up a mathematical model for the variations of the channel strength over time and over frequency. There are mainly two factors influencing the variations of the channel strength as listed below.\n\nAs a starting point, please... please ... please ... read very carefully about the section of Signal Presentation, Impulse Response and Convolution section before you go deeper into this section.\n\nLet's suppose we have a case as shown below. A UE is communicating with a eNodeB and there is a lot of building between the UE and the eNodeB. You may intuitively guess the eNodeB would get the multiple copies of the same signal from UE because the same signal can reach the eNodeB via multiple path as shown below. Let's assume that we have four different path as shown below. There are two\nmajor characteristics of the paths. One is attenuation and the other one is time delay. Of course there would be several additional factors, but these two components would be the largest factors. Let's assume that each of the path has the delay and attenuation as shown below.\n\nHow do we represent a channel using these delay and attenuator factor ? There can be a couple of different ways to represent it, but one of the most common way would be to represent it as an impulse response model. Even though you may not familiar with the term 'impulse response', you may have seen this kind of description if you have any experience of using channel simulators (fader) and\ndealt with fading profile. Following is the graphical representation of impulse response of the four paths in this example and physical meaning of it. I hope this make sense to you.\n\nIf you represent this impulse response into a mathematical form, it become as follows. If you are not familiar with this kind of mathematical representation. Read again the section of Signal Representation. (When you are first learning this way of signal representation.. you may think .. what the hell is delta function\n? Why we need this kind of function ? etc... this is one example why you need to learn those textbook concept).\n\nLet's look into a example that (hopefully) would give you more concrete understanding of these concepts.\n\nLet's suppose that a signal goes through six different path (multipath) as indicated in plot (1). Horizontal axis represents the time delay from the transmission to arrival at the reciever antenna. Vertical axis indicates the amplitude of the received signal. plot(2)~(7) shows the signal going through each path reaching to Rx antenna. If you look at each plots, you would notice that the phase\n(time delay) and amplitude are different from each other. plot (8) shows the summation of all the plots from (2) through (6). This is the signal being sensed by the recieving antenna.\n\nWhat do you observe from the plot (8) (the sum of all the multipath signal) ? You would notice that the amplitude and phase gets different from the transmitted signal, but overall shape of the signal is same as the transmitted signal. It means that no distortion happened by this multipath.\n\nNow let's think of how the received signal is influenced by the multipath with the frequency of the transmitted signal. I created plots for three different frequency (In this case, the amplitude of transmitted signal are same for all frequencies). As you see at plot (8) of each case (w=1,2,5), the amplitude of the total received signal gets different depending on frequency.\n\nNote : This shows the cases of only three different frequencies. Isn't there any way of showing the amplitude of total received signal for all the different frequencies in easier way ? We will look into this shortly.\n\nFollowing is the Octave source code (I think this would work with Matlab as well) for the graphs shown above, try playing the list 'a' and 'tau', get some intuitive understanding on your own.\n\nplot(t,real(exp_iwt)); xlim([0 2]);ylim([-1 1]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[-1 0 1]);\n\nplot(t,imag(exp_iwt)); xlim([0 2]);ylim([-1 1]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[-1 0 1]);\n\nplot(t,real(exp_iwt_sum),'r-'); xlim([0 2]);ylim([-3 3]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[-3 0 3]);\n\nplot(t,imag(exp_iwt_sum),'r-'); xlim([0 2]);ylim([-3 3]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[-3 0 3]);\n\nplot(w,real(Hw)); xlim([0 wmax]);ylim([-1 1]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[-1 0 1]);\n\nplot(w,imag(Hw)); xlim([0 wmax]);ylim([-1 1]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[-1 0 1]);\n\nplot(w,abs(Hw)); xlim([0 wmax]);ylim([0 1]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[0 1]);\n\nplot(w,real(Hw_sum),'r-'); xlim([0 wmax]);ylim([-5 5]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[-5 0 5]);\n\nplot(w,imag(Hw_sum),'r-'); xlim([0 wmax]);ylim([-5 5]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[-5 0 5]);\n\nplot(w,abs(Hw_sum),'r-'); xlim([0 wmax]);ylim([0 5]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[0 5]);\n\nNow we have a channel described in the form of impulse response. Let's suppose that we have a signal x(t) going through the channel. The x(t) will split into multiple pathes in the channel and take the different route and finally recombine at the receiver antenna. What would the signal at the receiving antenna look like ? There is an excellent mathematical tool to give you the answer to this\nquestion. It is a tool called 'Convolution'. If you just take the convolution of channel impulse response and input signal (x(t)), you would take the signal at the receiving antenna.\n\nWhen we specify a Fading Channel profile, we are usually given a table with tap delay and relative power for each tap. You may visualize the table as shown below. Usually those profile table in the specification does not specify statistical information for the tap, but usually some specific statistical profile is associated with each tap. In case of LTE channel profile (Tap Delay Line : TDL), usually each tap is associated with statistical power profile as shown below. Usually the first tap indicates the fading on line of sight path that is modeled in Rician distribution and the remaining taps indicates the fading channel on non line of sight path that is modeled in Rayleigh distribution.\n\nWhen it comes to using this channel profile in fading implementation, I would take this as the impulse response of the fading channel. Then, the modeling of a signal passing through a fading channel can be represented as the convolution of signal and the fading channel as illustrated below.\n\nSound simple ? Yes simple conceptually, but there is a difficulties in reality. It is about how to apply the statistically property associated with each tap.\n\nEach tap is associated with a specific statistical power and doppler profile. It mean that the power for each tap for each steps of convolution changes and the frequency shift for each tap for each steps of convolution changes according to specific statistical profile as illustrated below.\n\nApplying these changing impulse response, the faded signal is generated as illustrated below. (In real implementation, there are various techniques are used to generate this kind of varing channel impulse response. One widely used mathology is to use Jake's model).\n\nIn addition to this delay, gain, PDF, we have to think about the correlations among all the antenna on transmitter and reciever side as follows.\n\nThese correlation is defined in 3GPP as shown below and this correlation matrix should be applied to the Fading model when we use multiple antenna configuration.\n\nDo you see any difference between the matrix shown above (channel matrix) for 2 x 2 MIMO and the correlation matrix as shown below for 2 x 2 case ?\n\nOne obvious difference is size of the matrix. The channel matrix shown above is 2x2 matrix and the correlation matrix for 2 x 2 case shown below is 4x4.\n\nAny idea on how the 2x2 matrix show above is converted to 4 x 4 matrix shown below ?\n\n(The full correlation matrices is obtained by Tensor Product/Kronecker product\nof two antenna correlation matrix)\n\nLet's start with the simplest case and add piece by piece until we reach more realistic (complex) cases.\n\nLet's suppose that you have two Tx antenna and one Rx antenna. If draw this situation as in channel model, you can draw this setup as follows. (Let's call this a Case A)\n\nIn this setup, you have two channel path(channel coefficient) h1 and h2. Now let's think about all the possible relation between these two channel. If you draw all the possible relationships as a diagram, you may represent as follows.\n\nIf you represent these relationship between the two channel path (channel coefficient) in a matrix format, you can represent it as follows. (I would not explain it in detail but you would need to have some intuitive understanding of vector/matrix. This is why you should have taken such a boring linear algebra course in the university. If you are really new to this vector/matrix concept,\nVector/Matrix page on this site). Be careful, you may get confused with 2 x 2 matrix to be used to model 2 x 2 MIMO channel. (At least I was confused a lot at the beginning. I would not talk too much about it, but I strongly recommend you to compare the two matrix and clearly understand the difference between them). Just to give you the conclusion about the difference between the two matrix, the matrix shown\nhere represents the correlation between each channel path(the path the signal flow through) and the matrix shown in channel model represents the correlation between Tx and Rx antenna.\n\nThe 'Beta' value represents the cross correlation between channel coefficient h1 and h2.\n\nNow we have a different case. In this case, you have two Tx antenna and one Rx antenna. If draw this situation as in channel model, you can draw this setup as follows. (Let's call this a Case B)\n\nIf you represent these relationship between the two channel path (channel coefficient) in a diagram, you can represent it as follows.\n\nIf you represent these relationship between the two channel path (channel coefficient) in a matrix format,, you can represent it as follows.The 'Alpha' value represents the cross correlation between channel coefficient h1 and h2.\n\nNow let's look into more complicated case. In this case, you have two transmitter antenna and two reciever antenna. The antenna and channel path can be illustrated as follows. You can think of this as a combination of Case A and Case B described above.\n\nNow if you represents the correlations between each of these channel coefficients, it can be represented as follows.\n\nAs you did in case A and B, if you represents these correlations in vector/matrix format, you would get a big matrix as follows. How did you get the last matrix ?. Actually it came from the matrix for Case A and B described above. If you clearly understood the meaning of Beta and Alpha in Case A and B, you would easily understand how each of the elements in this big matrix can be represented\nas 'Alpha' or 'Beta'.\n\nwhat about the '?' part shown above ? Filling out these '?' is not so straigtforward. If you brow the statical concept (I cannot explain though :)), those parts are the places where the correlation between part of Case A and part of Case B and can be filled as follows.\n\nHow to derive MIMO coeifficient matrix mathematically from Diversity coefficient matrix ?\n\nI have explained how we got 2x2 MIMO correlation matrix from physical perspective and the each elements of 2 x 2 MIMO matrix can be derived from the elements of 2x1 Diversity matrix. I strongly recommend you to try to get familiar with this concept and build your own intuition. But as the number of antenna increases, deriving all the correlation matrix as I described above would not be that\neasy. Fortunately there is a mathematical way of deriving the MIMO correlation matrix from Diversity Correlation matrix. The MIMO correlation matrix can be derived by taking Kronecker product of two Diversity matrix as shown below. (If you are not familar with the concept of Kronecker product, refer to this page)\n\nThe last component I want to show you about Fading is Doppler spread. Doppler spread is caused by the well known phenomenon called 'Doppler Shift' (I would not explain what Doppler shift is. Everybody would learned about this from High school physics and you can easily google out a lot of explanation of this effect).\n\nDoppler spread can be expressed as shown in following function and plot. If you think of 'Doppler spread' as a kind of filter (or a block in a control system model). You can take the following function as a kind of transfer function of the filter.\n\nAs you see, how much a frequency (fc) get spreaded by doppler spread is indicated by fm. If you see another formula below the graph representing fm, you would see fm is determined by the velocity of object (relative velocify between transmitter and reciever) and speed of light and fc(carrier frequency). You know fc is constant (set by standard and assume hardware is good enough to maintain\nthe fc the same). Now the only variable is the speed v. According to this equation, fm and v are in proportional relation, meaning if v gets higher, fm gets larger (the width of the graph gets wider) and if v gets smaller, fm gets smaller (the width of the graph gets narrower).\n\nHow this kind of plot is obtained ? What is the meaning of this plot. Let's think a little bit further into how we get this plot.\n\nLet's assume that a car (e.g, a phone in a car) is moving in horizontal direction and it is receiving a signal with an angle illustrated as in (A). Since the car is moving, the phone in the car would experience doppler shift. Since the UE is getting the signal with an angle, the doppler shift it percieves can be represented as in red arrow in (B).\n\nNow let's extend this situation further to the situation where the UE in the moving car is receiving the signal from all direction as illustrated below. This is the situation where the UE has so many reflectors around it and recieves the multipath signal all around. Then the doppler shift that UE percieves is like red dots marked on the horizontal line. If you plot those red dots in probability distribution function, you will get the red plot as shown below.\n\nNow you may have question. How differently the narrow Doppler spread and wide doppler spread affect on the signal ?\n\nThe simulation result for these two cases (narrow and wide doppler spread) is shown below. The upper track is for narrow doppler spread and the lower track is for wide doppler spread. As you see, you see much frequency energy fluctuation over time in wide Doppler spectrum. I will update the page later about the mathmatical background.\n\nIf you are using a phone in high speed train, the distance between UE and eNB changes very fast. It means both UE and eNB will be under drastic doppler shift.\n\nFor example, let's suppose the train is traveling right into the eNB as illustrated below (the eNB is right on top of the railway). Of course, you don't see this kind of situation in real life. The train will crash into the eNB in this case. However, just suppose this is possible and train can go through a ghost-like eNB. In this case and assume that the speed of the train is constant, the doppler shift will stay constant as well. The only change is the direction of frequency shift changes as the train pass through eNB as illustrated below.\n\nHowever, in realy you don't see any case shown above in real life. In real life, the eNB is located away from the rail way at certain distance.\n\nIn this case, the Doppler Shift changes as the train get closer to, pass by and farther away from the eNB. The doppler shift at a specific time is represented as shown below (36.101 B.3)\n\nWhere does this equation come from ? It turned out to be from hunior high school geometry, but it took me long time to understand this since there is no background information in 3GPP.\n\nThis model is based on the assumption that the eNBs are spaced equaly and the train moves at a constant speed. It is also assumed that the initial location of the train (the location at t = 0) on the railway is at the mid point between two adjacent eNBs as shown below. Dmin is defined as the closest possible distance between UE and eNB and the initial location is specified to be half way between two adjacent eNBs. Then, the distance between the eNB and the train can be derived. If we define the angle theta as shown below, the cos(theta) will become as below.\n\nNow let's look into a snapshot after t seconds. Now the location of the train on the railway and the distance between UE and eNB, and the cos(theta) is derived as shown below. (Just try to derive on your own or just copy it with a pen on a paper, you will understand it clearly).\n\nIf you plot the doppler shift with time as traing travel along the railway, it would be illustrated as shown below.\n\nFollowing is the Matlab code that I wrote based on the equation shown above. In this, I calculated not only frequency shift but also the angle(theta) to figure out the location of the train more easily.\n\nNow let's do some experiment with the code to understand the impact of the parameters. The first experiment is to change the speed of the train keeping all other parameters same. The doppler shift that UE (on the train) will experience can be plotted as shown below. See if this is aligned with your intuitive understanding.\n\nNow let's do another experiement. In this experiement, I changed Dmin keeping all other parameters same. The doppler shift that UE (on the train) will experience can be plotted as shown below. See if this is aligned with your intuitive understanding.\n\nTypical model for Fading channel can be described by a simple diagram as follows. This is very simplified model but fortunately this is almost enough for 3GPP specification for fading test. As you see, a signal comes into the fading block and splits into multiple path. Each path has three components, namely Delay, PDF, Gain component. By changing these parameters in each path,\nyou can construct pretty complicated fading channel.\n\nIn LTE 3GPP specification, typical three types of Fading profiles are defined as follows.\n\nGo through following pages (examples) and try to get some intuitive understanding on your own.\n\n[2] Rayleigh Fading Channels in Mobile Digital Communication Systems.

This shall be performed immediately after the successful completion of the Relocation Resource Allocation procedure.\n\nIn a network implementing the \"Flexible Iu interface for handover/relocation\" option, in the Intra-3G_MSC handover/relocation case, 3G_MSC-B may optionally use a global title based on the Global RNC-Id for the addressing of the Iu interface messages towards the target RNC.\nIf AoIP is supported by 3G_MSC-B and BSS, then the BSS or the 3G_MSC-B may initiate a \"BSS Internal Handover with MSC Support\" as described in detail in subclause 6.3.\nIf AoIP is supported and no transcoder is inserted in the BSS, then 3G_MSCB shall provide transcoder resources.\nFor subsequent inter-MSC handover/relocation to an area where \"Intra Domain Connection of RAN Nodes to Multiple CN Nodes\" is applied, 3G_MSC-B can have multiple target CN nodes for each handover target in a pool-area as specified in 3GPP TS 23.236.\n\nThe role of 3G_MSCB is also to provide transcoder resources.

If there is no subscription data for this CSG ID or the CSG subscription for the CSG ID has expired, 3G_MSC-B considers the membership check as failed.\nFor subsequent handover/relocation of an emergency call to a CSG cell, 3G_MSC-B shall skip the CSG membership check and proceed with the handover/relocation procedure.\n\nFor subsequent inter-PLMN handover/relocation to a CSG cell, if the anchor MSC-A or 3G_MSC-A provided a CSG ID list for the target PLMN during the basic inter-MSC handover/relocation, 3G_MSC-B shall validate the CSG membership of the UE in the target CSG cell using the CSG ID list for the target PLMN.\nBased on operator's configuration, if the anchor MSC-A or 3G_MSC-A provided only a CSG ID list for the PLMN of 3G_MSC-B, the 3G_MSC-B may allow the handover/relocation by validating the CSG membership of the UE in the target CSG cell using this CSG ID list. Otherwise, 3G_MSC-B shall reject the handover/relocation due to no CSG subscription information of the target PLMN-ID available.",

    "context": "https://www.sharetechnote.com/html/Handbook_UMTS_eCall.html\n\n2G/3G: eCall\n\nWhat is 'eCall' ? In other words, you may ask 'what does the letter 'e' stands for ? Does it mean 'emergency' ? or 'electronic' ? or something else ?\n\nEven though I haven't seen any formal documents that explicitely defines the letter 'e' in eCall, I think it would not be wrong if you say the 'e' mean 'emergency', i.e, 'eCall' would mean 'emergency Call'. But this interpretation would confuse a lot of people. Then, how does eCall differ from what we normally call 'Emergency Call (like 911)' ?\n\nI will explain on the details of this difference later, but simply put, the biggest difference would be the usual 'Emergency call' is a kind of voice call between a human and Emergency Call Center (usually another person in Emergency Call Center)' but 'eCall' is a call between a machine (called IVS : In Vehicle System within an automobile) and Emergency Center;.\n\nFor the persons who likes formal definition, I would quote some descriptions from a couple of international standards as follows :\n\neCall is a manually or automatically initiated emergency call, (TS12 : teleServiceCode 12) from a vehicle, supplemented with a minimum set of emergency related data (MSD), as defined under the EU Commission's eSafety initiative\n\neCall provides reliable full-duplex data communications between IVS and PSAP in addition to emergency voice call (E112) via the cellular network, and can be initiated either automatically or manually. The eCall In-band Modem uses the same voice channel as used for the emergency voice call. eCall allows reliable transmission of MSD alternating with a speech conversation through the existing voice communication paths in cellular mobile phone systems. The expected benefit is that emergency services will be made aware of accidents much more rapidly, will get precise information on location, vehicle type etc. and therefore will be able to reach accident victims faster, with the potential to save many lives annually.\n\nBefore we talk of the technical details of eCall, let's take a 10000-feet overview (high level view) on how eCall go through. You may find a lot of illustrations, cartoons on eCall from internet and following is my own version of illustration. I put the number labels on each of the steps and I would put a short descriptions on what's happening at each step.\n\n(2) eCall is triggered. eCall can be triggered in many ways. It can be triggered automatically by Air Bag or internal sensors. Or a person (e.g, driver) in the car can push the emergency button in the car to trigger the eCall.\n\n(3) The eCall device installed in the car (called IVS : In-Vehicle System) go through Emergency Voice Call setup process to establish the voice call channel. Once the voice call channel is established, the IVS send eCall Data (MSD : Minimal Set of Data) to PSAP (Public Safety Answering Point)\n\n(4) Once the eCall Data(MSD) is received by PSAP, the information would show up automatically on the screen at PSAP center.\n\n(5) The personnel at PSAP center may try voice contact to the person in the car if possible. But there would be many cases where this is not possible when person in the car is injured badly.\n\nFor those who came from Cellular protocol and new to eCall, it would be a little confusing on figuring out the difference between eCall and another type of Emergency Call (like 911 in North America) which we are familiar with in daily life. For those people, I think it would be easier / clearer to explain the difference in terms of overall protocol sequence. Following is my understanding (the image formed in my brain when I first got trained about this).\n\nAs you see here in the following illustration, there is common portions and different portions between eCall and Emergency Call.\n\nNOTE : IVS stands for In-Vehicle System. It is the eCall / Cellular module that are installed within Car (within Telematics module in most case). In terms of testing, this is a DUT\n\neCall Higher Layer Application Protocol (HLAP) is very simple (at least comparting to Cellular Protocol). Actually there is only one critical data to be transferred. The critical data is called MSD(Minimal Set of Data). All the remaining part is just to get MSD delivered to PSAP (Emergency Call Center) with reliability.\n\nAs in Cellular Voice Call, in HLAP there are two different type of call mode depending on who (IVS or PSAP) initiates call. The eCall initiated by IVS is called 'PUSH mode' and this is similar concept as MO(Mobile Originating) call in cellular voice call.\n\nThe eCall initiated by PSAP is called 'PULL mode' and this is similar concept as MT(Mobile Terminating) call in cellular voice call.\n\nThe two illustrations in this section is based on ETSI 103.428 Figure 2. The ETSI diagram is a single diagram showing both PUSH and PULL mode in single sequence. It looked a little confusing to me, so I split the digram into two separate diagram as shown below.\n\nNOTE 1 : IVS stands for In-Vehicle System. It is the eCall / Cellular module that are installed within Car (within Telematics module in most case). In terms of testing, this is a DUT\n\nNOTE 2 : PSAP stands for Public Safety Answering Point. This is a kind of Emergency Call Center.\n\nPSAP PUSH Mode Call is like MO call in celluar terminology. This is the call initiated by IVS (the mobile unit installed inside the car). I think in most case of eCall, the eCall goes in PUSH mode as illustrated below.\n\nPSAP PUSH Mode Call is like MT call in celluar terminology. This is the call initiated by PSAP (the call center). If you compare this with PUSH mode sequence, you would notice that most of the part are same. The only difference is the SEND-MSD (START) signal before the Initiation signal. This is also very much like cellular protocol. If you compare the MO Call and MT Call sequence in cellular protocol, you would notice that most part of the two are almost same. The main difference is that in MT Call the cellular network send 'Paging' (a kind of trigger for UE to initiate the call).\n\nAnother sequence that illustrate the eCall process with a little low layer point of view (especially in terms of LL/HL ACK operation) is shown below. This applies to both PUSH and PULL model.\n\n< ETSI TR 126.969 - Figure 1: Timeline of eCall with IVS initiated signalling and HL-ACK in normal operation >\n\nThere are various timers in eCall protocol which should be met in order to guarantee the normal functionality of the eCall. Some of these timers are an important criterial of testing eCall functionality.\n\nAs mentioned above, the only one fundamental goal for eCall is to deliver MSD(Minimal Set of Data) with reliability. Then you may ask what kind of information is in the MSD. High level description of the imformation in MSD can be find from following description. As you see, the most important information in the MSD is the location data and vehicle information.\n\nThe eCall modem allows to transfer a data message from the IVS over the cellular network to the PSAP which is denoted as eCall MSD. The MSD can include, e.g. vehicle location information, time stamp, number of passengers, Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), and other relevant accident information\n\nThe Minimum Set of Data forming the data component of an eCall sent from a vehicle to a Public Safety Answering Point or other designated emergency call centre. The MSD has a maximum size of 140 bytes and includes, for example, vehicle identity, location information and time-stamp.\n\nBefore we think of this, let's think of why we need to care of this. We should care of this because eCall signaling message and data are delivered in the form of Voice call data of GSM or WCDMA cellular network.\n\nIn GSM / WCDMA, various different types of codecs are used. Basically the codec selection is a job for the specific Radio Access Network equipment(RAN Equipment) that is communicating with the eCall device. The RAN Equipment (Network) would select the codec that would give the best performance in a specific situation. 'Performance' mean 'How fast the eCall data can be delivered' and 'How reliably it can be delivered under a specific channel condition'. It would be too much (or too boring) to present the full details on these performance here. If you are really interested in the details, refer to ETSI TR 126.969 and it would give you a lot of test data for various different Codecs.\n\nIn theory, you can use a live network and PSAP Simulator to test your eCall Device (IVS). But theory is just a theory. You would come across a lot of issues to overcome if you go for this option even though I cannot say it is impossible.\n\nAnother way of testing the eCall device is to construct test setup as described in ETSI 103.428 section 6 Test Configurations. In this document, it is described to use a private cellular network for various Interoperability and Conformance Testing.\n\nThe most practical solution (Test setup) that will be used in the industry would be to use Cellular Network Simulator and PSAP simulator as illustrated below.\n\nAssuming that you have a test setup and you need to determine what to test. As in most of other wireless and cellular device device, you may think of general test that tend to happen during the development or system integration stage. We often call these test in various different name such as function test, integration test or smoke test etc. Usually test specification / procedure tend not to be clearly defined or the procedure changes often depending on situations. Also those test procedure / test item may vary depending on manufacturer. Therefore, it would not be easy to clearly define on what to test for this stage. However, if you just take a close look at the overall eCall protocol, you would easily guess high level test items even without looking into any specification. My personal version of the guess work about the first level test are shown below. You may come up with different idea, but I don't think there would be any big difference between your idea and my idea.\n\nOnce you complete the general function test during development and system integration level and have a stable device, you would forward the device to conformance test. Once you are at the stage of conformance test, you don't have to worry about what to test because a lot of other people (standard body) put a lot of effort and energy and came out with well defined document. In 3GPP/ETSI, those test procedures are defined in ETSI TS 103.428.\n\nAfter completing the conformance, if you are trying to sell the device (acutually Automakers trying to sell cars) in a specific region (e.g, Europe, Asia, America etc), you may need to go through a specific set of test cases specified by the regulatory body in that specific region.\n\nFollowings are the examples of how eCall is being testing during the development or for conformance test before commercialization.\n\nFollowings are the list of the specifications for eCall. I think the most fundamental specifications are CEN documents. But it is not free to get those spec. Recently 3GPP / ETSI has released various specifications. I think most part of the 3GPP specification are based on CEN specification.\n\n: Describes mostly on physical/transport layer design and process of transmitter and reciever.\n\n: This documents describes on API and parameter descriptions of eCall modem protocol stack. It describes on overall software architecture and API prototype but not show the function body. Unless you are developing the protocol stack, you would not need to read this spec.\n\n: This documents describes general logics on eCall Test, but it does not specifies any specific test cases or details of protocol sequence. If you are interested in physical / transport layer level testing, this document would help you to catch the overall test concept.\n\n: If you are interested in high level protocol and function test, this document would help a lot. It shows overall protocol sequence of eCall and decfines specific test sequences. Most of the test in this document (as of V1.1.1 (2016-06)) are based on CEN EN 16062:2015\n\nRoad transport and traffic telematics eSafety eCall minimum set of data - Draft EN 081018\n\nIntelligent transport systems eSafety - Pan European eCall - Operating requirements",

Single Cell Point To Multiploint (SC-PTM) uses the eMBMS system architecture, providing enhancements in the air interface to improve radio efficiency and to reduce latency. SC-PTM supports broadcast/multicast services over single cell, and the broadcast/multicast area can be dynamically adjusted cell by cell according to user's distribution.\n\nSC-PTM transfers the broadcast/multicast services using LTE downlink shared channel (i.e. PDSCH), and it is scheduled using a common RNTI (i.e. Group-RNTI) for a group of users. The SC-PTM scheduling is quite agile and radio resources could be dynamically assigned in time and frequency domain by PDCCH based on real time traffic load TTI by TTI.\n\nSC-PTM is especially suitable for scenarios where broadcast/ multicast service is expected to be delivered to a limited number of cells due to user interests and the concerned cells may dynamically change due to user movement. SC-PTM allows efficient radio utilisation and flexible deployment of number of applications, e.g. critical communications, traffic information for cars and on-demand TV services, etc.\n\nLTE Broadcast Test Specifications demonstrate Device Conformity - 3GPP news article July 2015",

Unfortunately I haven't found any single book or web pages or YouTube that gives everything for me to understand the details. Probably those material may have a lot more informations than I understood and definitely it is my poor understanding and level of knowledge. However, even though I couldn't build up all of my comprehension from a single\nsource, I can definitely say that each and every materials that I went through helped me gradually build up my level of understanding and at least get me more familiar to this topic.\n\nIn the same logic, I don't think this page would give all the information that you need nor can make everything understandable to you. But I hope this can be at least one of the many resources that help you gradually build up your knowledge on this subject.\n\nChannel is a physical media through which the transmitted signal follow. For example, in a very simple communication system like RS232. What you call RS232 cable (made up of copper) is the channel. Let's think about ethernet communication (wired LAN). In this case, what you call LAN cable is the channel (one PC can be an transmitter and another PC can be a reciever.). How about mobile\ncommunication like a mobile phone ? My mobile phone and a basestation can be a transmitter and reciever and the air space and all other obstacles(e.g, mountain, building etc) in between a mobile phone and a base station can be a channel.\n\nIt is mathematical technique to describe the behavior (characteristics) of channel. I know you are not math geek -:) Me neither. But unfortunately you would never understand the details of channel model without using any math. But I don't think the math itself in this technology is such a tricky thing. Real challenge is to get yourself very familiar with those mathematical concept to the\npoint where you are understanding those mathemtatical symbols as your own language. I know it would not happen overnight.. you need to spend a lot of time and effort to reach such a familiarity level.\n\nBefore I start describing the details of modeling specific antenna configuration, let's briefly review on how we decribe a generic antenna configuration. You will see similar way of description in almost every textbook, web pages or papers. So I would strongly recommend you to get familiar with this generic representation. Expecially try to get familiar with relationship between the mathematical\nsymbols and physical entities shown in the illustration. Many textbook or paper just put down a lot of formula, equations without this kind of illustration. So the capability of converting those mathematical expressions into this kind of physical representation would be the first step you have to build up. However, don't just memorize the mathematical symbols here since many authors tend to use a little different symbols. Try to understand the real meaning of those mathematical symbols.\n\nLet's look into following illustration. It has many transmission antenna (labeled as Tx) and many reciever antenna (labeled as Rx). Number of Tx antenna is labelled as 't' and the number of Rx antenna is labelled as 'r'. For example, if t = 2 and r = 2, it becomes 2 x 2 MIMO configuration.\n\nAnd you see all the possible correlations between Tx antenna and Rx antenna and each of those correlations are labeled as 'h'. The subscript of 'h' is represented in the form of 'h_rx_tx'. For example, h21 means the channel coefficient between 'tx antenna 1' and 'rx antenna 2'.\n\n'n' represents a noise added to each of the reciever antenna. In really, there are many different sources of noise coming into each antenna, but in the mathematical model all the noise sources are combined to a single source with a certain statistical distribution. For example, n1 is the combination of all the noise sources coming into Rx antenna 1.\n\n'x' represents each symbol (one spot on constellation) being transmitted by each Tx antenna. For example, 'x1' represents the symbol being transmitted by Tx antenna 1.\n\n'y' represents signal (one spot on constellation) being recieved by each Rx antenna. For example, 'y1' represents the signal being recieved by Rx antenna 1.\n\nIf you just directly translate the illustration above into a mathematical expression you will get multiple equations as follows. This kind of conversion goes on almost automatically in the brain for the engineers who is working in this area or any kind fo system modeling, but don't get frustrated if you are new to this. Just take only one antenna (y1 for example) and try to mapping\neach term (e.g, h11 x1, h12 x2) to the illustration and you will understand how each of these equations came out.\n\nThen if you just convert this simultaneous equation (system equation) into a vector/matrix form, you would get following equation.\n\nThis simple equation (y = Hx + n) is the starting point of almost any channel modeling and channel estimation. Once you get this system equation, you need to go through a long, tedious, boring, confusing process to derive various other information as illustrated below.\n\nYou may have different answer to this question. At least to me, the answer is \"It is so boring and dry\". So to keep focusing in the subject without falling into sleep for more than 20 minutes was the most difficult part for me :). You might have similar problem when you were sitting in Linear Algebra course in the university. You will experience the same thing even while reading\ndown from next section. But once you get more and more familiar with this subject and all of those mathmatical formula start looking like your verbal language, then you would feel like reading a novel when you read through the material about this subject. To be honest, I am not there yet... I can just stay up a little bit longer than 20 mins without falling a sleep :)\n\nFrom the Generalized Mode, we can derive roughly three different typical cases as shown below. The details of each of the cases will be explained in separate pages linked below.",

What confuse you would about 'how one technology differs from other technologies ?' or 'which technology I have to chose for my application or use model ?'\n\nThe simple answer to the question \"Which technology do I have to pick for my application or my use model ?\" is \"It depends on the nature of your application\".\n\nI know.. you would not take this as an answer. You would ask for more specific answers.\n\nIf you want to get more specific answers, you would have specific answers to a lot of specific questions as listed below. (This list would get extended as learn/observe more from various discussions/forums).\n\nI would not put my comments on each of the questions for now.. just to give you some time for you to think.. (good excuse for my laziness :)).\n\nThis is basically asking about the data rate of the end node in your IoT system. Is it collecting a simple data like Temperature, Humidity which takes up only several bytes at a time of transmission. Normally this kind of IoT device should be very low cost. It is less likely to let this kind of device to use relatively expensive network (like cellular network).\n\nThis is asking 'Are you going to use a simple sensors (like temperature, humidity) ?' or some other devices which requires a relatively large packet transmission/reception or which requires very high level data security.\n\nThis would be highly related to Q1. Usually the type of data to be collected and transmitted would determine the necessary data rate, but there might be some exceptions. For example, if you need very sophisticated data security and add a lot of additional portions to the original data to implement the security, the data rate that you would need would get much higher. Another exception can be the case where you want to upgrade/reconfigure your end-node remotely. Of course, this would not happen very often but if you really want to do this, the data rate should be pretty high for the end-node to download necessary firmware and configuration information.\n\nQ4. Does your end node device will both transmit and receive data ? or only transmit the data (no recieve) ?\n\nMost of the IoT application is Uplink centeric (transmission only in terms of end-device) and in some extreme case there are some application that is uplink only. It is understandable for most of IoT application to be Uplink dominant but there would be a lot of restriction if it goes with uplink only. For example, you have a very simple end-device (e.g, a temperature sensor) and transmitted it to a Gateway or Basestation. If the device is uplink only (transmission only), the device can only transmit the data and there is no way to verify whther it successfully reached the destination or not. To verify the successful transmission of the data, there should be some mechanism by which the destination (e.g, Gateway) can send Acknowledge message to the device that has sent the data. To do this, the system should allow downlink (i.e, reception in terms of end-device). Also, if you want to apply any form of data security or remote re-configuration or remote update, you need both uplink and downlink.\n\nLet me ask another question before this .. Are you going to use unlicensed band/frequency (i.e ISM band) or a licensed band / frequency (e.g, Cellular) ? If you decided to use ISM band, it is highly likely to use sub Ghz band (i.e, around 900 Mhz) or around 2.4 Ghz frequency. If you decided to use licensed band, it will be determined by which frequency will be allowed in the area where your IoT system will be installed.\n\nIf you selected unlicensed band, you are free to use any of the frequency .. but it is not only you who is free to use the frequency.. there might be a lot of other devices that uses the same frequency which might cause unwanted interference. If you decided to use the licensed frequency, there will be licensing / permission issue.\n\nIf the transmitter and reciever is communicating within the range of couple of meters or tens of meters, you can use many of the existing short range communication like Bluetooth, ZigBee etc. However, if it should extend to several km or tens of km, you have to use those technologies that can cover wide range like LPWAN (e.g, LoRa, SigFox etc) or Cellular technology.\n\nBasically IoT requires a cirtain type of Network structure whether it is small or large (in most case it is not peer to peer communication). Then you would have question on how to form such a network and how much control you want to have over the whole network. Some people would say 'I want to implement only the end Node(e.g, terminal sensor module) and get it connected to an exisiting network that are already established'. In this case, you would consider Cellular based IoT or SigFox. In this option, you would have less work to do but very limitted or no controllability for network. Some people would say 'I want to implement everything from the end node to the network and I want to have full control over the network'. In this case, you may like LoRa type of technology. You would have full controllability, but downside is that there are a lot of works for you to do.\n\nFor example, SKT deployed a Nation wide IoT service in South Korea around the end of 2016 based on LoRa technology. According to Ref [5], they were considering LoRa, SigFox, NB-LTE(and other LTE based IoT). LTE IoT was excluded for other reason, but between LoRa and SigFox, the controllability to Network was one of the factor to select LoRa.\n\nQ10. Do you need any security for the data being transmitted and received ? At which level, if you need ?\n\nI personally think this is pretty important issue since there are many cases where it is not easy to change / upgrade the software of a IoT end node once it is installed or take too much cost to visit every installation points and change software of the device. However, I don't see this issues widely discussed in the industry yet (as of early 2017). Probably they are afraid to bring up the issues that does not have any simple / easy solution. In theory, the smartest solution is to let the end node device itself to download the new software and upgrade it by itself. We have seen this type of software upgrade in cellular phone (smart phone) pretty commonly these days. We may think of utilizing the similar technologies to IoT devices. However, the biggest problem would be the bandwidth. Most of IoT device is designed for low data rate communication, but this kind of wireless software upgrade would take pretty big bandwidth. So if you think of this kind of wireless software upgrade, you would need to choose such a technology to provide big enough bandwidth for wireless woftware upgrade.\n\nQ12. What kind of protocol (phy, mac, application layer protocol) do you want to use ?\n\nThere are many different technologies that claim to be the best for IoT. Some of them would already be available at your time of deployment, but some technologies would be being talked a lot but not available or not mature yet. So if your deployment schedule is very near, you would need to choose a technology that are mature right now.\n\nFor example, SKT deployed a Nation wide IoT service in South Korea around the end of 2016 based on LoRa technology. According to Ref [5], they were considering LoRa, SigFox, NB-LTE(and other LTE based IoT). SigFox were excluded for other reason, but between LoRa and SigFox, LoRa was selected mainly due to availability. LoRa technology was already there when they were planning, but there were still a couple of years to go for LTE based IoT to be mature enough.\n\n[3] NarrowBand IoT Demystified: What are the benefits and why do we need it?

The base requirement was to provide at least the same security features as LTE.\n\nNon-Standalone NR Security\n\nThe NSA architecture uses LTE as the master radio access technology, while the new radio access technology (i.e. NR) serves as secondary radio access technology with User Equipment's (UEs) connected to both radios. Except for capability negotiation, security procedures for EN-DC basically follow the specifications for dual connectivity security for LTE. The WI summary for EDCE5 security (cf. corresponding clause above) provides details.\n\nEvolution of the trust model\n\nMoving on from the Non-Standalone deployment, in a Standalone 5G system, the trust model has evolved. Trust within the network is considered as decreasing the further one moves from the core. This has impact on decisions taken in 5G security design, thus we present the trust model in this section.\n\nThe trust model in the UE is reasonably simple: there are two trust domains, the tamper proof UICC on which the Universal Subscriber Identity Module (USIM) resides as trust anchor and the Mobile Equipment (ME). The ME and the USIM together form the UE.\n\nThe network side trust model for roaming and non-roaming cases are shown in the two following figures respectively, which shows the trust in multiple layers, like in an onion.\n\nThe Radio Access Network (RAN) is separated into distributed units (DU, or gNB-DU) and central units (CU, or gNB-CU) - DU and CU together form the gNB, as seen above. The DU does not have any access to customer communications as it may be deployed in unsupervised sites. The CU and Non-3GPP Inter Working Function (N3IWF - not shown in the figures), which terminates the Access Stratum (AS) security, will be deployed in sites with more restricted access.\n\nIn the Core Network, the Access Management Function (AMF) serves as termination point for Non-Access Stratum (NAS) security. Currently, i.e. in the 3GPP 5G Phase 1 specification, the AMF is collocated with the SEcurity Anchor Function (SEAF) that holds the root key (known as anchor key) for the visited network. The security architecture is defined in a future proof fashion, as it allows separation of the security anchor from the mobility function that could be possible in a future evolution of the system architecture.\n\nThe AUthentication Function (AUSF) keeps a key for reuse, derived after authentication, in case of simultaneous registration of a UE in different access network technologies, i.e. 3GPP access networks and non-3GPP access networks such as IEEE 802.11 Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN). Authentication credential Repository and Processing Function (ARPF) keeps the authentication credentials. This is mirrored by the USIM on the side of the client, i.e. the UE side. The subscriber information is stored in the Unified Data Repository (UDR). The Unified Data Management (UDM) uses the subscription data stored in UDR and implements the application logic to perform various functionalities such as authentication credential generation, user identification, service and session continuity etc. Over the air interface, both active and passive attacks are considered on both control plane and user plane. Privacy has become increasingly important leading to permanent identifiers being kept secret over the air interface.\n\nIn the roaming architecture, the home and the visited network are connected through SEcurity Protection Proxy (SEPP) for the control plane of the internetwork interconnect. This enhancement is done in 5G because of the number of attacks coming to light recently such as key theft and re-routing attacks in SS7 and network node impersonation and source address spoofing in signalling messages in DIAMETER that exploited the trusted nature of the internetwork interconnect.\n\n5G Phase 1 Security (Release 15)\n\n5G Phase 1 brings several enhancements to LTE security, some of the key points are presented in this section. Details of 5G Phase 1 security can be found in TS 33.501 [1].\n\nPrimary authentication: Network and device mutual authentication in 5G is based on primary authentication. This is similar to LTE but there are a few differences. The authentication mechanism has in-built home control allowing the home operator to know whether the device is authenticated in a given network and to take final call of authentication. In 5G Phase 1 there are two mandatory authentication options: 5G Authentication and Key Agreement (5G-AKA) and Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)-AKA', i.e. EAP-AKA'. Optionally, other EAP based authentication mechanisms are also allowed in 5G - for specific cases such as private networks. Also, primary authentication is radio access technology independent, thus it can run over non-3GPP technology such as IEEE 802.11 WLANs.\n\nSecondary authentication: Secondary authentication in 5G is meant for authentication with data networks outside the mobile operator domain. For this purpose, different EAP based authentication methods and associated credentials can be used. A similar service was possible in LTE as well, but now it is integrated in the 5G architecture.\n\nInter-operator security: Several security issues exist in the inter-operator interface arising from SS7 or Diameter [5,6] in the earlier generations of mobile communication systems. To counter these issues, 5G Phase 1 provides inter-operator security from the very beginning.\n\nPrivacy: Subscriber identity related issues have been known since LTE and earlier generations of mobile systems. In 5G a privacy solution is developed that protects the user's subscription permanent identifier against active attacks. A home network public key is used to provide subscriber identity privacy.\n\nService based architecture (SBA): The 5G core network is based on a service based architecture, which did not exist in LTE and earlier generations. Thus 5G also provides adequate security for SBA.\n\nCentral Unit (CU) - Distributed Unit (DU): In 5G the base-station is logically split in CU and DU with an interface (the F1) between them. Security is provided for the CU-DU interface. This split was also possible in LTE, but in 5G it is part of the architecture that can support a number of deployment options (e.g. co-located CU-DU deployment is also possible). The DUs, which are deployed at the very edge of the network, don't have access to any user data when confidentiality protection is enabled. Even with the CU-DU split, the air interface security point in 5G remains the same as in LTE, namely in the radio access network.\n\nKey hierarchy: The 5G hierarchy reflects the changes in the overall architecture and the trust model using the security principle of key separation. One main difference in 5G compared to LTE is the possibility for integrity protection of the user plane.\n\nMobility: Although mobility in 5G is similar to LTE, the difference in 5G is the assumption that the mobility anchor in the core network can be separated from the security anchor.\n\nReferences",

Operators have met this challenge by increasing capacity with new radio spectrum, adding multi-antenna techniques and implementing more efficient modulation and coding schemes.\n\nHowever, these measures alone are insufficient in the most crowded environments and at cell edges where performance can significantly degrade. Operators are also adding small cells and tightly-integrating these with their macro networks to spread traffic loads, widely maintain performance and service quality while reusing spectrum most efficiently.\n\nOne way to expand an existing macro-network, while maintaining it as a homogeneous network, is to \"densify\" it by adding more sectors per eNB or deploying more macro-eNBs. However, reducing the site-to-site distance in the macro-network can only be pursued to a certain extent because finding new macro-sites becomes increasingly difficult and can be expensive, especially in city centres. An alternative is to introduce small cells through the addition of low-power base stations (eNBs, HeNBs or Relay Nodes (RNs)) or Remote Radio Heads (RRH) to existing macro-eNBs. Site acquisition is easier and cheaper with this equipment which is also correspondingly smaller.\n\nSmall cells are primarily added to increase capacity in hot spots with high user demand and to fill in areas not covered by the macro network - both outdoors and indoors. They also improve network performance and service quality by offloading from the large macro-cells. The result is a heterogeneous network with large macro-cells in combination with small cells providing increased bitrates per unit area. See Figure 1.\n\nHeterogeneous network planning was already used in GSM. The large and small cells in GSM are separated through the use of different frequencies. This solution is still possible in LTE. However, LTE networks mainly use a frequency reuse of one to maximize utilization of the licensed bandwidth.\n\nIn heterogeneous networks the cells of different sizes are referred to as macro-, micro-, pico- and femto-cells; listed in order of decreasing base station power. The actual cell size depends not only on the eNB power but also on antenna position, as well as the location environment; e.g. rural or city, indoor or outdoor . The HeNB (Home eNB) was introduced in LTE Release 9 (R9). It is a low power eNB which is mainly used to provide indoor coverage, femto-cells, for Closed Subscriber Groups (CSG), for example, in office premises. See Figure 2.\n\nSpecific to HeNBs, is that they are privately owned and deployed without coordination with the macro-network. If the frequency used in the femto-cell is the same as the frequency used in the macro-cells, and the femto-cell is only used for CSG, then there is a risk of interference between the femto-cell and the surrounding network.\n\nThe Relay Node (RN) is another type of low-power base station added to the LTE R10 specifications. The RN is connected to a Donor eNB (DeNB) via the Un radio interface, which is based on the LTE Uu interface. See Figure 2. When the frequencies used on Uu and Un for the RN are the same, there is a risk of self interference in the RN. From the UE perspective the RN will act as an eNB, and from the DeNB's view the RN will be seen as a UE. As also mentioned, RRHs connected to an eNB via fibre can be used to provide small cell coverage.\n\nIntroducing a mix of cell sizes and generating a heterogeneous network adds to the complexity of network planning. In a network with a frequency reuse of one, the UE normally camps on the cell with the strongest received DL signal (SSDL), hence the border between two cells is located at the point where SSDL is the same in both cells. In homogeneous networks, this also typically coincides with the point of equal path loss for the UL (PLUL) in both cells. In a heterogeneous network, with high-power nodes in the large cells and low-power nodes in the small cells, the point of equal SSDL will not necessarily be the same as that of equal PLUL. See Figure 3.\n\nA major issue in heterogeneous network planning is to ensure that the small cells actually serve enough users. One way to do that is to increase the area served by the small cell, which can be done through the use of a positive cell selection offset to the SSDL of the small cell. This is called Cell Range Extension (CRE). See Figure 4.\n\nA negative effect of this is the increased interference on the DL experienced by the UE located in the CRE region and served by the base station in the small cell. This may impact the reception of the DL control channels in particular.\n\nA number of features added to the 3GPP LTE specification can be used to mitigate the above-mentioned interference problem in heterogeneous networks with small cells:\n\nICIC was introduced in R8. The eNBs can communicate using ICIC via the X2 interface to mitigate inter-cell interference for UEs at the cell edge. The X2AP message used for this is called \"Load Information\". See Figure 5. Through the \"Load Information\" message an eNB can inform neighbouring eNBs about: UL interference level per Physical Resource Block (PRB); UL PRBs that are allocated to cell edge UEs, and hence are sensitive to UL interference; and if DL Tx power is higher or lower than a set threshold value. The eNBs receiving these messages can use the received information to optimize scheduling for UEs at cell edges.\n\nICIC has evolved to better support heterogeneous network deployments -- especially interference control for DL control channels. Enhanced ICIC (eICIC) was introduced in LTE R10. The major change is the addition of time domain ICIC, realized through use of Almost Blank Subframes (ABS). ABS includes only control channels and cell-specific reference signals, no user data, and is transmitted with reduced power. When eICIC is used, the macro-eNB will transmit ABS according to a semi-static pattern. During these subframes, UEs at the edge, typically in the CRE region of small cells, can receive DL information, both control and user data. The macro-eNB will inform the eNB in the small cell about the ABS pattern. See Figure 6.\n\nICIC is evolved in LTE R11 to further enhanced ICIC (feICIC). The focus here is interference handling by the UE through inter-cell interference cancellation for control signals, enabling even further cell range extension.\n\neICIC and feICIC are especially important when Carrier Aggregation (CA) is not used.\n\nCarrier Aggregation (CA) is introduced in R10, with backward compatibility to R8, to increase the total bandwidth available to UEs and hence their maximum bitrates. When CA is used a number of R8 carriers, referred to as Component Carriers (CC), are aggregated and any CA-capable UE can be allocated resources on all CCs, while R8/R9 UEs can only be allocated resources on one CC. Cross-carrier scheduling is an important feature in heterogeneous networks. Using cross-carrier scheduling it is possible to map the Physical DL control channels (PDCCH) on different CCs in the large and small cells. See Figure 7. The PDCCH, carrying DL Control Information (DCI) with scheduling information, must be received by the UEs at the cell edge; PDCCH may be transmitted with higher power than the traffic channels. Hence, using different carriers for the PDCCH in the large and small cells reduces the risk of PDCCH interference.\n\nFrom LTE R11 onwards it is possible to handle CA with CCs requiring different timing advance (TA); for example, combining CCs from eNBs with CCs from RRHs. See Figure 8.\n\nOne way to ensure that a UE is using both the best DL and the best UL carrier in a heterogeneous network is to use CoMP, introduced in LTE R11. With CoMP a number of transmission/reception points (i.e. eNBs, RNs or RRHs) can be coordinated to provide service to a UE - for example, data can be transmitted at the same time in the same PRBs from more than one transmission point to one UE, or data can be received from one transmission point in one subframe and from another transmission point in the next subframe. CoMP can be used both in DL and UL. When CoMP is used in a heterogeneous network a number of macro-cells and small cells can be involved in data transmission to and from one UE. Especially useful in heterogeneous networks is the possibility for a UE in the cell range extension region to utilize the best UL in the small cell and the best DL in the macro-cell. See Figure 9. This, however, requires that the macro-eNB and the base station in the small cell are synchronized, and most likely it will require a combination of macro-eNB with RRHs in the small cell.\n\nFurther enhancements regarding heterogeneous network and small cells are coming in future 3GPP Releases. At the time of writing, Release 12 is still in the process of being formulated with some features in the study phase and others, such as work on interference management for neighbour TDD cells, dual connectivity between the macro cell and small cells, mobility planning within hyper-dense environments and advances in carrier aggregation combinations already in the normative phase (specifications).\n\nFuture updates to this paper will include what has been achieved with the completion of Release 12 during the second half of 2014.\n\n\"...Coordinating the low-power layer of small cells with the macro network improves performance across the entire network while also further boosting efficiencies in spectrum use and power consumption, automating network configuration and optimization. The upcoming 3GPP Release 12 (due to be frozen September 2014) standardises various capabilities in these developments including dual connectivity, small cell on/off and 256 QAM...\" ...Read the full article",

That is guaranteed by routing all signalling information though the anchor MSC server even if the traffic channel of a call is routed through another MSC server due to handover.\n\nThe Gateway MSC server acts as a gateway into other PLMN or fixed networks. Within the PLMN, the GMSC server is responsible for the generation of CDRs for calls routed from or into other networks.\n\nIf subscribed CAMEL services apply to MS, the (G)MSC servers contain CAMEL subscription data providing the information required for invocation of the CAMEL dialogues for controlling the MS terminating and MS originating calls. CDR parameters resulting from the CAMEL treatment applying to MS calls is derived from the CAMEL subscription data.\n\nIn addition to user subscribed services, specific dialled CAMEL services might be invoked which also influence existing records or even trigger the generation of separate records steered by service logic.\n\nIn addition to the information collected from these network elements, network management functions are required for the administration of on-line charging data stored in the network nodes. This data is employed to drive the charge display on the User Equipment (UE) as required by the Advice of Charge (AoC) service in TS 21.115 [101] and charging perspective of AoC is defined by TS 32.280 [40].",

The VLR shall check this subscription parameter against the radio access technology that supports the LA/RA in which the UE is roaming to decide whether the location update should be allowed or rejected.\nFor further information of the Subscriber access restriction see 3GPP TS 23.008.\n\n3.6.1.3\tLocation cancellation procedure\nThe procedure is used by the home location register to remove a MS from a visitor location register. The procedure will normally be used when the MS has moved to an area controlled by a different location register. The procedure can also be used in other cases, e.g. an MS ceases to be a subscriber of the Home PLMN.\n3.6.1.4\tMobile subscriber purging procedure\nA VLR may purge the subscriber data for an MS which has not established radio contact for a period determined by the network operator. Purging means to delete the subscriber data and to \"freeze\" the TMSI that has been allocated to the purged MS in order to avoid double TMSI allocation. The VLR shall inform the HLR of the purging.\nWhen the HLR is informed of the purging, it shall set the flag \"MS purged\" in the IMSI record of the MS concerned. Presence of the \"MS purged\" flag will cause any request for routing information for a call or short message to the MS to be treated as if the MS were not reachable.\n\nIn the VLR, the \"frozen\" TMSI is freed for usage in the TMSI allocation procedure by location updating for the purged MS in the same VLR, location cancellation for the purged MS or, in exceptional cases, by O&M.\nIn the HLR, the \"MS purged\" flag is reset by the location updating procedure and after reload of data from the non-volatile back-up that is performed when the HLR restarts after a failure.\n3.6.1.5\tSupport for subscription without MSISDN\nAn MSC/VLR may support delivery of SMS destined to an MS without MSISDN for GPRS and EPS operation whereby a MSISDN is not allocated as part of the subscription data (see 3GPP TS 23.060 subclause 5.3.17 and 3GPP TS 23.401).\nAn MSC/VLR which supports MSISDN-less operation shall indicate such support to the HLR in the MAP Update Location request.\nThe HLR should reject a MAP Update Location request received for an MSISDN-less subscription from a VLR not indicating support of MSISDN-less operation, with a cause indicating that roaming is not allowed.",

Now in early 2017 we are at the stage of testing LAA.\n\nTwo of the technology falling into this category is LTE-U and LTE-R. LTE-U has been proposed and start being implemented in the industry for about a year and LTE-R just start being proposed as Integrated wireless railway network to be commercialized .\n\nAs of Jun 2016, I don't see/hear anything about LTE-R.. but I saw the drastic evolution of unlicensed LTE that created several different technologies (names) to the list. It started with LTE-U and evolved to LAA, eLAA and recently we are hearing of new branches like MulteFire and LWA. I don't know how many other technologies are waiting to be newly evolved and which of these technologies\nwill survive to the end.. some of them are now pretty well defined but there are a lot of other features to be defined technically. I will keep following them up and try to write down whatever has been clarified.\n\nFollowings are the brief descriptions for each of these technologies. I will put further details under separate section if more technical details are published. Also, I put many whitepapers and YouTube links under Reference section. I would recommend you to go through those materials when you have free time and use this page as reminder afterwards. (The contents of this table\nis mostly based on Ref [7] )\n\nFollowings are the list of topics that gives you further details of various LTE-Unlicensed technologies.\n\nIn every wireless communication, the communicating parties (transmitter and reciever) need to allocatie a certain amount of resources in both time domain and frequency domain. However, we don't have much control over frequency domain resource allocation because those resources are fixed permanently or semi-statically. So it is usually not in the scope of scheduling. When it comes to scheduling, Time Domain resource allocation tend to be more important.\n\nIn 3GPP based technology (i.e, Cellular Communication Technology like LTE), the time domain scheduling is obvious and determinstic even when there are many devices are in communication because all of the time domain resources determined by the central master (Base Station /Node B/eNode B). However, in 802.11 based technology(i.e LAN, Wireless LAN etc) there is no central controling master in terms of scheduling. In this case, there is always possibility that transmission signal from one device interfere with communication of other devices. To prevent (or at least reduce) this situation, we need a special algorithm for Time Domain Scheduling. Time Domain Scheduling in this case mean 'Determine when to transmit and how long it transmit'.\n\nThen why we need to care of this kind of thing in LTE-Unlicensed technology ? Basically LTE Unlicensed technology (e.g, LTE-U, LAA etc) refer to a technology in which LTE operates in 802.11 frequency region. So LTE need to keep the rule set by 802.11 in order not to prevent the communiction between existing 802.11 devices.\n\nThere are many variations of the time domain scheduling, but the basic idea and logic is same. Basic idea is 'Your transmission should not interfere with communication between others' and the basic logic is 'Before you transmit anything, check if the chennel(medium) is already being used by others'. This logic can be illustrated as follows.\n\nThen you may have some questions as follows : How to check (i.e, how to figure out) whether the channel (medium) is being used by other ? and how long the device need to check before it make any decision ?\n\nIn the effort to answer these questions, you will come across many terms that may confuse you for so long. I tried to list up those confusing words and how these are related to each other in following illustration. If you are new to this area, I would suggest you to understand 'what is CS and ED ?' first and then try to understand how CS / ED is used in higher level technology like CSMA/CD, CSMA/CA, CCS, LBT, CSAT etc. Already feel headache ? :)\n\nCS / ED : CS stands for Carrier Sensing and ED stands for Energy Detection. The fundamental concept is same. The term CS is more frequently used in 802.11 area especially for Wired LAN Area. In this technology, the device measures the energy level in the channel (medium) mostly in the form of voltage and compares the measured voltage with a specified value (threshold value). ED stands for Energy Detection. it is more frequently used in wireless/cellular technology. In this method, the device measures the energy level in the channel (medium) mostly in the form of Power and compares the measured power with a specified value (threshold value)\n\nCSMA/CD or CSMA/CA : As the term CSMA(Carrier Sensing Multiple Access) implies, these are technology of figuring out whether a channel is available or not based on CS method. You don't need to know the details of thechnology under the context of LTE-Unlicensed technology, but if you are really interested in thses method refer to CSMA/CD and CSMA/CA page.\n\nCCA : CCA stands for Clear Channel Assessment. As the word implies, this is a method to figure out the channel is clear (i.e, nobody is using the channel). CCA perform ED(Energy Detection) for a certain period of time and make a decision whether the channel is clear or not. It is a common method being used in 802.11 (WLAN) technology.\n\nHow long CCA perform ED before it make decision ? It depends on higher layer technology (e.g, 802.11 FHSS, 802.11 OFDM, LBT). However, the minimum time span is 18 us sec.\n\nWhat is the threshold energy level to make decision whether the channel is being used by some other device or not ? This also varies depending on power class of the device and reciever antenna gain. However, the base threshold is -70 dBm.\n\nNOTE : Refer to 802.11 specification and ETSI EN 300 328 if you want to get full details and requirement for CCA.\n\nLBT: LBT stands for Listen Before Talk. According to ETSI EN 300 328, LBT is defined as 'mechanism by which an equipment applies clear channel assessment (CCA) before using the channel' (In this document, you can find a couple of variations of LBT depending on different situations). As you see in the terminology itself, 'Listen Before Talk' indicate two major process, the first one is 'Listen' and the second part is 'Talk'. The meaning of 'Talk' is obvious. It means 'Transmit Data'. The tricky part is 'what does it exactly mean by 'Listen''. In more technical definition, 'Listen' mean 'perform CCA(Clear Channel Assessment)'. You can find a more detailed description on LBT in IEEE P802.19-08/0034r0 (The specific value (i.e, transmission time, threshold value may vary depending on application, but I think this explains overal LBT mechanism in easier way than other documents).\n\nCSAT : CSAT stands for Carrier Sensing Adaptive Transmission. CSAT is very similar to CSMA or LBT(Listen Before Talk), the main difference is that CSAT monitors(senses) the medium for much longer duration (around tens of msec to 200 msec) comparing to normal WiFi CSMA, so that it would not interfere not only with WiFi\ndata transmission (QoS traffic) but also with more sporadic transmission like discovery signals (Ref [2]). Unlike other techiques described in this section (defined with focus on 802.11 technology), CSAT is defined by LTE-U Forum with focus on 3GPP technology.\n\nIn LTE, every transmission within a specified spectrum is well managed/scheduled both for downlink and uplink. So Network can figure out exactly when to transmit something and when UE will transmit something.. but in Unlicensed band transmission and reception by the existing WiFi device is not as predictable as in LTE. Basically anybody can transmit in anytime as long as it complies with\nCSMA/CA procedure.\n\nIn this kind of situation, how LTE network can schedule transmission in Unlicensed band ?\n\nOne method is for LTE cell to perform a special channel selection procedure and allocate the channel only when it is clean. \nIn channel selection process, network measures the energy level within the allowed band and use those area in which the energy level is under a certain threshold (e.g, -62 dBm over 20 Mhz BW).\n\nThe Cell performs this kind of channel selection algorithm in on-going mode and if needed it will select more suitable channel and switch to it.\n\nWhat if you (a Cell) fail to find any clean channel at the initial channel selection process ?\n\nIn this case, the cell use another mechanism called CSAT (Carrier-Sensing Adaptive Transmission). Technically, CSAT is very similar to CSMA or LBT(Listen Before Talk), the main difference is that CSAT monitors(senses) the medium for much longer duration (around tens of msec to 200 msec) comparing to normal WiFi CSMA, so that it would not interfere not only with WiFi\ndata transmission (QoS traffic) but also with more sporadic transmission like discovery signals (Ref [2]).\n\nAccording to Reference [5], there seems to be roughly three levels of Coexistence strategy regarding LTE-U. Most of these techniques are already mentioned in previous section, but let me rewrite in a little bit different words.\n\nChannel Selection : This says \"Use WiFi band only when it is not being used (i.e, the band is clean)\". To figure out whether it is being used or not, you have to measure the engergy level of the target band as described above.\n\nTime-domain coexistence techniques : Even when it fail to find any clean channel in channel selection stage, there is still some chance. Even though there is no clean channel at the point of channel selection, there might be some empty slots if you look at the time domain scheduling with relatively high granularity.\nTo find out this kind of time domain opportunity and in order not to make an interference at any time, they are considering several different technology like CSAT, eCSAT, LBT. My personal question were 'do we have to support all these technology everywhere (every devices)?'. This question was answered by Reference [5] as follows.\n\nFor non listen-before-talk (LBT) markets such as the US, South Korea, China and India, CSAT (Carrier Sensing Adaptive Transmission) can be used without changing Rel-10 Carrier Aggregation protocols for co-channel coexistence. For LBT markets such as Europe and Japan, Rel-13 LAA will enable channel sharing with Wi-Fi by performing clear channel assessment (CCA) based channel availability sensing and adapting the transmission duration on a fine timescale, ranging from 1ms-10ms\n\nOpportunistic SCell operation : To me, this sounds like a rule (not a technology). Basically this says \"Use the unlicensed band only when it is really necessary (e.g, in real demand on high throughput or when the primary cell is overloaded). Release the unlicensenced and fall back to anchor carrier when\nthe demand for unlicenced band is not critical.\n\nInterplay of these coexistance technical components are well illustrated as follows in Ref [2].\n\nLTE-U stands for LTE-Unlicensed. This is the first real implementation of the whole LTE-Unlicensed family as far as I remember. Since this is already implemented and tested relatively widely and a lot of details are known, I thought I got enough information to write this subject in a separate page. Refer to LTE-U page for the details.\n\nIn other LTE-Unlincensed technology, LTE borrow only radio spectrum from WLAN and all the transmission/reception technology except radio spectrum purely based on LTE. However, in LWA LTE borrows not only WLAN radio spectrum but also WLAN Access Point for transmitting data. This key difference is illustrated as below. To implement this key difference, we would need to implement many other\ntechnical components. The most important part would be to implmenet special interface between LTE eNB and WLAN AP. Then you may ask.. at which layer the eNB and WLAN will be connected ? It would be quicker to interact if they can get connected at lower layer (e.g, PHY/MAC), but LTE PHY/MAC and WLAN PHY/MAC is completely different.. so hard to make any connection at this layer. So they will use higher layer (specifically PDCP) for this connection. As you know, there is no PDCP layer in WLAN. So connecting at PDCP\nlayer might be a little bit misleading. More accruately speaking, LTE PDCP packet will be encapsulated into WLAN MAC frame.\n\nNow LWA is defined in 3GPP specification and I created a separate page for 3GPP LWA because it will be a long story. Refer to LWA page for the 3GPP details.\n\nAround the end of 2016, I start hearing of implementing this both on UE modem and Network, UE testing equipment side. Now (as of early 2017) I am hearing of testing this feature on real UE. So I decided to create separate page for this. Read LAA page for the details.\n\nPutting very simple way, Multipath Aggregation (more formally Multipath TCP Aggregation : mptcp) is LTE-WLAN aggregation at TCP level as illustrated below. The key component in this architecture would be MP Proxy (Multipath Proxy) and this part is being defined in IETF (Ref [12] )\n\nAs of now (Jan 2015), I don't have any specific information other than Integrated wireless railway network to be commercialized .\n\n[1] LTE-U/LAA, MuLTEfire and Wi-Fi; making best use of unlicensed spectrum (Qualcomm)\n\n[9] Cracking Google Project Fi & LTE/Wi-Fi Aggregation with Qualcomm - Wi-Fi Now Episode 5 (YouTube)\n\n[10] The LTE-U vs. Wi-Fi debate continues empowering carriers with seamless Wi-Fi - Wi-Fi Now Episode 15 (YouYube)\n\n[15] ETSI EN 300 328 Wideband transmission systems;Data transmission equipment operating in the 2,4 GHz ISM band and using wide band modulation techniques;",

The location information for each MS is stored in functional units called location registers. Functionally, there are two types of location registers:\nSee also 3GPP TS 23.002 where the network architecture is described, and 3GPP TS 23.008 where the data stored in the location registers are described.\nThe action taken by a MS in order to provide location information to the PLMN will be referred to as location updating.\n2.2\tLocation area and MSC area\nThe MSC area is composed of the area covered by all base stations controlled by the MSC. An MSC area may consist of several location areas. A location area is an area in which, after having performed a location update once, MSs may roam without being required to perform subsequent location updates for reason of location change. A location area consists of one or more cells.\n\nFor further details of the network architecture, see 3GPP TS 23.002.\n2.3\tLocation area identification\nThe Location Area Identification (LAI) plan is part of the base station identification plan. The base stations are identified uniquely (see 3GPP TS 23.003).\n2.4\tIMSI detach/attach operation\nThe support of IMSI detach/attach operation is mandatory in MSs. The facility is optional in the fixed infrastructure of the PLMN.\n2.4.1\tExplicit IMSI detach/attach\nExplicit IMSI detach operation is the action taken by an MS to indicate to the PLMN that the station has entered an inactive state (e.g. the station is powered down). Explicit IMSI attach operation is the action taken by an MS to indicate that the station has re-entered an active state (e.g. the station is powered up).\n2.4.2\tImplicit IMSI detach\n\nImplicit IMSI detach operation is the action taken by the VLR to mark an MS as detached when there has been no successful contact between the MS and the network for a time determined by the implicit detach timer. The value of the implicit detach timer is derived from the periodic location updating timer; when the MSC/VLR applies Mobility Management Congestion Control to a MS, the MSC/VLR may need to adjust the Implicit Detach timer as specified in clause 3.7.2. During an established radio contact, the implicit detach timer shall be prevented from triggering implicit detach. At the release of the radio connection, the implicit detach timer shall be reset and restarted. Implicit IMSI detach shall also be performed in the case of a negative response to an IMEI check.\n2.5\tUse of the term mobile station (MS) in the present document\n\nIn order to simplify the text the term Mobile Station (MS) as used in relation to location management refers to the entity where the IMSI is stored, i.e., in card operated MSs the term Mobile Station (MS) refers to the card.\n2.6\tPaging area\nAs an option, and for paging optimization purpose, the VLR may control Paging Areas. A Paging Area (PgA) is composed of up to 5 Location Areas, and the MSC area is composed of several Paging Areas. Paging areas may overlap each other. The Paging Area is stored in the HLR and updated at each paging area change. The Paging Area is sent by the HLR to the VLR at roaming number request and may be used by the MSC/VLR for paging (e.g. when LAI is not known, after MSC/VLR restart) (see 3GPP TS 23.018 [5a]).",

In release 13, you would see many statements about BL UE/CE UE, but I took me quite a while to find out what they stands for :) (I found it in 36.300).\n\nIn many Whitepaper or articles, you might have seen the term like MTC, LTE-M1. But in formal 3GPP Technical Specification, you would noticed that these terminology (e.g, MTC, LTE-M1) is not clearly defined. In 3GPP TS, the term BL/CE is usually used to indicate the implementation of LTE-M1.\n\nIn short, LTE-M1 (BL/CE) is an design / implementation that is to meet the MTC criteria as shown below.\n\nHow is LTE M1 compatitle with legacy LTE ? Actually this can be a pretty fundamental question and help you a lot to understand about LTE M1 and Legay LTE comparison, but I asked this question to myself with more practical reason. When I started to reading LTE M1 3GPP specification (I think it was around Aug 2016), I was eager to try something myself just to understand the specification itself. (I am not such a genious to understand the details just by reading the documents. There has been almost nothing that I got a detailed understanding without hands-on). Of course, at that time there was no LTE M1 device that I could try with and I didn't have any LTE-M1 capable test equipment either. Fortunately, However, I had access to a couple of pretty good toys : a LTE network simulator with super detailed controllability and high performance vector signal analyzer with LTE analysis feature. So my idea was :\n\nAnd with some other reason, I thought I might tweak my super flexible LTE network simulator to act like LTE-M1 eNB at physical layer at least. But the hard reality that I realized was 'it SOUND very similar to legacy LTE, but not same. Not even at the level of similarity where the legacy LTE can be tweaked to emulate a small feature set of LTE-M1'. In short, followings LTE-M1 feature is same as legacy LTE.\n\nIt means if you have LTE-M1 device, you may test with the legacy LTE equipment to check if it can detect the cell and decode physical cell ID and check if it can come up with reasonal measurement of RSRP, RSRQ.\n\nHowever, the similarity ends here. All other things are not compatible with the legacy LTE even if they sound similar. Even for MIB (PBCH), LTE-M1 uses different resource element mapping from legacy LTE (See LTE-M1 PBCH). SIB1 decoding is not compatible either. LTE-M1 SIB1 scheduling is not determined by DCI. It is determined by a single parameter contained in MIB and a set of pretty complex predefined table. On top of it, the physical location of SIB1 hops among multiple locations (i.e, across the multiple narrowband index). See LTE-M1 SIB1 (i.e, SIB1-BR) page for the details. From here (from RACH), the differences diverges even further. The scheduling method is completely different and almost every transmission of PDSCH, PUSCH is being done in very specially designed repeating fashion.\n\nIn short, my final conclusion was to give up the attempt to try LTE-M1 by tweaking the legacy LTE protocol stack and decided to wait until I get a touch on real LTE-M1 device and LTE-M1 equipment. Now (as of Mar 2017) I got access to LTE-M1 test equipment and waiting to get a touch to LTE-M1 UE :)\n\nFollowings are list of the detailed topics. I am assuming that readers already have knowledge on how legacy LTE works and I will describe these topics with focus on the differences from the legacy LTE.",

For that, two procedures have been introduced. The first one is the MBMS bearer coordination independent on broadcasted media procedure to be used when there are multiple MC service servers serving users in one specific area covered with one MBMS bearer, but the servers broadcast media independent of each other. The second procedure is the MBMS bearer coordination within one group call. This one is used when multiple MC service servers of the same kind participate in the same group communication. The MC service servers could be different MC service servers assigned the participating role within one MC system. This feature is specified in 3GPP TS 23.280.\n\nB)\tMBMS bearer event notification: This feature includes an activation of an MBMS bearer and different types of events that may occur during the lifetime of the MBMS bearer. The different events notified to the MC service server include the MBMS bearer start result (e.g. when the first cell successfully allocated MBMS resources), including information if any cells fail to allocate MBMS resources to a specific MBMS bearer, the current status of the MBMS bearer, MBMS bearer suspension/resume or overload scenarios. This feature is specified in 3GPP TS 23.280. Further required aspects to this feature are specified in 3GPP TS 23.468, 3GPP TS 23.246 and 3GPP TS 36.300.\n\nC)\tUse of FEC to protect MBMS transmissions: Application layer FEC (Forward Error Correction) has been introduced as an optional feature to recover the packet losses when delivering a MC service over MBMS. Hence, the required level of QoS can be reached. For that, two procedures on how FEC can be applied for MBMS usage were introduced. This feature is specified in 3GPP TS 23.280. Further required aspects to this feature are specified in 3GPP TS 23.468 and 3GPP TS 23.246.\n\nD)\tHeader compression over MBMS with ROHC: Header compression can decrease the required bandwidth for service communications. Therefore, the support of ROHC (RObust Header Compression) over MBMS has been introduced as an optional feature for the MC service servers and MC service clients. If header compression and FEC are both applied to a communication over MBMS, the header compression has to be performed after the FEC encoding. For that, two procedures on how ROHC can be applied for MBMS usage were introduced. Further required aspects to this feature are specified in 3GPP TS 24.380, 3GPP TS 23.246, 3GPP TS 23.468 and 3GPP TS 36.300.\n\nReferences",

Then, how does eCall differ from what we normally call 'Emergency Call (like 911)' ?\n\nI will explain on the details of this difference later, but simply put, the biggest difference would be the usual 'Emergency call' is a kind of voice call between a human and Emergency Call Center (usually another person in Emergency Call Center)' but 'eCall' is a call between a machine (called IVS : In Vehicle System within an automobile) and Emergency Center;.\n\nFor the persons who likes formal definition, I would quote some descriptions from a couple of international standards as follows :\n\neCall is a manually or automatically initiated emergency call, (TS12 : teleServiceCode 12) from a vehicle, supplemented with a minimum set of emergency related data (MSD), as defined under the EU Commission's eSafety initiative\n\neCall provides reliable full-duplex data communications between IVS and PSAP in addition to emergency voice call (E112) via the cellular network, and can be initiated either automatically or manually. The eCall In-band Modem uses the same voice channel as used for the emergency voice call. eCall allows reliable transmission of MSD alternating with a speech conversation through the existing voice communication paths in cellular mobile phone systems. The expected benefit is that emergency services will be made aware of accidents much more rapidly, will get precise information on location, vehicle type etc. and therefore will be able to reach accident victims faster, with the potential to save many lives annually.\n\nBefore we talk of the technical details of eCall, let's take a 10000-feet overview (high level view) on how eCall go through. You may find a lot of illustrations, cartoons on eCall from internet and following is my own version of illustration. I put the number labels on each of the steps and I would put a short descriptions on what's happening at each step.\n\n(2) eCall is triggered. eCall can be triggered in many ways. It can be triggered automatically by Air Bag or internal sensors. Or a person (e.g, driver) in the car can push the emergency button in the car to trigger the eCall.\n\n(3) The eCall device installed in the car (called IVS : In-Vehicle System) go through Emergency Voice Call setup process to establish the voice call channel. Once the voice call channel is established, the IVS send eCall Data (MSD : Minimal Set of Data) to PSAP (Public Safety Answering Point)\n\n(4) Once the eCall Data(MSD) is received by PSAP, the information would show up automatically on the screen at PSAP center.\n\n(5) The personnel at PSAP center may try voice contact to the person in the car if possible. But there would be many cases where this is not possible when person in the car is injured badly.\n\nFor those who came from Cellular protocol and new to eCall, it would be a little confusing on figuring out the difference between eCall and another type of Emergency Call (like 911 in North America) which we are familiar with in daily life. For those people, I think it would be easier / clearer to explain the difference in terms of overall protocol sequence. Following is my understanding (the image formed in my brain when I first got trained about this).\n\nAs you see here in the following illustration, there is common portions and different portions between eCall and Emergency Call.\n\nNOTE : IVS stands for In-Vehicle System. It is the eCall / Cellular module that are installed within Car (within Telematics module in most case). In terms of testing, this is a DUT\n\neCall Higher Layer Application Protocol (HLAP) is very simple (at least comparting to Cellular Protocol). Actually there is only one critical data to be transferred. The critical data is called MSD(Minimal Set of Data). All the remaining part is just to get MSD delivered to PSAP (Emergency Call Center) with reliability.\n\nAs in Cellular Voice Call, in HLAP there are two different type of call mode depending on who (IVS or PSAP) initiates call. The eCall initiated by IVS is called 'PUSH mode' and this is similar concept as MO(Mobile Originating) call in cellular voice call.\n\nThe eCall initiated by PSAP is called 'PULL mode' and this is similar concept as MT(Mobile Terminating) call in cellular voice call.\n\nThe two illustrations in this section is based on ETSI 103.428 Figure 2. The ETSI diagram is a single diagram showing both PUSH and PULL mode in single sequence. It looked a little confusing to me, so I split the digram into two separate diagram as shown below.\n\nNOTE 1 : IVS stands for In-Vehicle System. It is the eCall / Cellular module that are installed within Car (within Telematics module in most case). In terms of testing, this is a DUT\n\nNOTE 2 : PSAP stands for Public Safety Answering Point. This is a kind of Emergency Call Center.\n\nPSAP PUSH Mode Call is like MO call in celluar terminology. This is the call initiated by IVS (the mobile unit installed inside the car). I think in most case of eCall, the eCall goes in PUSH mode as illustrated below.\n\nPSAP PUSH Mode Call is like MT call in celluar terminology. This is the call initiated by PSAP (the call center). If you compare this with PUSH mode sequence, you would notice that most of the part are same. The only difference is the SEND-MSD (START) signal before the Initiation signal. This is also very much like cellular protocol. If you compare the MO Call and MT Call sequence in cellular protocol, you would notice that most part of the two are almost same. The main difference is that in MT Call the cellular network send 'Paging' (a kind of trigger for UE to initiate the call).\n\nAnother sequence that illustrate the eCall process with a little low layer point of view (especially in terms of LL/HL ACK operation) is shown below. This applies to both PUSH and PULL model.\n\n< ETSI TR 126.969 - Figure 1: Timeline of eCall with IVS initiated signalling and HL-ACK in normal operation >\n\nThere are various timers in eCall protocol which should be met in order to guarantee the normal functionality of the eCall. Some of these timers are an important criterial of testing eCall functionality.\n\nAs mentioned above, the only one fundamental goal for eCall is to deliver MSD(Minimal Set of Data) with reliability. Then you may ask what kind of information is in the MSD. High level description of the imformation in MSD can be find from following description. As you see, the most important information in the MSD is the location data and vehicle information.\n\nThe eCall modem allows to transfer a data message from the IVS over the cellular network to the PSAP which is denoted as eCall MSD. The MSD can include, e.g. vehicle location information, time stamp, number of passengers, Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), and other relevant accident information\n\nThe Minimum Set of Data forming the data component of an eCall sent from a vehicle to a Public Safety Answering Point or other designated emergency call centre. The MSD has a maximum size of 140 bytes and includes, for example, vehicle identity, location information and time-stamp.\n\nBefore we think of this, let's think of why we need to care of this. We should care of this because eCall signaling message and data are delivered in the form of Voice call data of GSM or WCDMA cellular network.\n\nIn GSM / WCDMA, various different types of codecs are used. Basically the codec selection is a job for the specific Radio Access Network equipment(RAN Equipment) that is communicating with the eCall device. The RAN Equipment (Network) would select the codec that would give the best performance in a specific situation. 'Performance' mean 'How fast the eCall data can be delivered' and 'How reliably it can be delivered under a specific channel condition'. It would be too much (or too boring) to present the full details on these performance here. If you are really interested in the details, refer to ETSI TR 126.969 and it would give you a lot of test data for various different Codecs.\n\nIn theory, you can use a live network and PSAP Simulator to test your eCall Device (IVS). But theory is just a theory. You would come across a lot of issues to overcome if you go for this option even though I cannot say it is impossible.\n\nAnother way of testing the eCall device is to construct test setup as described in ETSI 103.428 section 6 Test Configurations. In this document, it is described to use a private cellular network for various Interoperability and Conformance Testing.\n\nThe most practical solution (Test setup) that will be used in the industry would be to use Cellular Network Simulator and PSAP simulator as illustrated below.\n\nAssuming that you have a test setup and you need to determine what to test. As in most of other wireless and cellular device device, you may think of general test that tend to happen during the development or system integration stage. We often call these test in various different name such as function test, integration test or smoke test etc. Usually test specification / procedure tend not to be clearly defined or the procedure changes often depending on situations. Also those test procedure / test item may vary depending on manufacturer. Therefore, it would not be easy to clearly define on what to test for this stage. However, if you just take a close look at the overall eCall protocol, you would easily guess high level test items even without looking into any specification. My personal version of the guess work about the first level test are shown below. You may come up with different idea, but I don't think there would be any big difference between your idea and my idea.\n\nOnce you complete the general function test during development and system integration level and have a stable device, you would forward the device to conformance test. Once you are at the stage of conformance test, you don't have to worry about what to test because a lot of other people (standard body) put a lot of effort and energy and came out with well defined document. In 3GPP/ETSI, those test procedures are defined in ETSI TS 103.428.\n\nAfter completing the conformance, if you are trying to sell the device (acutually Automakers trying to sell cars) in a specific region (e.g, Europe, Asia, America etc), you may need to go through a specific set of test cases specified by the regulatory body in that specific region.\n\nFollowings are the examples of how eCall is being testing during the development or for conformance test before commercialization.\n\nFollowings are the list of the specifications for eCall. I think the most fundamental specifications are CEN documents. But it is not free to get those spec. Recently 3GPP / ETSI has released various specifications. I think most part of the 3GPP specification are based on CEN specification.\n\n: Describes mostly on physical/transport layer design and process of transmitter and reciever.\n\n: This documents describes on API and parameter descriptions of eCall modem protocol stack. It describes on overall software architecture and API prototype but not show the function body. Unless you are developing the protocol stack, you would not need to read this spec.\n\n: This documents describes general logics on eCall Test, but it does not specifies any specific test cases or details of protocol sequence. If you are interested in physical / transport layer level testing, this document would help you to catch the overall test concept.\n\n: If you are interested in high level protocol and function test, this document would help a lot. It shows overall protocol sequence of eCall and decfines specific test sequences. Most of the test in this document (as of V1.1.1 (2016-06)) are based on CEN EN 16062:2015\n\nRoad transport and traffic telematics eSafety eCall minimum set of data - Draft EN 081018\n\nIntelligent transport systems eSafety - Pan European eCall - Operating requirements",

The cases where the procedure is triggered are described in clause 4.\nThe procedure is shown in figure 7.9/3GPP TS 23.108. The network may decide whether to allocate a new TMSI during location updating, and this option is reflected in this example.\nThe mobile station initiates immediate assignment, service request using the LOCATION UPDATING REQUEST message, and contention resolution.\nThe network requires authentication (this again is an option).\nAs the network intends to allocate a new TMSI, it should activate ciphering. The network includes the new TMSI in the LOCATION UPDATING ACCEPT message (it could also use the explicit TMSI reallocation procedure, see clause 4). The mobile station sends a TMSI REALLOCATION COMPLETE message to the network to acknowledge the receipt of the new TMSI. Upon receipt of the TMSI REALLOCATION COMPLETE message the network initiates the channel release if no further transactions are scheduled.\n\n7.3.2\tMobile originating call establishment\nThe mobile station initiates immediate assignment, service request using the CM SERVICE REQUEST message, and contention resolution. The network may initiate authentication and may start the ciphering mode setting.\nAfter sending the CIPHERING MODE COMPLETE message, the mobile station initiates call establishment by sending the SETUP message to the network. The network answers with a CALL PROCEEDING message.\n7.3.3\tMobile terminating call establishment\nMobile terminating call establishment is initiated by the network sending a PAGING REQUEST message (see figure 7.11a/3GPP TS 23.108). Upon receiving this message the mobile station initiates the immediate assignment procedure and responds to the network by sending the PAGING RESPONSE message within a layer 2 SABM frame. The network returns a layer 2 UA frame containing the same information field as was sent in the SABM frame.\n\nAuthentication and ciphering are treated by the network in the same way as defined for the mobile originating call establishment (subclause 7.3.2). After ciphering has been started, the network sends a SETUP message to the mobile station.

The network returns a layer 2 UA frame containing the same information field as was sent in the SABM frame.\n\nAuthentication and ciphering are treated by the network in the same way as defined for the mobile originating call establishment (subclause 7.3.2).

Even though the radio access and the core network signalling in principle supports up to 11 bearers, the UE capability was limited only to 8 data bearers. Since LTE Rel-8 operators have launched a number of new services, and it has become more and more evident that more than 8 radio bearers will be needed to support simultaneously all the services. Without this extension there can be risk of inconsistent end user service behaviour that will ultimately prevent adding further QoS based services for a UE. It also worth noting that LTE Rel-8 has a restriction of having 8 AM bearers or 5AM+3 UM data bearers, which limits further availability for emerging differentiated data services. As an example, there can be user cases and scenarios where up to 4 RLC AM might be needed.\n\nIn response to the aforementioned limitations, TSG RAN agreed to instantiate a new LTE Rel-15 WI aiming to remove those restrictions by increasing the number of supported data radio bearers.\n\nLTE Rel-8 functionality is limited to 8 data radio bearers, which was never revised in later releases. And even though radio access and the core network signalling supports in principle up to 11 data bearers, MAC header design has logical channel ID space only for 8 bearers.\n\nRAN WG2 decided to extend the MAC header logical channel ID space from 32 to 64 code points, which allows for not only extending the number of supported data radio bearers, but also introduces a possibility to add more MAC control elements in the future. After extensive discussions between RAN and SA WGs, it was concluded to extend the number of supported data radio bearers to 15 to minimize impact to the existing information elements on the NAS and CN signalling. It is also worth noting that extended number of LTE data radio bearers is also aligned with the 5G/NR technology, in which the minimum UE requirement is to support 16 data radio bearers.\n\nAs for RAN WG3, it has been concluded that radio access interfaces already can support up to 15 data radio bearers. In addition it, there also exist procedures to handle various error cases when e.g. one eNB does not support as many bearers as has been configured by the source eNB. As a summary, no changes were introduced in RAN WG3.\n\nFinally, it bears mentioning that even though this WI aimed at increasing the number of data radio bearers for LTE connected to EPC, same enhancements can be supported by a UE supporting LTE connected to 5GC, i.e. architecture options 5 and 7. In those deployment cases when both LTE and NR are connected to the same 5GC, it allows operator to deploy and use same services irrespective of the radio access technology that a UE is configured with.",

This will enable broader range of verticals to integrate with 3GPP systems. Currently, multiple northbound API-related specifications already exist (e.g. APIs for Service Capability Exposure Function (SCEF) defined in TS 23.682 [1], APIs for the interface between MBMS service provider and BM-SC defined in TR 26.981 [2]).\n\nFor API consumers or invokers (in particular for 3rd party API developers), a consistent and uniform API framework across multiple northbound API specifications is necessary. In 3GPP Release-15, a Common API Framework (CAPIF) was introduced to support the common API aspects (e.g. authentication, authorization, publishing, discovery, access control policy, etc.), which allows the northbound service APIs to be integrated into CAPIF, such that the API invokers can utilize a single framework for accessing and invoking the 3GPP northbound APIs.\n\nTR 23.722 [3] is a (Stage 2) technical report that analyses existing API frameworks, and identifies requirements and potential architecture solutions to support a common approach for API development within 3GPP, including recommendations for the normative work.\n\nTS 23.222 [4] specifies the (Stage 2) functional architecture model, procedures and information flows needed to support the CAPIF, and guidelines for a consistent development of northbound API (service and CAPIF APIs) in 3GPP.\n\nTS 29.222 [5] specifies the detailed (Stage 3) APIs messages and protocols needed to support CAPIF, based on the Stage 2 functional architecture.\n\nThe CAPIF functional model is illustrated in Figure 2-1. The functional model describes the CAPIF core function (CCF) and API provider domain functions i.e. API exposing function (AEF), API publishing function (APF) and API management function (AMF), and as well as the reference points between these functions and the API invoker/consumer.\n\nThe functional model as described in TS 23.222 [4], specified architecture-level procedures and information flows for common API aspects, including onboarding, offboarding, publishing, unpublishing, update of service APIs, discovery, registration, authentication, authorization, logging, auditing, monitoring, and topology hiding.\n\nIt further specified the application of the functional model to CAPIF deployments (both centralized and distributed deployment), and also CAPIF relationship with network exposure functions defined in 3GPP systems (EPS and 5GS).\n\nThe detailed API specification (Stage 3) supporting the CAPIF functional model is provided in TS 29.222 [5], which translates the procedures and interactions over the reference points into following 9 API services (8 CAPIF core function services and 1 API exposing function service):\n\nReferences\n\n11.2.2\tNorthbound APIs for SCEF - SCS/AS Interworking\n\nSummary based on the input provided by Huawei, HiSilicon in SP-171032.\n\nStarting from Rel-13, 3GPP defined the Service Capabilities Exposure Function (SCEF) framework for exposure of those 3GPP network capabilities to the application domain. However, up until Rel-15, 3GPP specified neither the SCEF functional architecture nor its interactions with Service Capability Servers or Application Servers (SCS/AS), i.e. with the application domain. 3GPP was relying on other standardization fora such as OMA or oneM2M.\n\nTriggered by interactions with oneM2M, 3GPP started with Rel-15 to specify the northbound APIs from SCEF to support oneM2M specifications to facilitate a useable end-to-end M2M architecture.\n\nThe services and capabilities offered by SCEF to Service Capability Servers or Application Servers (application domain) include:\n\nThe interface between the SCEF and the SCS/AS is referred to as \"T8\" interface. This feature specifies the architectural description (including message flows, and parameters) of the T8 interface.\n\nThe T8 interface supports offline and online charging. The charging architecture and scenarios specific to Northbound API, as well as the mapping of the common 3GPP charging architecture onto the Northbound API, are specified in TS 32.240 [2].\n\nThe Northbound API charging architecture, charging principles and scenarios, definition of charging information and content of the CDRs for offline charging are specified in TS 32.254 [3].\n\nThe corresponding AVPs and ASN.1 are specified in TS 32.298 [4] and TS 32.299 [5].\n\nReferences",

In order to achieve wider bandwidth, carrier aggregation (CA) of up to 16 NR carriers is further supported. Both CA within a frequency band (intra-band CA) and CA across frequency bands (inter-band CA) are supported. For the case of inter-band CA, CA with different numerologies, e.g., CA between NR carrier in FR1 and NR carrier in FR2, is also supported.\n\nNR newly defines the concept of bandwidth part (BWP). A UE can be configured with up to four BWPs per NR carrier for DL and UL, respectively. Each BWP has its own parameters including bandwidth and numerology. The bandwidth of the BWP is configured for each UE according to the UE capability on supported maximum bandwidth, and hence multiple UEs having different bandwidth capabilities can be served in a single wideband NR carrier. Also, multiple BWPs with different numerologies can be multiplexed within a single NR carrier to support different types of services. The bandwidth of the BWP can be narrower than the supported maximum bandwidth for the UE so that UE power saving is achieved. In addition, BWP adaptation based on switching between BWPs having different bandwidths and/or numerologies is supported.\n\nFor EN-DC operation, simultaneous UL transmissions across LTE and NR are supported. However, for some band combinations, e.g., band combinations where simultaneous UL transmissions are difficult due to inter-modulation issue, an operation based on single UL transmission i.e., either LTE or NR UL transmission at a time is supported.",

Operators have met this challenge by increasing capacity with new radio spectrum, adding multi-antenna techniques and implementing more efficient modulation and coding schemes.\n\nHowever, these measures alone are insufficient in the most crowded environments and at cell edges where performance can significantly degrade. Operators are also adding small cells and tightly-integrating these with their macro networks to spread traffic loads, widely maintain performance and service quality while reusing spectrum most efficiently.\n\nOne way to expand an existing macro-network, while maintaining it as a homogeneous network, is to \"densify\" it by adding more sectors per eNB or deploying more macro-eNBs. However, reducing the site-to-site distance in the macro-network can only be pursued to a certain extent because finding new macro-sites becomes increasingly difficult and can be expensive, especially in city centres. An alternative is to introduce small cells through the addition of low-power base stations (eNBs, HeNBs or Relay Nodes (RNs)) or Remote Radio Heads (RRH) to existing macro-eNBs. Site acquisition is easier and cheaper with this equipment which is also correspondingly smaller.\n\nSmall cells are primarily added to increase capacity in hot spots with high user demand and to fill in areas not covered by the macro network - both outdoors and indoors. They also improve network performance and service quality by offloading from the large macro-cells. The result is a heterogeneous network with large macro-cells in combination with small cells providing increased bitrates per unit area. See Figure 1.\n\nHeterogeneous network planning was already used in GSM. The large and small cells in GSM are separated through the use of different frequencies. This solution is still possible in LTE. However, LTE networks mainly use a frequency reuse of one to maximize utilization of the licensed bandwidth.\n\nIn heterogeneous networks the cells of different sizes are referred to as macro-, micro-, pico- and femto-cells; listed in order of decreasing base station power. The actual cell size depends not only on the eNB power but also on antenna position, as well as the location environment; e.g. rural or city, indoor or outdoor . The HeNB (Home eNB) was introduced in LTE Release 9 (R9). It is a low power eNB which is mainly used to provide indoor coverage, femto-cells, for Closed Subscriber Groups (CSG), for example, in office premises. See Figure 2.\n\nSpecific to HeNBs, is that they are privately owned and deployed without coordination with the macro-network. If the frequency used in the femto-cell is the same as the frequency used in the macro-cells, and the femto-cell is only used for CSG, then there is a risk of interference between the femto-cell and the surrounding network.\n\nThe Relay Node (RN) is another type of low-power base station added to the LTE R10 specifications. The RN is connected to a Donor eNB (DeNB) via the Un radio interface, which is based on the LTE Uu interface. See Figure 2. When the frequencies used on Uu and Un for the RN are the same, there is a risk of self interference in the RN. From the UE perspective the RN will act as an eNB, and from the DeNB's view the RN will be seen as a UE. As also mentioned, RRHs connected to an eNB via fibre can be used to provide small cell coverage.\n\nIntroducing a mix of cell sizes and generating a heterogeneous network adds to the complexity of network planning. In a network with a frequency reuse of one, the UE normally camps on the cell with the strongest received DL signal (SSDL), hence the border between two cells is located at the point where SSDL is the same in both cells. In homogeneous networks, this also typically coincides with the point of equal path loss for the UL (PLUL) in both cells. In a heterogeneous network, with high-power nodes in the large cells and low-power nodes in the small cells, the point of equal SSDL will not necessarily be the same as that of equal PLUL. See Figure 3.\n\nA major issue in heterogeneous network planning is to ensure that the small cells actually serve enough users. One way to do that is to increase the area served by the small cell, which can be done through the use of a positive cell selection offset to the SSDL of the small cell. This is called Cell Range Extension (CRE). See Figure 4.\n\nA negative effect of this is the increased interference on the DL experienced by the UE located in the CRE region and served by the base station in the small cell. This may impact the reception of the DL control channels in particular.\n\nA number of features added to the 3GPP LTE specification can be used to mitigate the above-mentioned interference problem in heterogeneous networks with small cells:\n\nICIC was introduced in R8. The eNBs can communicate using ICIC via the X2 interface to mitigate inter-cell interference for UEs at the cell edge. The X2AP message used for this is called \"Load Information\". See Figure 5. Through the \"Load Information\" message an eNB can inform neighbouring eNBs about: UL interference level per Physical Resource Block (PRB); UL PRBs that are allocated to cell edge UEs, and hence are sensitive to UL interference; and if DL Tx power is higher or lower than a set threshold value. The eNBs receiving these messages can use the received information to optimize scheduling for UEs at cell edges.\n\nICIC has evolved to better support heterogeneous network deployments -- especially interference control for DL control channels. Enhanced ICIC (eICIC) was introduced in LTE R10. The major change is the addition of time domain ICIC, realized through use of Almost Blank Subframes (ABS). ABS includes only control channels and cell-specific reference signals, no user data, and is transmitted with reduced power. When eICIC is used, the macro-eNB will transmit ABS according to a semi-static pattern. During these subframes, UEs at the edge, typically in the CRE region of small cells, can receive DL information, both control and user data. The macro-eNB will inform the eNB in the small cell about the ABS pattern. See Figure 6.\n\nICIC is evolved in LTE R11 to further enhanced ICIC (feICIC). The focus here is interference handling by the UE through inter-cell interference cancellation for control signals, enabling even further cell range extension.\n\neICIC and feICIC are especially important when Carrier Aggregation (CA) is not used.\n\nCarrier Aggregation (CA) is introduced in R10, with backward compatibility to R8, to increase the total bandwidth available to UEs and hence their maximum bitrates. When CA is used a number of R8 carriers, referred to as Component Carriers (CC), are aggregated and any CA-capable UE can be allocated resources on all CCs, while R8/R9 UEs can only be allocated resources on one CC. Cross-carrier scheduling is an important feature in heterogeneous networks. Using cross-carrier scheduling it is possible to map the Physical DL control channels (PDCCH) on different CCs in the large and small cells. See Figure 7. The PDCCH, carrying DL Control Information (DCI) with scheduling information, must be received by the UEs at the cell edge; PDCCH may be transmitted with higher power than the traffic channels. Hence, using different carriers for the PDCCH in the large and small cells reduces the risk of PDCCH interference.\n\nFrom LTE R11 onwards it is possible to handle CA with CCs requiring different timing advance (TA); for example, combining CCs from eNBs with CCs from RRHs. See Figure 8.\n\nOne way to ensure that a UE is using both the best DL and the best UL carrier in a heterogeneous network is to use CoMP, introduced in LTE R11. With CoMP a number of transmission/reception points (i.e. eNBs, RNs or RRHs) can be coordinated to provide service to a UE - for example, data can be transmitted at the same time in the same PRBs from more than one transmission point to one UE, or data can be received from one transmission point in one subframe and from another transmission point in the next subframe. CoMP can be used both in DL and UL. When CoMP is used in a heterogeneous network a number of macro-cells and small cells can be involved in data transmission to and from one UE. Especially useful in heterogeneous networks is the possibility for a UE in the cell range extension region to utilize the best UL in the small cell and the best DL in the macro-cell. See Figure 9. This, however, requires that the macro-eNB and the base station in the small cell are synchronized, and most likely it will require a combination of macro-eNB with RRHs in the small cell.\n\nFurther enhancements regarding heterogeneous network and small cells are coming in future 3GPP Releases. At the time of writing, Release 12 is still in the process of being formulated with some features in the study phase and others, such as work on interference management for neighbour TDD cells, dual connectivity between the macro cell and small cells, mobility planning within hyper-dense environments and advances in carrier aggregation combinations already in the normative phase (specifications).\n\nFuture updates to this paper will include what has been achieved with the completion of Release 12 during the second half of 2014.\n\n\"...Coordinating the low-power layer of small cells with the macro network improves performance across the entire network while also further boosting efficiencies in spectrum use and power consumption, automating network configuration and optimization. The upcoming 3GPP Release 12 (due to be frozen September 2014) standardises various capabilities in these developments including dual connectivity, small cell on/off and 256 QAM...\" ...Read the full article",

The CTF determines whether the request corresponds to an user / network event (event based charging, e.g. MMS) or whether a session shall be started (session based charging, e.g. IP CAN bearer). Generally, this property is built into the network capability, or service, that the NE provides, and described in the middle tier TSs.\n\nNote that TS 23.078 [207] also specifies online charging capability in the SGSN and MSC based on CAMEL, i.e. using the CAP reference point towards the OCS. This functionality is outside the scope of the present document.\n\nIn event based charging, a network / user event (e.g. MM submission) corresponds to a single chargeable event. In session based charging, at least two chargeable events are needed, one each to describe the start and the end of the session, respectively. Multiple interim events are possible in order to describe changes of session characteristics (e.g. change of IP CAN bearer QoS or change of IMS session media types), or when certain limits, e.g. time or volume, are exceeded. The CTF transforms each chargeable event into a charging event and forwards these charging events to the OCF in real-time.\n\nFor event based charging, the Credit-Control procedure in the OCS may or may not involve reservation of units from the subscriber account, as described in clause 5.1. In the case of event based charging without reservation (IEC):\n\nThe following exceptions and abnormal cases are defined for the IEC scenario:\n\nIf the Credit-Control procedure does involve reservation (ECUR):\n\nThe following exceptions and abnormal cases are defined for the ECUR scenario:\n\nSession based online charging always involves reservation within the Credit-Control procedure (SCUR), as there is no way for the OCS to predict the amount of resource usage that occurs during the user session. To begin with, the CTF forward generates a charging chargeable event that corresponds to the resource usage request and maps onto the user session, and forwards it to the OCF. In the OCS, the online charging session is started and a certain amount reserved from the user subscriber account. This amount is determined by the OCS based on the information in the charging event and on local configuration, i.e. operator policy. A resource usage quota, matching the reserved amount, is then returned by the OCS, at which point the user session starts in the NE. Further charging events are sent from the NE to the OCS upon the detection of further chargeable events within the session .e.g. the expiry of in intervals configured on the NE or instructed by the OCS, or when the authorised quota expires, or when session characteristics change (e.g. change of QoS of an IP CAN bearer). The OCS then furnishes a new quota to the NE as required, or rejects the charging event, e.g. due to expiry of credit on the subscriber account. The OCS also furnishes the NE's behaviour on quota expiry (termination action). When the user session terminates normally in the NE, a final statement on the actually used network resources is returned to the OCS, enabling the OCS to calculate the final value of the actual resource usage session and to properly debit the corresponding final amount from the subscriber account (possibly resulting in a re-crediting of previously reserved amounts). This also terminates the Credit-Control session for the particular user session. The following exceptions and abnormal cases are defined for the SCUR scenario:\n\nIn any of the above cases, the termination of the user session coincides with the termination of the Credit-Control session, e.g. even when a user session is allowed to continue upon account expiry, the Credit-Control session will also continue, but \"zero\" rated.\n\nIt is important for operators to carefully consider the reservation policy on the OCS. On the one hand, if small amounts are reserved, the NE must renew the authorisation very frequently, creating high signalling and processing loads. Additionally, this policy has a comparatively high likelihood of longer, or higher-value, user sessions being forcefully terminated due to expiry of the subscriber account after many small quotas have been used for small chunks of the subscriber session. In contrast, assigning high reservations avoids the above problems, but may interdict the user from the execution of additional, parallel resource usages: due to the high previous reservation, there is no credit left on the account for another resource usage request. The situation described in this paragraph is particularly complex when correlation between multiple charging levels is necessary, see clause 5.3.4. A potential method of relieving this problem is the pooling of credit quotas as described in clause 5.5.2 below.\n\nThe middle tier TSs specify the chargeable events and the content of the associated charging events and responses. TS 32.299 [50] specifies the interface application for the Ro reference point, including the message types and the domain / subsystem / service independent contents of the messages. In addition to the Credit-Control functions, the OCS may also be capable of producing CDRs based on the execution of the above Credit-Control procedures. To this end, the OCS must implement a CDF, and it uses the Ga and Bo reference points to forward its CDRs to a CGF and the CDR files to the BD. These functions of the OCS, however, are outside the scope of 3GPP standardisation.",

The vertical separations are the Ressource Blocks (RB), as defined in the previous section, i.e. a group of 12 subcarriers. The horizontal separations are the OFDM symbols. Four OFDM symbols together with 20 RBs form a so-called \"SS/PBCH (Synchronization Signals/ Physical Broadcast Channel) block\".\n\nThe PSS and NSS are transmitted over 127 subcarriers, i.e. about 10.5 RBs. (They are designed to carry the Physical Cell ID (PCID) selected from 1008 candidates.)\n Once synchronised with the PSS and NSS, the mobiles can retrieve the full SS/PBCH structure, and thus \"listen\" to the Physical Broadcast Channel (PBCH) and its associated Demodulation reference signals (DM-RS).\n\nThe PBCH carries only the minimum system information necessary for initial access, such as system frame number (SFN), initial configurations for PDCCH, PDSCH and DM-RS, and information required to determine the frame timing such as SS/PBCH block index and half-frame index. These are referred to as \"System Information Block 1 (SIB1)\".\n\nOne or multiple SS/PBCH blocks can be transmitted by using transmission beamforming within a half frame, with configurable periodicity from 5 ms to 160 ms. The maximum number of SS/PBCH blocks and the applicable subcarrier spacing for SS/PBCH block transmission are dependent on the frequency range, as shown in Table 5.5.4.3-1.

In particular it may be used in conjunction with test-MSs to ascertain the digital cell \"footprint\", the network integrity and also the network QOS as perceived by the PLMN customers.\n\nThe facility may be used by subscriber administration and network management for subscriber observation, e.g. following a customer complaint or on suspicion of equipment malfunction by the operator or at the request of the police.\n\nAs the amount of information that can be collected for a single call is very large, Network Elements can limit the number of simultaneous traces by either rejecting a trace request or by only producing a sub-set of the information required",

When the Serving RNS (RNS-A) makes the decision to perform the SRNS Relocation procedure it will send an IU-RELOCATION-REQUIRED message to the 3G_MSC (3G_MSCA). The IU-RELOCATION-REQUIRED message shall contain the identifier of the target RNS to which the Relocation is to be performed. When the 3G_MSCA receives the IU-RELOCATION-REQUIRED message it shall begin the process of relocating the serving RNS functionality to the new RNS (RNS-B). The 3G_MSCA shall generate an IU-RELOCATION-REQUEST message to the selected RNS (RNS-B). For the relocation of a speech call to UTRAN Iu mode, 3G_MSCA shall include the NAS Synch Indicator in the Iu-RELOCATION-REQUEST, if the Iu Selected codec to be used after the relocation is different from the Iu Currently used codec.\n\nIf 3G_MSC-A supports SRNS Relocation to a CSG cell and RNS-A includes a CSG ID for the target cell in the IU-RELOCATION-REQUIRED message, then 3G_MSC-A shall check the CSG membership of the UE for the target cell as described in subclause 4.3.1 before generating the Iu-RELOCATION-REQUEST message. If the UE fails the CSG membership check and the target cell is a CSG cell, 3G_MSC-A shall send an IU-RELOCATION-PREPARATION-FAILURE to RNS-A.\nWhen RNS-B receives the IU-RELOCATION-REQUEST message it shall take the necessary action to establish the new Iu transport bearers for each Radio Access Bearer related to 3G_MSCA for the UE in question, this is detailed in the 3GPP TS 25.430 series and 3GPP TS 25.413.\nOnce resource allocation has been completed by RNS-B it shall return an IU-RELOCATION-REQUEST-ACKNOWLEDGE to 3G_MSCA. When this message is received by 3G_MSCA, and 3G_MSCA is ready for the move in Serving RNS functionality, it shall indicate the completion of the preparation phase on the core network side for the SRNS Relocation. An IU-RELOCATION-COMMAND message is sent by 3G_MSCA to RNS-A. RNS-A acts as follows:\n\nWhen the relocation execution trigger is received, RNS-B shall then take the necessary action to assume the role of Serving RNS and shall send an IU-RELOCATION-DETECT message to 3G_MSCA. When the UE is successfully in communication with the RNS-B, then RNS-B shall send an IU-RELOCATION-COMPLETE message to 3G_MSCA.\nAfter 3G_MSCA has received the IU-RELOCATION-COMPLETE message from RNS-B, it shall begin to release the resources associated to the RNS-A. In figures 10 and 11, the resources are released by using the IURELEASECOMMAND sequence.\nIf a failure occurs during the SRNS Relocation attempt, then 3G_MSCA will terminate the relocation to RNS-B. For example, if IU-RELOCATION-FAILURE is returned from RNS-B then 3G_MSCA will terminate the relocation to RNS-B and send IU-RELOCATION-PREPARATION-FAILURE to RNS-A. If IU-RELOCATION-CANCEL is returned from RNS-A, then 3G_MSCA will terminate the relocation to RNS-B and send IU-RELOCATION-CANCEL-ACKNOWLEDGE to RNS-A.\n\nIn all cases the existing connection to the UE shall not be cleared except in the case of expiry of the timer for receipt of Iu-RELOCATION-COMPLETE.\nDuring the period that the UE is not in communication with the network, 3G_MSCA shall queue all appropriate messages. All messages shall be delivered to the UE once communication is resumed. In the case of an Intra-3G_MSC SRNS Relocation (with or without change of  radio resources) on 3G_MSCB, then the messages shall be queued by 3G_MSCB.",

The base requirement was to provide at least the same security features as LTE.\n\nNon-Standalone NR Security\n\nThe NSA architecture uses LTE as the master radio access technology, while the new radio access technology (i.e. NR) serves as secondary radio access technology with User Equipment's (UEs) connected to both radios. Except for capability negotiation, security procedures for EN-DC basically follow the specifications for dual connectivity security for LTE. The WI summary for EDCE5 security (cf. corresponding clause above) provides details.\n\nEvolution of the trust model\n\nMoving on from the Non-Standalone deployment, in a Standalone 5G system, the trust model has evolved. Trust within the network is considered as decreasing the further one moves from the core. This has impact on decisions taken in 5G security design, thus we present the trust model in this section.\n\nThe trust model in the UE is reasonably simple: there are two trust domains, the tamper proof UICC on which the Universal Subscriber Identity Module (USIM) resides as trust anchor and the Mobile Equipment (ME). The ME and the USIM together form the UE.\n\nThe network side trust model for roaming and non-roaming cases are shown in the two following figures respectively, which shows the trust in multiple layers, like in an onion.\n\nThe Radio Access Network (RAN) is separated into distributed units (DU, or gNB-DU) and central units (CU, or gNB-CU) - DU and CU together form the gNB, as seen above. The DU does not have any access to customer communications as it may be deployed in unsupervised sites. The CU and Non-3GPP Inter Working Function (N3IWF - not shown in the figures), which terminates the Access Stratum (AS) security, will be deployed in sites with more restricted access.\n\nIn the Core Network, the Access Management Function (AMF) serves as termination point for Non-Access Stratum (NAS) security. Currently, i.e. in the 3GPP 5G Phase 1 specification, the AMF is collocated with the SEcurity Anchor Function (SEAF) that holds the root key (known as anchor key) for the visited network. The security architecture is defined in a future proof fashion, as it allows separation of the security anchor from the mobility function that could be possible in a future evolution of the system architecture.\n\nThe AUthentication Function (AUSF) keeps a key for reuse, derived after authentication, in case of simultaneous registration of a UE in different access network technologies, i.e. 3GPP access networks and non-3GPP access networks such as IEEE 802.11 Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN). Authentication credential Repository and Processing Function (ARPF) keeps the authentication credentials. This is mirrored by the USIM on the side of the client, i.e. the UE side. The subscriber information is stored in the Unified Data Repository (UDR). The Unified Data Management (UDM) uses the subscription data stored in UDR and implements the application logic to perform various functionalities such as authentication credential generation, user identification, service and session continuity etc. Over the air interface, both active and passive attacks are considered on both control plane and user plane. Privacy has become increasingly important leading to permanent identifiers being kept secret over the air interface.\n\nIn the roaming architecture, the home and the visited network are connected through SEcurity Protection Proxy (SEPP) for the control plane of the internetwork interconnect. This enhancement is done in 5G because of the number of attacks coming to light recently such as key theft and re-routing attacks in SS7 and network node impersonation and source address spoofing in signalling messages in DIAMETER that exploited the trusted nature of the internetwork interconnect.\n\n5G Phase 1 Security (Release 15)\n\n5G Phase 1 brings several enhancements to LTE security, some of the key points are presented in this section. Details of 5G Phase 1 security can be found in TS 33.501 [1].\n\nPrimary authentication: Network and device mutual authentication in 5G is based on primary authentication. This is similar to LTE but there are a few differences. The authentication mechanism has in-built home control allowing the home operator to know whether the device is authenticated in a given network and to take final call of authentication. In 5G Phase 1 there are two mandatory authentication options: 5G Authentication and Key Agreement (5G-AKA) and Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)-AKA', i.e. EAP-AKA'. Optionally, other EAP based authentication mechanisms are also allowed in 5G - for specific cases such as private networks. Also, primary authentication is radio access technology independent, thus it can run over non-3GPP technology such as IEEE 802.11 WLANs.\n\nSecondary authentication: Secondary authentication in 5G is meant for authentication with data networks outside the mobile operator domain. For this purpose, different EAP based authentication methods and associated credentials can be used. A similar service was possible in LTE as well, but now it is integrated in the 5G architecture.\n\nInter-operator security: Several security issues exist in the inter-operator interface arising from SS7 or Diameter [5,6] in the earlier generations of mobile communication systems. To counter these issues, 5G Phase 1 provides inter-operator security from the very beginning.\n\nPrivacy: Subscriber identity related issues have been known since LTE and earlier generations of mobile systems. In 5G a privacy solution is developed that protects the user's subscription permanent identifier against active attacks. A home network public key is used to provide subscriber identity privacy.\n\nService based architecture (SBA): The 5G core network is based on a service based architecture, which did not exist in LTE and earlier generations. Thus 5G also provides adequate security for SBA.\n\nCentral Unit (CU) - Distributed Unit (DU): In 5G the base-station is logically split in CU and DU with an interface (the F1) between them. Security is provided for the CU-DU interface. This split was also possible in LTE, but in 5G it is part of the architecture that can support a number of deployment options (e.g. co-located CU-DU deployment is also possible). The DUs, which are deployed at the very edge of the network, don't have access to any user data when confidentiality protection is enabled. Even with the CU-DU split, the air interface security point in 5G remains the same as in LTE, namely in the radio access network.\n\nKey hierarchy: The 5G hierarchy reflects the changes in the overall architecture and the trust model using the security principle of key separation. One main difference in 5G compared to LTE is the possibility for integrity protection of the user plane.\n\nMobility: Although mobility in 5G is similar to LTE, the difference in 5G is the assumption that the mobility anchor in the core network can be separated from the security anchor.\n\nReferences",

In a previous Rel-14 work item IQoE [1], this QoE functionality was enhanced for the DASH streaming specification TS 26.247 [2], giving the operator better possibilities to control such metrics feedback. The current Rel-15 work item EQoE_MTSI [3] introduced the same enhancements also to the MTSI specification TS 26.114 [4], keeping the QoE functionalities for DASH and MTSI services aligned.\n\nThe enhancements introduced by EQoE_MTSI in TS 26.114 are:\n\nReferences\n\nSummary based on the input provided by China Unicom, Huawei, China Telecom in RP-172192 revised in RP-181821.\n\nThe benefit of understanding customers' experience, e.g. throughput, data loss, latency, for streaming services has attracted operators' attention. ITU-T P.NATS has released the standards on the model and evaluation of MOS models for streaming services in December 2016. SA4 has specified information about Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP, DASH, services to be collected from the DASH application on the UE and agreed to support MDT enhancement option for both QoE metrics configuration and QoE metrics reporting [1].A WI on QoE Measurement Collection for streaming services in UTRAN was approved at RAN#73 and a 'container based solution' has been specified [2]. SA5 has studied the management solution for collection of QoE information and proposed use cases, potential requirements and possible solutions. A WI was approved to specify the function Management of QoE measurement collection [3].\n\nBased on the work above, the operators can collect and utilize the QoE measurement information of streaming services to better understand the user experience and optimize their network in E-UTRAN. This work item specified the core requirement for Quality of Experience (QoE) Measurement Collection for streaming services in E-UTRAN [4].\n\nThis feature enables the network to collect QoE measurement information from the UE. The feature is activated by Trace Function from the MDT framework. Both signalling based and management based initiation cases are allowed. For the signalling based case, the QoE Measurement Collection is initiated towards a specific UE from CN nodes using the MDT mechanism; for the management based case, the QoE Measurement Collection is initiated from OAM targeting an area (without targeting a specific UE).\n\nThe QoE measurement configuration from OAM or CN in E-UTRAN is included in a container of RRCConnectionReconfiguration message and forwarded to the UE similar to in UTRAN. For transferring the QoE measurement report, a new SRB4 and a new uplink RRC message \"application layer measurement report\" are introduced. SRB4 is configured via RRCConnectionReconfiguration meassage. A container in the new message is defined to send the QoE measurement report.\n\nThe QoE measurement configuration and measurement reporting are supported in RRC_CONNECTED state only. E-UTRAN can release the QoE measurement configuration towards the UE at any time. If not explicitly released by the eNB, QoE measurement will be continued in case of intra-eNB HO and inter-eNB HO and both source and target cell belong to defined same measurement reporting area.\n\nReferences",

The split of control plane and user plane via E1 interface enhances the split between gNB-CU (gNB central unit) and gNB-DU (gNB distributed unit) defined within the NR WI. It offers the possibility of:\n\n(1) optimizing the location of different RAN functions based on the deployment scenario, (2) support efficient radio resource isolation for network slicing, (3) independent scaling of CP and UP capacity.\n\nIn the NR WI, a split of the gNB into a gNB-CU and a gNB-DU is defined. The gNB-CU hosts the RRC, SDAP and PDCP radio protocols, while the gNB-DU hosts the PHY, MAC and RLC radio protocols. The gNB-CU and the gNB-DU are connected via the F1 interface. This WI complements the split defined in the NR WI by enabling to split the gNB-CU into a gNB-CU-CP and a gNB-CU-UP. The gNB-CU-CP hosts the RRC and the instance of the PDCP protocol serving the control plane, while the gNB-CU-UP hosts the SDAP and the instance of the PDCP protocol serving the user plane. The gNB-CU-CP and the gNB-CU-UP are connected via the E1 interface. The gNB-CU-CP is connected to the gNB-DU via the control plane part of the F1 interface (F1-C), while the gNB-CU-UP is connected to the gNB-DU via the user plane part of the F1 interface (F1-U). The resulting gNB architecture inclusive of both the CU-DU split and the CP-UP split, is illustrated in Figure 12.1-1.\n\nThe architecture shown in Figure 1 enables the following deployment scenarios [2]:\n\nThe call-flows showing the most relevant procedures involving the E1 interface (e.g., initial UE attach, handover, bearer context setup and release) are captured in TS 38.401 [3]. The E1 functions and procedures are described in TS 38.460 [4]. The E1 physical layer and the signalling transport, which is based on the SCTP/IP protocol stack, are described respectively in TS 38.461 [5] and TS 38.462 [6]. The E1 application protocol (E1AP) is specified in TS 38.463 [7] and includes the description of: (1) the E1 interface management procedures, which allow to setup the E1 interface and to exchange the relevant configuration data between a gNB-CU-CP and a gNB-CU-UP; (2) the bearer context management procedures, which allow to setup and configure user plane resources to serve UEs.\n\nReferences\n\n12.1.2\tManagement Enhancement for EPC Control and User Plane Separation (CUPS)\n\nSummary based on the input provided by Huawei in SP-190029.\n\nThis work item specified management enhancements to support EPC CUPS, including performance measurements related to split S/P-GW architecture in TS 32.426, EPC Network Resource Model (NRM) Integration Reference Point (IRP) Information Service (IS) and Solution Set (SS) modifications in TS 28.708 and TS 28.709.\n\nThis work item implemented the conclusion of the study on Management Enhancement of CUPS of EPC Nodes (FS_MECUPS).

Even though the radio access and the core network signalling in principle supports up to 11 bearers, the UE capability was limited only to 8 data bearers. Since LTE Rel-8 operators have launched a number of new services, and it has become more and more evident that more than 8 radio bearers will be needed to support simultaneously all the services. Without this extension there can be risk of inconsistent end user service behaviour that will ultimately prevent adding further QoS based services for a UE. It also worth noting that LTE Rel-8 has a restriction of having 8 AM bearers or 5AM+3 UM data bearers, which limits further availability for emerging differentiated data services. As an example, there can be user cases and scenarios where up to 4 RLC AM might be needed.\n\nIn response to the aforementioned limitations, TSG RAN agreed to instantiate a new LTE Rel-15 WI aiming to remove those restrictions by increasing the number of supported data radio bearers.\n\nLTE Rel-8 functionality is limited to 8 data radio bearers, which was never revised in later releases. And even though radio access and the core network signalling supports in principle up to 11 data bearers, MAC header design has logical channel ID space only for 8 bearers.\n\nRAN WG2 decided to extend the MAC header logical channel ID space from 32 to 64 code points, which allows for not only extending the number of supported data radio bearers, but also introduces a possibility to add more MAC control elements in the future. After extensive discussions between RAN and SA WGs, it was concluded to extend the number of supported data radio bearers to 15 to minimize impact to the existing information elements on the NAS and CN signalling. It is also worth noting that extended number of LTE data radio bearers is also aligned with the 5G/NR technology, in which the minimum UE requirement is to support 16 data radio bearers.\n\nAs for RAN WG3, it has been concluded that radio access interfaces already can support up to 15 data radio bearers. In addition it, there also exist procedures to handle various error cases when e.g. one eNB does not support as many bearers as has been configured by the source eNB. As a summary, no changes were introduced in RAN WG3.\n\nFinally, it bears mentioning that even though this WI aimed at increasing the number of data radio bearers for LTE connected to EPC, same enhancements can be supported by a UE supporting LTE connected to 5GC, i.e. architecture options 5 and 7. In those deployment cases when both LTE and NR are connected to the same 5GC, it allows operator to deploy and use same services irrespective of the radio access technology that a UE is configured with.",

CCCH is bidirectional which means both for downlink and uplink.\n\nAnother tip of understanding this diagram is to correlate this diagram to MAC PDU structure of each channel that is following this diagram (In 25.321, they are quite a far apart.. so you may lose mental connection between the two).\n\nThe end result of most of the procedure shown in the above figure is adding or removing a special portions in MAC header.\n\nThe first path we are thinking of is PCCH path which is downlink only and carries Paging message (Paging Type 1). 25.321 9.2.1.3 MAC header for PCCH says \"There is no MAC header for PCH\". (The spec says PCH would have MAC-ehs when the PCH is mapped on HS-DSCH, but this does not happen in the MAC component being discussed in this section).\n\nNext path is BCCH path which is downlink only and carries MIB and SIBs. It can create one of the following three cases, but the case produced by the MAC component shown in this section is Case a) which does not have any MAC header. I means that it is going through TCTF MUX block without any modification. (Refer to 25.321 9.2.1.2 MAC header for BCCH for case b) and case c).\n\nEven though PCCH, BCCH path does not have any MAC header in this process and MAC layer still do something for this channel. It is TFC (Transport format Combination) Selection. MAC-c/sh select a proper TFCI and pass it to transport layer and then the transport layer encode PCH, BCH data into PHY layer format.\n\nNext Path is RACH to CCCH path (Uplink) and CCCH to FACH path (downlink). RRC Connection Request is going through RACH to CCCH path and RRC Connection Setup is going through CCCH to FACH path. This path is dealing with the following MAC PDU structure. In CCCH to FACH path, MAC-c/sh adds TCTF to MAC SDU. In RACH to CCCH path, MAC-c/sh check TCTF value and remove it and then distribute the SDU accordingly to higher layer.\n\n< 25.321 - Table 9.2.1.2 : Coding of the Target Channel Type Field on FACH for FDD >\n\n< 25.321 - Table 9.2.1.4 : Coding of the Target Channel Type Field on RACH for FDD >\n\nFollowing is MAC-c/sh/m for UE side, but analysis logic and most of the detailed information is same as in UTRAN. The only thing you have to be careful about is direction of the path. For example, in this case, PCCH path is from the bottom (PCH) to UP (PCCH). CCCH path is also 'FACH to CCCH' or 'CCCH to RACH' which is opposite direction of UTRAN case.",

When switched on, the model modifies the AoAs of the paths arriving at the subscriber unit.  It is for use in both the urban macro and urban micro scenarios.\n\nUrban-canyons exist in dense urban areas served by macro-cells, and for at-rooftop micro-cells.  When this model is used, the spatial channel for all subscribers in the simulated universe will be defined by the statistical model given below.  Thus for the SCM channel generation steps given in Clause 5.3, Step 9 is replaced with steps 9a-d given below, which describe the AoAs of the paths arriving at the subscriber in the urban canyon scenario.\n\nThe following procedure is used to determine the subscriber mean AoAs of the six paths.  This model does not use a building grid, but assigns angles based on statistical data presented in the figures below.  The procedure is defined in terms of the subscriber terminal:\n\nStep 9a. Select a random street orientation from: U(0, 360˚) which also equals the direction of travel for the UE.\n\nStep 9b. Select a random orientation for the subscriber antenna array from U(0, 360).\n\nStep 9c. Given  the predefined fraction of UEs to experience the urban canyon effect, Select a uniform random draw for the parameter .\n\nStep 9d. If   select the UE AoAs for all arriving paths to be equal, with 50% probability of being from the direction of the street orientation obtained in step 9a, and 50% the street orientation plus an offset of 180.  If  select the directions of arrival for all paths using the standard SCM UE AoA model given in Clause 5.3, step 9.\n\nIn Figure 5.3, the urban canyon procedure is simulated to show the effects of the model on the composite UE angle spread.  The parameter , which describes the percentage of mobiles that will experience the urban canyon effects.  The figure illustrates the result of selecting the AoAs, where each of the paths has a fixed 35˚ angle spread.\n\nThe parameter , is set to a relatively high percentage of occurrence to emphasize the urban canyon effects, while the remaining occurrences assume some mixed arrivals to model various other conditions such as cross streets or where signals arrive from between buildings or from unknown paths at various angles.",

SUPL operations must take place in combination with control-plane procedures over NRPPa.\n\nThis situation could arise in the case of UE-assisted OTDOA, for example, in which the SLP needs to provide the UE (in a SUPL session) with assistance data supplied by the NG-RAN. This clause uses a UE-assisted OTDOA positioning operation as an example.\n\nAlthough the positioning server in this operation is the SLP, the existence of an interface to the LMF means that the SLP can communicate with the LMF via the SPC. In particular, this means that assistance data that was delivered to the LMF via NRPPa can be transferred over to the SLP for delivery to the UE via LPP over SUPL.\n\nThere are several ways to realise this general behaviour. In the simplest case, the LMF could be supplied with the necessary assistance data in advance, so that it can be supplied to the SLP without any actual NRPPa procedures taking place in real time (and possibly even before the positioning transaction begins).\n\nIn the event that the LMF does not have the required assistance data available, it would need to retrieve them from the NG-RAN once it was made aware that they were needed.\n\nIn both cases, it should be noted that the retrieval of the assistance data is transparent to the UE and to the actual SUPL session. This model is parallel to the approach used with A-GNSS, in which assistance data such as satellite ephemerides are retrieved from sources entirely external to the cellular network. For purposes of LPP over SUPL, the delivery of assistance data to the SLP can be viewed as an independent external process.\n\nThe delivery of assistance data to the UE, however, takes place through the same mechanisms as control-plane LPP, transported through SUPL.\n\nAnnex B (informative):\nChange history",

LTE radio network dimensioning is typically optimized for data services. To avoid negative impacts on user experience for VoLTE subscribers in areas with weak LTE coverage, a handover to 2G or 3G is performed sooner, i.e. at a higher RSRP level, for UEs with established voice bearers compared to UEs with only data bearers.\n\nAs in the Technical Specification for Multimedia Telephony Service over IMS (MTSI), TS 26.114, which is used as basis for the GSMA IR.92 VoLTE profile, there have been several tools for increased robustness of speech calls with initial selection of Codecs and their Configuration and in-call dynamic rate and mode adaptation and application layer redundancy. EVS (Enhanced Voice Services), especially the EVS Channel Aware mode, demonstrates higher robustness against transmission errors than AMR and AMR-WB codecs.\n\nBased on the above provided background and depending on network dimensioning, which typically targets at data services, the VoLTE coverage may be a function of the selected codec and its configuration, its rate adaptation, and potentially the applied application layer redundancy, as well as the required QoS of the VoLTE bearer. It is adopted that a new QoS parameter Maximum Packet Loss Rate in UL and DL directions is defined and sent from PCRF to eNB. At reception of the IMS service information from the P-CSCF, if configured through policy, the PCRF determines the Maximum Packet Loss Rate for UL and DL based on the IMS service information e.g. codec and sends it to PCEF along with the PCC rule for the voice media. This parameter is transferred to the eNB to support it for handover threshold decision.\n\nBased on the analysis/evaluation of this eVoLP WID, the existing 3GPP 4G specifications TS 23.401, 23.203 and 5G specifications TS 23.501, 23.502, 23.503 have been modified according to it.\n\nReferences",

I don't think it is complicated because UMTS MAC is doing more things than LTE MAC. (In terms of functionalility, I think LTE MAC is doing more than UMTS MAC). I think most of the complexity of UMTS MAC structure come from the design and the complexity of the transport channel.\nOften, things get very confusing and as a result log analysis/troubleshooting gets very tricky. Followins are the topics that will be covered in this page.\n\nAs you see in 25.321 - Figure 4.2.4.1 (Overview on MAC Layer in UTRAN), regardless of whether it is for R99, HSDPA(R5), HSUPA(R6), HSPA+ (R7), every MAC data goes through MAC-d sublayer somewhere along it's path. However the data flow within this sublayer differs among R99, R5, R6, R7 and differs depending on whether it is uplink (From UE to UTRAN) or downlink (From UTRAN to UE).\n\nTo help you understand the path for each case, I colored the figure from 25.321 according to each of the case.\n\nRed path represent the case for R99 and it applies to both Uplink and downlink. But when you want to follow the uplink path, you have to read the figure from bottom to top and for downlink you have to read from top to bottom. The important thing to remember is that for R99 MAC-d is a whole of MAC layer and the MAC flow does not go through any further processing.\n\nBlue path indicate the path for HSDPA(R5) and HSPA+(R7). As you see, the data for HSDPA, HSPA+ goes through MAC-d with a very little processing and are passed to MAC-hs (HSDPA) or MAC-ehs(HSPA+) for further detailed processing. You will go back to this processing later in this section.\n\nGreen path shows the path for HSUPA, meaning this is an uplink path. You have to follow from bottom (from the point labeled 'from MAC-es/MAC-is) to top.\n\nAs you see in Figure 4.2.3.1 (Overview on MAC Layer in UE), regardless of whether it is for R99, HSDPA(R5), HSUPA(R6), HSPA+ (R7), every MAC data goes through MAC-d sublayer somewhere along it's path.

(Note that this PDU applies only to R99 MAC PDU and does not apply to HSDPA, USUPA PDU. ) This is a generic format which contains all the possible fields in the header, but depending on logical channels and mapping type, the header structure gets different. We will see the details for each specific cases in next section.\n\nThe purpose of this field is to indicate the logical channel type (class) and meaning and number of bits for this field differs depending on the logical channel type. (Refer to Table 9.2.1.1, 9.2.1.2, 9.2.1.4 for the details. These tables are all from 3GPP 25.321)\n\nThis field indicate UE ID type.

It is extremly simple and lightweight messaging protocol based on publish / subscribe mechanism.\n\nIn case of current high bandwidth connection (like ordinary internet, WiFi, Cellular), we already have so wide varieties of protocols like http, ftp, sip etc. Most of these protocols is generating relatively large traffic even though it can be considered as almost nothing with recent broadband communication technology and it would not be a big issue even with IoT devices if the devices is based on celluar network (e.g, WCDMA or LTE). However, this kind of protocol can cause untolerable amount of traffic for the devices that is based on very low throughput and small sized packet system like 6LoWPAN. For this kind of low throughput/small packet based system, we would need very light , simple and small sized application layer protocol. MQTT is one of the most popular protocol that meets this requirement.\n\nFor learning any kind of protocol, my personal approach is almost always same. To understand the packet (or frame) structure and then following through a couple of example protol sequences line by line. Sometimes I practice decoding the captured hex stream by hand based on Packet Structure specification. I will do the same thing here.\n\nProtocol Sequence of MQTT is very simple as illustrated below. First, Client (IoT End Device) request connection to a Broker (a kind of server). If the connection accepted, the device (client) would send 'SUBSRIBE' message saying \"I want to get this and this kind of data. So please send me the data whenever those data is upadated on your side (Broker)\". If this request is accepted by Broker, the broker would send the data to the device whenever any new data comes into the database. For more details on profocol sequence, see 'Protocol Sequence' section. For more details on the structure and contents of each message, refer to Packet structure section.\n\nEven though the description and examples came from myself, the packet structure shown here is based on MQTT V3.1 Protocol Specification by International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) Eurotech. Format representation is modified a little bit for easier understanding for myself.\n\nFollowing is one example protocol sequence that I captured from my trial with HiveMQ Websocket Client. You may get a little bit different variations if you try on your own, but overall procedure and message structure would be similar to the example shown here. Give it a try on your own and you will get used to it very quickly. MQTT is one of the simplest protocol you can see in wireless communication area and I think this would be the biggest reason why MQTT is adopted as one of the dominant protocols in IoT.\n\nYes, Try with HiveMQ Websocket Client. This is what I used to capture the most of sample log for this page.",

    "context": "https://www.sharetechnote.com/html/Communication_ErrorCorrection.html\n\nComm. Tech.: Error Correction\n\nThere are many cases where we have to seriously consider 'Error'. Actually in almost every data processing and communications error handling is one of the most critical part of the process.\n\nSeveral common examples of the case where some form of error handling is used are as follows :\n\nYou would realize that most of digital data processing or communication would have not be realized if there is no mechism for error handling (error detection and correction)\n\nFirst let's think of the definition of 'Error'. What is 'Error' ? It is simple. Error can be defined as 'any difference between the transmitted data and received data'. This may sound specific only to communication. In case of data storage, you can define Error as 'any difference between the data being sent for writing and the data really written on a media (e.g, Hard Disk, Memory\nor CD).'\n\nOnce Error happened, we need to have some mechanism to figure out 'whether there exists any error' or 'exactly where is the error occured'. This mechanism of finding the existence of error is called 'Error Detection'. If we know the exact contents of transmitted data, it would be very simple to find out the location of errors. Just simply by comparing the transmitted data\nand received data, we can easily find the location of errors. However in realty, we don't know what is the transmitted data (original data). So we have to figure out the location of errors only from the received data. This is why Error detection is not so simple.\n\nOf course, the second type is better in most case since it will give a chance for error recovery. But in most cases, this second type tend to be more complicated to be implemented or requires more overhead for data transfer. This is why the first type of mechanism is still being used in many applications.\n\nWhat is Error Correction ? The definition is simple.. (only Algorithm is complicated :). Definition of Error Correction is to fixing the error bit (data) to normal bit (data).\n\nWhatever you do, there is no way to prevent any error. The only thing you can do for those errors is to come out with the various methods of detecting and fixing those errors. For this detection/correction, method we need to go through roughly following procedures.\n\ni) Convert (organize) the original data into a special structure in such a way that the reciever can easily detect the error. (This happens on Transmitter side).\n\niv) Check if there is any error in the received data. This is called Error Detection and happens in the reciever side.\n\nv) If errors are found in step iv), ask for retransmission (ARQ case) or try to recover(fix) the error (FEC or HARQ case). This happens in reciever side.\n\nWhen we talk about Error Detection or Correction (step v), we normally explain about step i) as well because the error detection/correction methods varies depending on step i).\n\nIn this section, I will briefly explain about several most common methods for step i) and iv), v) that are used for data communication.\n\nIf you convert data into binary stream and count the number of '1' in the data, it would be only one of two cases.. the total count of '1' is Even or Odd. In Parity Check method, transmitter reorganize the original data so that the total number of '1' is only Even (Even Parity) or only Odd (Odd Parity). Following is the example process for 'Even Parity' algorithm.\n\nThis is very simple and still being used in some simple data communication like RS 232 Serial communication. But this is detection only algorithm and it cannot correct error. Even for detection, there are many cases where this algorithm fail to detect errors. (Try think of those cases where this algorithm fails)\n\nThe concept and method of Two Dimensional Parity check is almost the same as the simple parity check explained above. The only difference is that in this algorithm we convert the data into a 2 dimensional array and apply parity bits horizontal and vertical direction as illustrated below.\n\nIn Checksum algorithm, we calculate a special number called 'checksum' value from the original data and add the checksum data to the transmitted data. When the reciever get the data, it calculate the checksum value from the received data and compares the calculated value with the received checksum value.\n\nDefinately it looks more complicated than Parity Algorithm, but it is more robust in finding errors. This is also detection only algorithm.\n\nMost common application of this algorithm is IP transmission. If you decode any IP packet decoded in wireshark, you would see the checksum field in every packet.\n\nAs in CheckSum algorithm, in CRC algorithm .. the transmitter calculate special number called CRC bits as shown in the following example and attach the value at the end of the original data and send it. When the reciever get the data, it calculate the CRC value from the received data and compares the calculated value with the CRC value.\n\nThe value m and n varies depending on cases. Normally, a standards for a specific communication technolgy (e.g, 3GPP in case of WCDMA, LTE) predefines these value.\n\nOne of the critical thing is how you determine \"Generator Function\" (sometimes called 'Divisor'). This would require deep mathematical knowledge on Field Theory.. but fortunately you don't have to pull your hair trying to determine this because the international standard in your industry would specify these functions :)\n\nNext important and confusing step would be step s3. One example is as follows. (For more practical example using less scary mathematics -:), see CRC page)\n\nHere goes a couple of example of Generator Function that is used in various communication system.\n\nThe Generator Function that is used in LTE is shown below. (3GPP 36.211 5.1.1 CRC calculation)\n\nThe Generator Function that is used in UMTS is shown below. (3GPP 25.212 4.2.1.1 CRC Calculation)\n\nWhat a system (two communicating parties) do if the reciever find (detect) an error ? We see roughly three different mode of operations depending on what kind of error handling mechanism the system uses as listed below.\n\nIn ARQ, the reciever ask for retransmission of exactly the same data by sending Nack or by skipping any Ack to the transmitter. If the transmitter does get Nack or does not get Ack within a certain time frame, it automatically retransmit the exactly the same data that was transmitted before. The advantage of this mechanism would be that it is simple to implement and it only has to implement\nerror detection algorithm and does not implement the error correction algorithm. The disadvantage would be that the transmiter would have to send the same data so many times if the channel condition is bad and the reciever keep detecting errors. Most common examples for this mechanism would be IP data or RLC layer transmission in WCDMA, LTE.\n\nIn FEC, transmitter encode the data before transmitssion in such a way that the reciever not only detect the error but also recover the error unless the amount of the error exceeds a certain level. In this case, the reciever does not request retransmission, in stead it recover (correct) errors from the redundancy bits and specially designed structure contained in the received data itself.\nThe advantage of this mechanis is obvious. It is that we don't need retransmission even when there is error. The disadvantage is that it can recover the error up to only a certain level, if there is more errors exceeding the specific level it is impossible to recover error. In order to enable more capability of error correction, we have to put more redundency bits in the transmitted data, meaning it would increase overhead.\n\nHARQ has the property of both ARQ and FEC. It is a kind of Hybrid algorithm and it is where the name come from. It is Hybrid of ARQ and FEC. When the reciever got a data with error, furst it tries to recover (correct) the error with FEC algorithm. If the error correct was successful, it send Ack to the sender. If it fails, it sends Nack to sender. When the sender got the Nack (or no response)\nfrom the reciever, it retransmit the data but when it retransmit the data, it usually send a little bit different sets of the original data (we call it 'different redundency version') and the reciever combines the previous copy and the retransmitted copy to increase probability of error recovery. The advantage of this algorithm is that it adopts the advantage of both ARQ and FEC and reducing the disadvantage of FEC and ARQ. But this would be more complicated to implement than simple ARQ and FEC. One common example\nof this mechanism is Physical layer communication in HSDPA and LTE.

The position information may be requested by and reported to a client (e.g., an application) associated with the UE, or by a client within or attached to the core network. The position information shall be reported in standard formats, such as those for cell-based or geographical co-ordinates, together with the estimated errors (uncertainty) of the position and velocity of the UE and, if available, the positioning method (or the list of the methods) used to obtain the position estimate.\n\nRestrictions on the geographic shape encoded within the 'position information' parameter may exist for certain LCS client types. The 5GS, including NG-RAN, shall comply with any shape restrictions defined in 5GS and, in a particular country, with any shape restrictions defined for a specific LCS client type in relevant national standards. For example, in the US, national standard J-STD-036-C-2 restricts the geographic shape for an emergency services LCS client to minimally either an \"ellipsoid point\" or an \"ellipsoid point with uncertainty circle\" as defined in TS 23.032 [4].\n\nIt shall be possible for the majority of the UEs within a network to use the LCS feature without compromising the radio transmission or signalling capabilities of the NG-RAN.\n\nThe uncertainty of the position measurement shall be network-implementation-dependent, at the choice of the network operator. The uncertainty may vary between networks as well as from one area within a network to another. The uncertainty may be hundreds of metres in some areas and only a few metres in others. In the event that a particular position measurement is provided through a UE-assisted process, the uncertainty may also depend on the capabilities of the UE. In some jurisdictions, there is a regulatory requirement for location service accuracy that is part of an emergency service. Further details of the accuracy requirements can be found in TS 22.071 [3].\n\nThe uncertainty of the position information is dependent on the method used, the position of the UE within the coverage area and the activity of the UE. Several design options of the NG-RAN system (e.g., size of cell, adaptive antenna technique, pathloss estimation, timing accuracy, ng-eNB and gNB surveys) shall allow the network operator to choose a suitable and cost-effective UE positioning method for their market.\n\nThere are many different possible uses for the positioning information. The positioning functions may be used internally by the 5GS, by value-added network services, by the UE itself or through the network, and by \"third party\" services. The feature may also be used by an emergency service (which may be mandated or \"value-added\"), but the location service is not exclusively for emergencies.\n\nDesign of the NG-RAN positioning capability as documented in this specification includes position methods, protocols and procedures that are either adapted from capabilities already supported for E-UTRAN, UTRAN and GERAN, or created separately from first principles. In contrast to GERAN and UTRAN but similarly to E-UTRAN, the NG-RAN positioning capabilities are intended to be forward compatible to other access types and other position methods, in an effort to reduce the amount of additional positioning support needed in the future. This goal also extends to user plane location solutions such as OMA SUPL ([15], [16]), for which NG-RAN positioning capabilities are intended to be compatible where appropriate.\n\nAs a basis for the operation of UE Positioning in NG-RAN, the following assumptions apply:",

The location information for each MS is stored in functional units called location registers. Functionally, there are two types of location registers:\nSee also 3GPP TS 23.002 where the network architecture is described, and 3GPP TS 23.008 where the data stored in the location registers are described.\nThe action taken by a MS in order to provide location information to the PLMN will be referred to as location updating.\n2.2\tLocation area and MSC area\nThe MSC area is composed of the area covered by all base stations controlled by the MSC. An MSC area may consist of several location areas. A location area is an area in which, after having performed a location update once, MSs may roam without being required to perform subsequent location updates for reason of location change. A location area consists of one or more cells.\n\nFor further details of the network architecture, see 3GPP TS 23.002.\n2.3\tLocation area identification\nThe Location Area Identification (LAI) plan is part of the base station identification plan. The base stations are identified uniquely (see 3GPP TS 23.003).\n2.4\tIMSI detach/attach operation\nThe support of IMSI detach/attach operation is mandatory in MSs. The facility is optional in the fixed infrastructure of the PLMN.\n2.4.1\tExplicit IMSI detach/attach\nExplicit IMSI detach operation is the action taken by an MS to indicate to the PLMN that the station has entered an inactive state (e.g. the station is powered down). Explicit IMSI attach operation is the action taken by an MS to indicate that the station has re-entered an active state (e.g. the station is powered up).\n2.4.2\tImplicit IMSI detach\n\nImplicit IMSI detach operation is the action taken by the VLR to mark an MS as detached when there has been no successful contact between the MS and the network for a time determined by the implicit detach timer. The value of the implicit detach timer is derived from the periodic location updating timer; when the MSC/VLR applies Mobility Management Congestion Control to a MS, the MSC/VLR may need to adjust the Implicit Detach timer as specified in clause 3.7.2. During an established radio contact, the implicit detach timer shall be prevented from triggering implicit detach. At the release of the radio connection, the implicit detach timer shall be reset and restarted. Implicit IMSI detach shall also be performed in the case of a negative response to an IMEI check.\n2.5\tUse of the term mobile station (MS) in the present document\n\nIn order to simplify the text the term Mobile Station (MS) as used in relation to location management refers to the entity where the IMSI is stored, i.e., in card operated MSs the term Mobile Station (MS) refers to the card.\n2.6\tPaging area\nAs an option, and for paging optimization purpose, the VLR may control Paging Areas. A Paging Area (PgA) is composed of up to 5 Location Areas, and the MSC area is composed of several Paging Areas. Paging areas may overlap each other. The Paging Area is stored in the HLR and updated at each paging area change. The Paging Area is sent by the HLR to the VLR at roaming number request and may be used by the MSC/VLR for paging (e.g. when LAI is not known, after MSC/VLR restart) (see 3GPP TS 23.018 [5a]).",

In contrast to LTE, OFDM can also be used in the NR uplink (UL) direction. As a complement waveform with lower peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) to improve UL coverage, DFT-s-OFDM (OFDM with Discrete Fourier Transform precoding) can be used in the uplink although limited to single-layer transmission only.\n\nTo cope with various deployment scenarios, NR supports a wide range of carrier frequencies (within two possible ranges) and channel bandwidths, as shown in the table below.\n\nTo allow for such a flexibility, NR uses a flexible frame structure, with different Subcarrier Spacings (SCS). The SCS is the distance between the centres of two consecutive subcarriers, and the possible values for SCS are (in kHz): 15; 30; 60; 120 and 240. This is referred to as \"multiple numerologies\".\n\nA consecutive series of 12 subcarriers forms one Resource Block (RB). An NR channel bandwidth consists of a number of RBs. A Resource Element (RE) is defined as a unit of one subcarrier (frequency domain) and one OFDM symbol (time domain).\n\nAs for the time domain, it is divided in 10ms radio frames, each on consisting in 10 subframes of 1ms each, as shown in the picture below.\n\nIn turn, each subframe consists of 1/2/4/8/16 slots -shown in different colors- depending on the selected SCS/numerology.  The figure shows the cases of SCS values of 15; 30; 60 and 120 KHz, while the table below provides the full list of possible numerologies in NR. As shown in the figure for the 15 kHz case, each slot consists of 14 OFDM symbols (independently of the SCS) preceded by a cyclic prefix (CP).\n\nNote that, for the 60 kHz SCS, an extended CP is possible. The extended CP is approximately four times longer than the normal CP and is used for cells having large delay spread. In this case, one slot consists of only 12 OFDM symbols.\n\nThe OFDM symbol duration and CP length are inversely proportional of the SCS. E.g. for 15 kHz SCS, the OFDM symbol duration is approximately 66.6 µs and the CP length is approximately 4.7 µs. When the SCS is doubled, i.e. 30 kHz, the OFDM and CP lengths are approximately devided by two compared to the 15kHz SCS.\n\nNR supports both FDD and TDD operation with the same frame structure. In the case of TDD, and as to allow for flexible traffic adaptation, each OFDM symbol in a slot can be classified as 'downlink', 'uplink' or 'flexible' (i.e. either downlink or uplink). This can be configured semi-statically or it can change dynamically as part of the scheduling decision.\n\nTransmissions are usually carried out over one slot. In specific cases, transmissions can be carried out over only a fraction of a slot, with the minimum set to only two symbols. Such very short transmissions mainly target usage cases requiring low latency, such as some URLLC (Ultra Reliable, Low Latency) services.",

This service component controls the transfer of the trace records from the NEFs to the OSF. The conceptual model is illustrated in figure 5, which employs both the event report function (CCITT X.734 [14]) and the log control function (CCITT X.735 [15]).\n\nThe trace control function collects traceable events within the NEF and formats them into trace records. These trace records may be stored locally within the NEF filestore or transferred to the OSF in the form of event reports. This is controlled by means of the \"priority\" indicator, which is a part of the trace type. If the \"priority\" indicator is not set then the trace records shall stored within the local filestore and subsequently transferred to the OSF in bulk via FTAM.\n\nIf a trace is activated with the \"priority\" indicator set then the trace records shall be sent to the OSF either direct by the trace control function or through Event Forwarding Discriminators (EFDs).\n\nIf EFDs are used then all trace records are offered to the EFDs. The EFDs determine which of the records are to be transmitted to the OSF in the form of event reports and the Operation System Id field in the header is ignored. The EDFs have complex filter constructs, which allow the operator to define the criteria for destinations and filters.\n\nIf EFDs are not used then all priority records are forwarded to the OSF whose address is given in the Operation System Id field. The NEF is required to supply additional information to provide the OS management application entity title.\n\nFinally, the trace records may also be stored in the form of log entries within the log of the NEF. It is up to the operator to decide if the log function is needed in parallel with the event reporting and file store. Once stored, the log records may be individually accessed by the OSF via the appropriate object management functions. Care should be taken of filter criteria for log records to avoid unnecessary overheads.\n\nThis service component contains the following groups of TMN management functions:\n\n9.2\tTransfer of Records\n\n9.2.1\tBulk record transfer\n\nThis group of TMN functions is concerned with the bulk transfer of trace records from the NEF record filestore to the OSF.\n\nThe trace records shall be transferred from the NEF to the OSF by the use of FTAM services. For further details of the use of FTAM see GSM 12.01 [8].\n\nIn addition to the simple file transfer services provided by FTAM, peertopeer application process communication may also be supported. The use of CMIS services for the uploading of files from the NEF to the OSF is specified in the GSM 12.00 [7].\n\nWhen the procedure defined in GSM 12.00 [7] and GSM 12.01 [8] are used to transfer the trace records, the file type shall be traceRecords and the format of the file is given by the type TraceFileFormat.\n\n9.2.2\tLog control\n\nThis function permits the trace record to be stored and retrieved from logs within the NEF. The logging of these records is performed in accordance with the log control function specified in CCITT X.735 [15] and no additional management functions are required.\n\n9.2.3\tLog access\n\nThis TMN function controls the access to the log described above. Each log defined may contain one or more log entries. Each log entry contains a single trace record.\n\nFor further details concerning the use of logs, see CCITT X.735 [15].\n\nThe following system management functions are required:\n\n9.2.4\tEvent Reporting\n\n9.2.4.1\tEvent Forwarding Discriminators\n\nFor shortterm recording of tracing events and for more complicated filter conditions the event forwarding discriminator construct defined in CCITT X.734 [14] and CCITT X.721 [13] can be employed. The event forwarding discriminator construct is extremely flexible permitting the combination of a number of fields and logical operations with a wide variety of scheduling options. The EFD also controls the destinations to which the event reports are sent. Several such filters may be defined and scheduled for operation at different times and for different time periods.\n\nThe following system management functions are required:\n\n9.2.4.2\tDirect Transfer by Trace Control Function\n\nThis function permits the NEF to transmit trace records direct to the OSF. In general the trace record shall be sent on completion of the call or the traceable event. This function is controlled by means of the \"priority\" indicator, which is contained in the trace type. If the priority indicator is not set, then the trace records shall be stored on file within the NE filestore. These records may be subsequently collected via bulk record transfer as described in subclause 9.2.1. If the trace type specified on activation includes the \"priority\" indicator then all of the records shall be sent via trace reports to the OSF specified by the operation system id.\n\nThe following system management functions are required:",

Release 8 was frozen in December 2008 and this has been the basis for the first wave of LTE equipment. LTE specifications are very stable, with the added benefit of enhancements having been introduced in all subsequent 3GPP Releases.\n\nLTE (Long Term Evolution) or the E-UTRAN (Evolved Universal Terrestrial Access Network), introduced in 3GPP R8, is the access part of the Evolved Packet System (EPS). The main requirements for the new access network are high spectral efficiency, high peak data rates, short round trip time as well as flexibility in frequency and bandwidth.\n\nGSM was developed to carry real time services, in a circuit switched manner (blue in figure 1), with data services only possible over a circuit switched modem connection, with very low data rates. The first step towards an IP based packet switched (green in figure 1) solution was taken with the evolution of GSM to GPRS, using the same air interface and access method, TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access).\nTo reach higher data rates in UMTS (Universal Mobile Terrestrial System) a new access technology WCDMA (Wideband Code Division Multiple Access) was developed. The access network in UMTS emulates a circuit switched connection for real time services and a packet switched connection for datacom services (black in figure 1). In UMTS the IP address is allocated to the UE when a datacom service is established and released when the service is released. Incoming datacom services are therefore still relying upon the circuit switched core for paging.\nThe Evolved Packet System (EPS) is purely IP based. Both real time services and datacom services will be carried by the IP protocol. The IP address is allocated when the mobile is switched on and released when switched off.\n The new access solution, LTE, is based on OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access) and in combination with higher order modulation (up to 64QAM), large bandwidths (up to 20 MHz) and spatial multiplexing in the downlink (up to 4x4) high data rates can be achieved. The highest theoretical peak data rate on the transport channel is 75 Mbpsin the uplink, and in the downlink, using spatial multiplexing, the rate can be as high as 300 Mbps. \nThe LTE access network is simply a network of base stations, evolved NodeB (eNB), generating a flat architecture (figure 2). There is no centralized intelligent controller, and the eNBs are normally inter-connected viathe X2-interface and towards the core network by the S1-interface (figure 2). The reason for distributing the intelligence amongst the base-stations in LTE is to speed up the connection set-up and reduce the time required for a handover. For an end-user the connection set-up time for a real time data session is in many cases crucial, especially in on-line gaming. The time for a handover is essential for real-time services where end-users tend to end calls if the handover takes too long.\n\nAnother advantage with the distributed solution is that the MAC protocol layer, which is responsible for scheduling, is represented only in the UE and in the base station leading to fast communication and decisions between the eNB and the UE. In UMTS the MAC protocol, and scheduling, is located in the controller and when HSDPA was introduced an additional MAC sub-layer, responsible for HSPA scheduling was added in the NB.\nThe scheduler is a key component for the achievement of a fast adjusted and efficiently utilized radio resource. The Transmission Time Interval (TTI) is set to only 1 ms.\nDuring each TTI the eNB scheduler shall:\n\n- consider the physical radio environment per UE. The UEs report their perceived radio quality, as an input to the scheduler to decide which Modulation and Coding scheme to use. The solution relies on rapid adaptation to channel variations, employing HARQ (Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request) with soft-combining and rate adaptation.\n- prioritize the QoS service requirements amongst the UEs. LTE supports both delay sensitive real-time services as well as datacom services requiring high data peak rates. \n- inform the UEs of allocated radio resources. The eNB schedules the UEs both on the downlink and on the uplink. For each UE scheduled in a TTI the user data will be carried in a Transport Block (TB). DL there can be a maximum of two TBs generated per TTI per UE - if spatial multiplexing is used. The TB is delivered on a transport channel. In LTE the number of channels is decreased compare to UMTS. For the user plane there isonly one shared transport channel in each direction. The TB sent on the channel, can therefore contain bits from a number of services, multiplexed together.\n\nTo achieve high radio spectral efficiency as well as enable efficient scheduling in both time and frequency domain, a multicarrier approach for multiple access was chosen by 3GPP. For the downlink, OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access) was selected and for the uplink SC-FDMA (Single Carrier - Frequency Division Multiple Access) also known as DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform) spread OFDMA (figure 3).\n\nOFDM is a multicarrier technology subdividing the available bandwidth into a multitude of mutual orthogonal narrowband subcarriers. In OFDMA these subcarriers can be shared between multiple users. The OFDMA solution leads to high Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) requiring expensive power amplifiers with high requirements on linearity, increasing the power consumption for the sender. This is no problem in the eNB, but would lead to very expensive handsets. Hence a different solution was selected for the UL. As illustrated in figure 3, the SC-FDMA solution generates a signal with single carrier characteristics, hence with a low PAPR.\nTo enable possible deployment around the world, supporting as many regulatory requirements as possible, LTE is developed for a number of frequency bands - E-UTRA operating bands- currently ranging from 700 MHz up to 2.7GHz. The available bandwidths are also flexible starting with 1.4 MHz up to 20 MHz. LTE is developed to support both the time division duplex technology (TDD) as well as frequency division duplex (FDD). In R8 there are 15 bands specified for FDD and eight bands for TTD. In R9 four bands were added for FDD. Also added in R9 were for example Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service (MBMS), and Home eNB (HeNB), see figure 4. MBMS is used to provide broadcast information to all users, for example advertisement, and multicast to a closed group subscribing to a specific service, e.g. streaming TV. HeNBs are introduced mainly to provide coverage indoors, in homes or offices.The HeNB is a low power eNB that will be used in small cells - femto cells. Normally it will be owned by the customer, deployed without any network planning and connected to the operators EPC (Evolved Packet Core).\n\n- TS 36.211 Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA); Physical channels and modulation\n- TS 36.212 Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA); Multiplexing and channel coding\n- TS 36.213 Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA); Physical layer procedures\n- TS 36.300 Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA) and Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN); Overall description; Stage 2\n- TS 36.321 Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA); Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol specification\n- TS 36.331 Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA); Radio Resource Control (RRC); Protocol specification\n- TS 36.413 Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN); S1 Application Protocol (S1AP)\n- TS 36.423 Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN); X2 Application Protocol (X2AP)\n\nThe technical paper UTRA-UTRAN Long Term Evolution (LTE) and 3GPP System Architecture Evolution (SAE) is a good starting point.\n\nInitiated in 2004, the Long Term Evolution (LTE) project focused on enhancing the Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (UTRA) and optimizing 3GPP's radio access architecture.\n\nThe 3GPP 36 series of specifications, covers the \"Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA)\".\n\nSee also - the technologies page on LTE-Advanced, which describes the work beyond LTE Release 8/9.",

In contrast to LTE, OFDM can also be used in the NR uplink (UL) direction. As a complement waveform with lower peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) to improve UL coverage, DFT-s-OFDM (OFDM with Discrete Fourier Transform precoding) can be used in the uplink although limited to single-layer transmission only.\n\nTo cope with various deployment scenarios, NR supports a wide range of carrier frequencies (within two possible ranges) and channel bandwidths, as shown in the table below.\n\nTo allow for such a flexibility, NR uses a flexible frame structure, with different Subcarrier Spacings (SCS). The SCS is the distance between the centres of two consecutive subcarriers, and the possible values for SCS are (in kHz): 15; 30; 60; 120 and 240. This is referred to as \"multiple numerologies\".\n\nA consecutive series of 12 subcarriers forms one Resource Block (RB). An NR channel bandwidth consists of a number of RBs. A Resource Element (RE) is defined as a unit of one subcarrier (frequency domain) and one OFDM symbol (time domain).\n\nAs for the time domain, it is divided in 10ms radio frames, each on consisting in 10 subframes of 1ms each, as shown in the picture below.\n\nIn turn, each subframe consists of 1/2/4/8/16 slots -shown in different colors- depending on the selected SCS/numerology.  The figure shows the cases of SCS values of 15; 30; 60 and 120 KHz, while the table below provides the full list of possible numerologies in NR. As shown in the figure for the 15 kHz case, each slot consists of 14 OFDM symbols (independently of the SCS) preceded by a cyclic prefix (CP).\n\nNote that, for the 60 kHz SCS, an extended CP is possible. The extended CP is approximately four times longer than the normal CP and is used for cells having large delay spread. In this case, one slot consists of only 12 OFDM symbols.\n\nThe OFDM symbol duration and CP length are inversely proportional of the SCS. E.g. for 15 kHz SCS, the OFDM symbol duration is approximately 66.6 µs and the CP length is approximately 4.7 µs. When the SCS is doubled, i.e. 30 kHz, the OFDM and CP lengths are approximately devided by two compared to the 15kHz SCS.\n\nNR supports both FDD and TDD operation with the same frame structure. In the case of TDD, and as to allow for flexible traffic adaptation, each OFDM symbol in a slot can be classified as 'downlink', 'uplink' or 'flexible' (i.e. either downlink or uplink). This can be configured semi-statically or it can change dynamically as part of the scheduling decision.\n\nTransmissions are usually carried out over one slot. In specific cases, transmissions can be carried out over only a fraction of a slot, with the minimum set to only two symbols. Such very short transmissions mainly target usage cases requiring low latency, such as some URLLC (Ultra Reliable, Low Latency) services.",

It is assumed that selection of a candidate UE/MS has already taken place within the BSC based upon the criteria presented in clause 5. The exact algorithm, in the BSC, for determining a candidate UE/MS is not addressed in the present document. The procedures discussed do not make use of the Mobile Application Part (MAP), represented by signalling function 4 in figures 4 and 6. The procedure described in this clause covers case ii).\nIn case of subsequent handover the following applies. If 3G_MSC-B supports location reporting at change of Service Area and if encapsulated BSSAP signalling is used on the E-interface, 3G_MSC-B shall always initiate the Location Reporting Control procedure at change of Service Area towards the target RNS since no request for Location Reporting can be received from MSC-A. In that case, the Location Reporting Control procedure shall be initiated by 3G_MSC-B after the Relocation Resource Allocation procedure has been executed successfully.\n\nThe change of Service Area shall be reported to MSC-A within an A-HANDOVER-PERFORMED message.\nIn the case of ongoing voice group calls, the handover does not take place since voice group calls are not supported in UMTS.\nThe successful operation of the procedure is as follows. When the BSS (BSS-A), currently supporting the UE, determines that the UE requires to be handed over to UMTS it will send an AHANDOVER-REQUIRED message to the 3G_MSC (3G_MSCA). The A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message shall contain a single cell, to which the UE can be handed over. When the 3G_MSCA receives the A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message it shall begin the process of handing over the UE to a new RNS (RNS-B). The 3G_MSCA shall generate an Iu-RELOCATION-REQUEST message to the selected RNS (RNS-B). For handover of a speech call to UTRAN Iu mode, 3G_MSC-A shall include a NAS Synch Indicator in the Iu-RELOCATION-REQUEST message.\n\nIf 3G_MSC-A supports inter-system handover to a CSG cell and BSS-A includes a CSG ID for the target cell in the A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message, then 3G_MSC-A shall check the CSG membership of the UE for the target cell as described in subclause 4.3.1 before generating the Iu-RELOCATION-REQUEST message. If the UE fails the CSG membership check and the target cell is a CSG cell, 3G_MSC-A shall send an A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED-REJECT to BSS-A.\nWhen RNS-B receives the Iu-RELOCATION-REQUEST message it shall take the necessary action to allow the UE to access the radio resource of RNS-B, this is detailed in the 3GPP TS 25.300 series and the 3GPP TS 25.200 series of 3GPP Technical Specifications. The switching of the radio resource through the necessary terrestrial resources is detailed in the 3GPP TS 25.430 series and 3GPP TS 25.413.\n\nOnce resource allocation has been completed by RNS-B, it shall return an Iu-RELOCATION-REQUEST-ACK. to 3G_MSCA. When this message is received by 3G_MSCA it shall begin the process of instructing the UE to tune to a new dedicated radio resource. An A-HANDOVER-COMMAND will be sent by the 3G_MSCA to BSS-A. On receipt of the A-HANDOVER-COMMAND message BSS-A will send the radio interface message RI-HANDOVER-COMMAND. The UE will then access the new radio resource. On detection of the UE, the RNS-B shall send an Iu-RELOCATION-DETECT to 3G_MSCA. When the UE is successfully communicating with the RNS-B an RRC-HANDOVER-COMPLETE message will be sent by the UE to RNS-B. The RNS-B will then send an Iu-RELOCATION-COMPLETE message to 3G_MSCA.\nAfter 3G_MSCA has received the Iu-RELOCATION-COMPLETE message from RNS-B, it shall begin to release the resources allocated on BSS-A. In figure 9 the resource is released by using the ACLEAR-COMMAND sequence.\n\nIf a failure occurs during the handover attempt, for example, A-HANDOVER-FAILURE returned from BSS-A or IuRELOCATION FAILURE returned from RNS-B, then 3G_MSCA will terminate the handover to RNS-B. Under these conditions 3G_MSCA may optionally take one of a number of actions:\nThe exact action taken is dependent on whether the failure occurs before or after the A-HANDOVER-COMMAND has been sent.\nIn all cases the existing connection to the UE shall not be cleared except in the case of expiry of the timer for receipt of Iu-RELOCATION-COMPLETE.\nDuring the period that the UE is not in communication with the network 3G_MSCA shall queue all appropriate messages. All messages shall be delivered to the UE once communication is resumed. In the case of an Intra-3G_MSC GSM to UMTS handover on 3G_MSCB then the messages shall be queued by 3G_MSCB.",

    "context": "https://www.sharetechnote.com/html/Handbook_LTE_LTEU_LTER.html\n\nLTE Adv: LAA/LTE-U\n\nRecently (from 2014 as far as I remember), there has been pretty much discussion (even real testing going on) on LTE being extended to non-standard mode of operation (Non 3GPP yet at least up to this point, as of Jan 2015).\n\nNote : In early second half of 2016, I saw a company to try LTE-U device for the first timie, and as it approaches to the end of the year, I saw many companies testing LTE-U devices. Now in early 2017 we are at the stage of testing LAA.\n\nTwo of the technology falling into this category is LTE-U and LTE-R. LTE-U has been proposed and start being implemented in the industry for about a year and LTE-R just start being proposed as Integrated wireless railway network to be commercialized .\n\nAs of Jun 2016, I don't see/hear anything about LTE-R.. but I saw the drastic evolution of unlicensed LTE that created several different technologies (names) to the list. It started with LTE-U and evolved to LAA, eLAA and recently we are hearing of new branches like MulteFire and LWA. I don't know how many other technologies are waiting to be newly evolved and which of these technologies\nwill survive to the end.. some of them are now pretty well defined but there are a lot of other features to be defined technically. I will keep following them up and try to write down whatever has been clarified.\n\nFollowings are the brief descriptions for each of these technologies. I will put further details under separate section if more technical details are published. Also, I put many whitepapers and YouTube links under Reference section. I would recommend you to go through those materials when you have free time and use this page as reminder afterwards. (The contents of this table\nis mostly based on Ref [7] )\n\nFollowings are the list of topics that gives you further details of various LTE-Unlicensed technologies.\n\nIn every wireless communication, the communicating parties (transmitter and reciever) need to allocatie a certain amount of resources in both time domain and frequency domain. However, we don't have much control over frequency domain resource allocation because those resources are fixed permanently or semi-statically. So it is usually not in the scope of scheduling. When it comes to scheduling, Time Domain resource allocation tend to be more important.\n\nIn 3GPP based technology (i.e, Cellular Communication Technology like LTE), the time domain scheduling is obvious and determinstic even when there are many devices are in communication because all of the time domain resources determined by the central master (Base Station /Node B/eNode B). However, in 802.11 based technology(i.e LAN, Wireless LAN etc) there is no central controling master in terms of scheduling. In this case, there is always possibility that transmission signal from one device interfere with communication of other devices. To prevent (or at least reduce) this situation, we need a special algorithm for Time Domain Scheduling. Time Domain Scheduling in this case mean 'Determine when to transmit and how long it transmit'.\n\nThen why we need to care of this kind of thing in LTE-Unlicensed technology ? Basically LTE Unlicensed technology (e.g, LTE-U, LAA etc) refer to a technology in which LTE operates in 802.11 frequency region. So LTE need to keep the rule set by 802.11 in order not to prevent the communiction between existing 802.11 devices.\n\nThere are many variations of the time domain scheduling, but the basic idea and logic is same. Basic idea is 'Your transmission should not interfere with communication between others' and the basic logic is 'Before you transmit anything, check if the chennel(medium) is already being used by others'. This logic can be illustrated as follows.\n\nThen you may have some questions as follows : How to check (i.e, how to figure out) whether the channel (medium) is being used by other ? and how long the device need to check before it make any decision ?\n\nIn the effort to answer these questions, you will come across many terms that may confuse you for so long. I tried to list up those confusing words and how these are related to each other in following illustration. If you are new to this area, I would suggest you to understand 'what is CS and ED ?' first and then try to understand how CS / ED is used in higher level technology like CSMA/CD, CSMA/CA, CCS, LBT, CSAT etc. Already feel headache ? :)\n\nCS / ED : CS stands for Carrier Sensing and ED stands for Energy Detection. The fundamental concept is same. The term CS is more frequently used in 802.11 area especially for Wired LAN Area. In this technology, the device measures the energy level in the channel (medium) mostly in the form of voltage and compares the measured voltage with a specified value (threshold value). ED stands for Energy Detection. it is more frequently used in wireless/cellular technology. In this method, the device measures the energy level in the channel (medium) mostly in the form of Power and compares the measured power with a specified value (threshold value)\n\nCSMA/CD or CSMA/CA : As the term CSMA(Carrier Sensing Multiple Access) implies, these are technology of figuring out whether a channel is available or not based on CS method. You don't need to know the details of thechnology under the context of LTE-Unlicensed technology, but if you are really interested in thses method refer to CSMA/CD and CSMA/CA page.\n\nCCA : CCA stands for Clear Channel Assessment. As the word implies, this is a method to figure out the channel is clear (i.e, nobody is using the channel). CCA perform ED(Energy Detection) for a certain period of time and make a decision whether the channel is clear or not. It is a common method being used in 802.11 (WLAN) technology.\n\nHow long CCA perform ED before it make decision ? It depends on higher layer technology (e.g, 802.11 FHSS, 802.11 OFDM, LBT). However, the minimum time span is 18 us sec.\n\nWhat is the threshold energy level to make decision whether the channel is being used by some other device or not ? This also varies depending on power class of the device and reciever antenna gain. However, the base threshold is -70 dBm.\n\nNOTE : Refer to 802.11 specification and ETSI EN 300 328 if you want to get full details and requirement for CCA.\n\nLBT: LBT stands for Listen Before Talk. According to ETSI EN 300 328, LBT is defined as 'mechanism by which an equipment applies clear channel assessment (CCA) before using the channel' (In this document, you can find a couple of variations of LBT depending on different situations). As you see in the terminology itself, 'Listen Before Talk' indicate two major process, the first one is 'Listen' and the second part is 'Talk'. The meaning of 'Talk' is obvious. It means 'Transmit Data'. The tricky part is 'what does it exactly mean by 'Listen''. In more technical definition, 'Listen' mean 'perform CCA(Clear Channel Assessment)'. You can find a more detailed description on LBT in IEEE P802.19-08/0034r0 (The specific value (i.e, transmission time, threshold value may vary depending on application, but I think this explains overal LBT mechanism in easier way than other documents).\n\nCSAT : CSAT stands for Carrier Sensing Adaptive Transmission. CSAT is very similar to CSMA or LBT(Listen Before Talk), the main difference is that CSAT monitors(senses) the medium for much longer duration (around tens of msec to 200 msec) comparing to normal WiFi CSMA, so that it would not interfere not only with WiFi\ndata transmission (QoS traffic) but also with more sporadic transmission like discovery signals (Ref [2]). Unlike other techiques described in this section (defined with focus on 802.11 technology), CSAT is defined by LTE-U Forum with focus on 3GPP technology.\n\nIn LTE, every transmission within a specified spectrum is well managed/scheduled both for downlink and uplink. So Network can figure out exactly when to transmit something and when UE will transmit something.. but in Unlicensed band transmission and reception by the existing WiFi device is not as predictable as in LTE. Basically anybody can transmit in anytime as long as it complies with\nCSMA/CA procedure.\n\nIn this kind of situation, how LTE network can schedule transmission in Unlicensed band ?\n\nOne method is for LTE cell to perform a special channel selection procedure and allocate the channel only when it is clean. \nIn channel selection process, network measures the energy level within the allowed band and use those area in which the energy level is under a certain threshold (e.g, -62 dBm over 20 Mhz BW).\n\nThe Cell performs this kind of channel selection algorithm in on-going mode and if needed it will select more suitable channel and switch to it.\n\nWhat if you (a Cell) fail to find any clean channel at the initial channel selection process ?\n\nIn this case, the cell use another mechanism called CSAT (Carrier-Sensing Adaptive Transmission). Technically, CSAT is very similar to CSMA or LBT(Listen Before Talk), the main difference is that CSAT monitors(senses) the medium for much longer duration (around tens of msec to 200 msec) comparing to normal WiFi CSMA, so that it would not interfere not only with WiFi\ndata transmission (QoS traffic) but also with more sporadic transmission like discovery signals (Ref [2]).\n\nAccording to Reference [5], there seems to be roughly three levels of Coexistence strategy regarding LTE-U. Most of these techniques are already mentioned in previous section, but let me rewrite in a little bit different words.\n\nChannel Selection : This says \"Use WiFi band only when it is not being used (i.e, the band is clean)\". To figure out whether it is being used or not, you have to measure the engergy level of the target band as described above.\n\nTime-domain coexistence techniques : Even when it fail to find any clean channel in channel selection stage, there is still some chance. Even though there is no clean channel at the point of channel selection, there might be some empty slots if you look at the time domain scheduling with relatively high granularity.\nTo find out this kind of time domain opportunity and in order not to make an interference at any time, they are considering several different technology like CSAT, eCSAT, LBT. My personal question were 'do we have to support all these technology everywhere (every devices)?'. This question was answered by Reference [5] as follows.\n\nFor non listen-before-talk (LBT) markets such as the US, South Korea, China and India, CSAT (Carrier Sensing Adaptive Transmission) can be used without changing Rel-10 Carrier Aggregation protocols for co-channel coexistence. For LBT markets such as Europe and Japan, Rel-13 LAA will enable channel sharing with Wi-Fi by performing clear channel assessment (CCA) based channel availability sensing and adapting the transmission duration on a fine timescale, ranging from 1ms-10ms\n\nOpportunistic SCell operation : To me, this sounds like a rule (not a technology). Basically this says \"Use the unlicensed band only when it is really necessary (e.g, in real demand on high throughput or when the primary cell is overloaded). Release the unlicensenced and fall back to anchor carrier when\nthe demand for unlicenced band is not critical.\n\nInterplay of these coexistance technical components are well illustrated as follows in Ref [2].\n\nLTE-U stands for LTE-Unlicensed. This is the first real implementation of the whole LTE-Unlicensed family as far as I remember. Since this is already implemented and tested relatively widely and a lot of details are known, I thought I got enough information to write this subject in a separate page. Refer to LTE-U page for the details.\n\nIn other LTE-Unlincensed technology, LTE borrow only radio spectrum from WLAN and all the transmission/reception technology except radio spectrum purely based on LTE. However, in LWA LTE borrows not only WLAN radio spectrum but also WLAN Access Point for transmitting data. This key difference is illustrated as below. To implement this key difference, we would need to implement many other\ntechnical components. The most important part would be to implmenet special interface between LTE eNB and WLAN AP. Then you may ask.. at which layer the eNB and WLAN will be connected ? It would be quicker to interact if they can get connected at lower layer (e.g, PHY/MAC), but LTE PHY/MAC and WLAN PHY/MAC is completely different.. so hard to make any connection at this layer. So they will use higher layer (specifically PDCP) for this connection. As you know, there is no PDCP layer in WLAN. So connecting at PDCP\nlayer might be a little bit misleading. More accruately speaking, LTE PDCP packet will be encapsulated into WLAN MAC frame.\n\nNow LWA is defined in 3GPP specification and I created a separate page for 3GPP LWA because it will be a long story. Refer to LWA page for the 3GPP details.\n\nAround the end of 2016, I start hearing of implementing this both on UE modem and Network, UE testing equipment side. Now (as of early 2017) I am hearing of testing this feature on real UE. So I decided to create separate page for this. Read LAA page for the details.\n\nPutting very simple way, Multipath Aggregation (more formally Multipath TCP Aggregation : mptcp) is LTE-WLAN aggregation at TCP level as illustrated below. The key component in this architecture would be MP Proxy (Multipath Proxy) and this part is being defined in IETF (Ref [12] )\n\nAs of now (Jan 2015), I don't have any specific information other than Integrated wireless railway network to be commercialized .\n\n[1] LTE-U/LAA, MuLTEfire and Wi-Fi; making best use of unlicensed spectrum (Qualcomm)\n\n[9] Cracking Google Project Fi & LTE/Wi-Fi Aggregation with Qualcomm - Wi-Fi Now Episode 5 (YouTube)\n\n[10] The LTE-U vs. Wi-Fi debate continues empowering carriers with seamless Wi-Fi - Wi-Fi Now Episode 15 (YouYube)\n\n[15] ETSI EN 300 328 Wideband transmission systems;Data transmission equipment operating in the 2,4 GHz ISM band and using wide band modulation techniques;",

In session based charging, at least two chargeable events are needed, one each to describe the start and the end of the session, respectively. Multiple interim events are possible in order to describe changes to session characteristics (generally termed \"change of charging condition\", e.g. tariff time switch, change of PDP context QoS or change of IMS session media types), or when certain limits, e.g. time or volume, are exceeded. The CTF transforms each chargeable event into a charging event and forwards these charging events to the CDF in real-time.\n\nThe relation between chargeable events and charging events is 1:1. For event based charging, the relation between charging events and CDRs is 1:1. For session based charging, the relation between charging events and CDRs is m:n with m >=n.

Details, including if and when those events are generated, are specified in the middle tier TSs.\n\nDetails on the protocol application for the open Rf interface, including the message types and the domain / subsystem /service independent contents of the messages, can be found in TS 32.299 [50].",

The main differences to the procedures described in subclause 8.3.1 relate to the establishment of circuits between the network entities and the Handover Number allocation.\nIn the case of basic relocation, 3G_MSCA shall specify to 3G_MSCB that no Handover Number is required in the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request (see 3GPP TS 29.002).

At most possible occasions for paging, no message arrives for the UE and the power the UE consumed could have been saved. This feature allows the eNB to send the UE a 'wake-up signal' (WUS) to instruct the UE that it has to monitor NPDCCH for paging, and otherwise allows the UE to skip the paging procedures. This allows the UE to potentially keep parts of its hardware switched off for more of the time, and save the power of decoding NPDCCH and NPDSCH for paging. Depending on how long the network allows for the UE to 'wake up' after receiving a WUS, the UE may be able to keep switched on only a receiver dedicated to WUS detection, allowing much of the UE's conventional hardware to remain in a very low-power state.\n\nScheduling request (FDD)\n\nIn Rel-13/14 NB-IoT, scheduling request (SR) exists only as a higher-layer procedure, which triggers a random access procedure to request sufficient UL resource to send a buffer status report (BSR). Rel-15 has added new, more resource and power efficient, ways to achieve this goal which can be configured by the eNB.\n\nFor a connected mode UE, eNB is able to configure by RRC periodic NPUSCH resources for the UE to send BSR, so the eNB is informed when pending traffic has arrived in the UE's buffer. The resources are activated and de-activated ('released') by dynamic signalling on NPDCCH.\n\nA connected mode UE is able to send, in the physical layer, a request to the eNB to be granted NPUSCH resources to send a BSR. This can be done either by a dedicated signal using a pre-configured NPRACH transmission, or via 'piggybacking' the request onto HARQ ACK or NACK transmission from the UE if one is available, by applying a cover code to the ACK or NACK symbols.\n\nEarly data transmission (FDD)\n\nAn idle mode UE is able to transmit data in Msg3 of the random access procedure, carrying between 328 and 1000 bits. After successful reception by eNB, the random access procedure terminates and the UE does not transition to connected mode. The UE requests a grant for EDT if its pending data is smaller than a maximum permitted size configured by eNB, by using a pre-configured set of NPRACH resources for its preamble transmission. The eNB can allow the UE to transmit a smaller amount of data than the maximum permitted size, in order to reduce the power spent transmitting padding bits.\n\nQuick release of RRC connection (FDD and TDD)\n\nA NB-IoT UE has to wait up to 10 seconds, after the receipt of the RRCConnectionRelease message, in case lower layers do not indicate successful acknowledgement of the reception. This feature allows that, in case the UE is not polled, the UE can consider the receipt of the RRCConnectionRelease message to be successfully acknowledged as soon as the UE has sent HARQ ACK. This feature was introduced from the Rel-14 specifications.\n\nRelaxed monitoring for cell reselection (FDD and TDD)\n\nThis feature allows much of the RRM monitoring to be avoided in cases where an NB-IoT UE is stationary and/or the network topology is not changing, and UE battery life can be correspondingly extended. The network configures the UE with a 'NRSRP delta' threshold, and while the change in RSRP its current cell is less than the threshold, the UE does not need to monitor neighbouring cells for 24 hours. This feature was introduced from the Rel-14 specifications.\n\nRLC UM (FDD and TDD)\n\nRel-15 adds support for RLC unacknowledged mode (UM) to complement the acknowledged mode (AM) and transparent mode (TM) introduced in Rel-13. This reduces the need to send RLC signalling over the air for IoT traffic which may be latency and/or loss tolerant, or recoverable by the application layer.\n\nNarrowband measurement accuracy improvement (FDD)\n\nThe narrowband secondary synchronization signal (NSSS) or, on the serving cell, transmissions of MIB-NB on the narrowband physical broadcast channel (NPBCH) can be used for making NRSRP measurements, as alternatives to using narrowband reference signals (NRS). NSSS and NPBCH use more resource elements for their transmission than NRS, and this should reduce the amount of subframes the UE needs to process to achieve a given measurement accuracy.\n\nNPRACH range enhancement (FDD)\n\nNB-IoT is sometimes deployed in cells with radius of up to around 100 km. Rel-13 NPRACH supports cell radii up to 40 km with unambiguous determination of UE range. Beyond that distance, because NPRACH is a pure sine wave transmission, there can be ambiguities for the eNB to determine the UE's range. A new NPRACH format is introduced with a subcarrier spacing of 1.25 kHz and a cyclic prefix of 800 μs, together with frequency hopping, which is sufficient to allow unambiguous range determination up to 120 km.\n\nSmall cell support (FDD and TDD)\n\neNB power classes are defined in NB-IoT to allow deployment of eNBs as microcells, picocells and femtocells, which use lower maximum transmit power than macro eNBs.\n\nReduced system acquisition time (FDD)\n\nIn FDD, when SIB1-NB is being transmitted with 16 repetitions (the maximum supported), eNB can transmit additional subframes containing SIB1-NB repetitions on anchor carriers and non-anchor carriers to allow faster decoding of SIB1-NB and reduce the UE's power consumption during cell access. Compared to Rel-13 which supports up to 8 SIB1-NB repetitions, Rel-15 allows 16 repetitions.\n\nUE differentiation (FDD and TDD)\n\nThe network is able to collect and store in the MME information about the UE and its traffic profile. This can be used to improve the scheduling of the UE according to e.g. its battery life or power supply, mobility, and when it tends to have traffic to transmit.\n\nAccess barring enhancement (FDD and TDD)\n\nIn Rel-13, the network can bar UEs at times of high load on a cell-specific basis. This feature allows UEs to be barred on a per-coverage level basis, so that UEs in deeper coverage levels and needing more repetitions of their transmissions, can be barred separately from other, less resource-intensive, UEs.\n\nMixed standalone operation (FDD)\n\nIn Rel-13, a standalone anchor or non-anchor NB-IoT carrier can only be configured together with another standalone carrier. This feature allows configuration of standalone anchor carriers with in-band and guard-band non-anchor carriers, and of in-band and guard-band anchor carriers with standalone non-anchor carriers. This allows small slices of non-LTE spectrum to be used as a standalone NB-IoT carrier and be linked with NB-IoT carriers associated to LTE spectrum.\n\nPower headroom reporting enhancement (FDD)\n\nIn Rel-13, power headroom reports (PHR) are made by the UE from one of two tables depending on coverage, each containing four entries. This feature improves the granularity of PHR transmitted in Msg3 to have 16 levels.\n\nTDD\n\nSupport for TDD is introduced, incorporating the Rel-13 NB-IoT feature together with Rel-14 features: UE category NB2, 2 UL/DL HARQ processes, multi-carrier RACH and paging, and OTDOA [1]. All LTE UL/DL subframe configurations are supported, except for configurations 0 and 6, and all LTE special subframe configurations are supported. In addition, some Rel-15 features described above are agnostic to FDD/TDD and thus can be used for both.",

For each DCI format, frequency-domain and time-domain resource allocation fields are included. For frequency-domain resource allocation, resource block group (RBG)-level bit-map resource allocation (resource allocation Type 0) and contiguous resource allocation (resource allocation Type1) are supported. A UE can be configured with either or both of them. For time-domain resource allocation, the time-domain resource allocation field in the DCI jointly indicates scheduled slot, starting symbol, and the duration (number of consecutive symbols to use for the channel).\n\nFor PUSCH and PDSCH, other than DCI-based scheduling, configured grant for PUSCH and semi-persistent scheduling (SPS) for PDSCH are supported. For configured grant PUSCH, once PUSCH resource is configured and activated, the UE can transmit a PUSCH without DCI format 0_0/0_1. There are two types of configured grant PUSCH; with the configured grant Type1, UE can transmit PUSCH on the configured grant resource once RRC configuration is available, while with the configured grant Type2, UE can transmit PUSCH on the configured grant resource after a DCI with CRC scrambled by CS-RNTI activates the configured grant resource. SPS for PDSCH also requires activation DCI with CRC scrambled by CS-RNTI.\n\nFor NR, only asynchronous and adaptive HARQ is supported for both PDSCH and PUSCH. A PDSCH or PUSCH can be re-transmitted at any timing and with any transmission configuration. For re-transmission of a PDSCH or PUSCH, DCI formats 0_0/0_1 or 1_0/1_1 is used.

Initial transmission/retransmission of a TB and soft-buffer store/flush are controlled per HARQ process number. Redundancy version is used to control redundancy of channel coded bits.\n\nUE reports HARQ-ACK feedback for a decoded PDSCH. UE can be configured with reporting one HARQ-ACK bit for each transport block (TB), while if a UE is configured with CBG-based PDSCH transmission, the UE reports one HARQ-ACK bit for each code block group (CBG).

The location information for each MS is stored in functional units called location registers. Functionally, there are two types of location registers:\nSee also 3GPP TS 23.002 where the network architecture is described, and 3GPP TS 23.008 where the data stored in the location registers are described.\nThe action taken by a MS in order to provide location information to the PLMN will be referred to as location updating.\n2.2\tLocation area and MSC area\nThe MSC area is composed of the area covered by all base stations controlled by the MSC. An MSC area may consist of several location areas. A location area is an area in which, after having performed a location update once, MSs may roam without being required to perform subsequent location updates for reason of location change. A location area consists of one or more cells.\n\nFor further details of the network architecture, see 3GPP TS 23.002.\n2.3\tLocation area identification\nThe Location Area Identification (LAI) plan is part of the base station identification plan. The base stations are identified uniquely (see 3GPP TS 23.003).\n2.4\tIMSI detach/attach operation\nThe support of IMSI detach/attach operation is mandatory in MSs. The facility is optional in the fixed infrastructure of the PLMN.\n2.4.1\tExplicit IMSI detach/attach\nExplicit IMSI detach operation is the action taken by an MS to indicate to the PLMN that the station has entered an inactive state (e.g. the station is powered down). Explicit IMSI attach operation is the action taken by an MS to indicate that the station has re-entered an active state (e.g. the station is powered up).\n2.4.2\tImplicit IMSI detach\n\nImplicit IMSI detach operation is the action taken by the VLR to mark an MS as detached when there has been no successful contact between the MS and the network for a time determined by the implicit detach timer. The value of the implicit detach timer is derived from the periodic location updating timer; when the MSC/VLR applies Mobility Management Congestion Control to a MS, the MSC/VLR may need to adjust the Implicit Detach timer as specified in clause 3.7.2. During an established radio contact, the implicit detach timer shall be prevented from triggering implicit detach. At the release of the radio connection, the implicit detach timer shall be reset and restarted. Implicit IMSI detach shall also be performed in the case of a negative response to an IMEI check.\n2.5\tUse of the term mobile station (MS) in the present document\n\nIn order to simplify the text the term Mobile Station (MS) as used in relation to location management refers to the entity where the IMSI is stored, i.e., in card operated MSs the term Mobile Station (MS) refers to the card.\n2.6\tPaging area\nAs an option, and for paging optimization purpose, the VLR may control Paging Areas. A Paging Area (PgA) is composed of up to 5 Location Areas, and the MSC area is composed of several Paging Areas. Paging areas may overlap each other. The Paging Area is stored in the HLR and updated at each paging area change. The Paging Area is sent by the HLR to the VLR at roaming number request and may be used by the MSC/VLR for paging (e.g. when LAI is not known, after MSC/VLR restart) (see 3GPP TS 23.018 [5a]).",

For example, there can be one network slice for IoT, another one for supporting \"classic\" UEs and another one for V2X. More generally, there can be different requirements on functionality (e.g., priority, policy control), differences in performance requirements (e.g., latency, mobility and data rates), or they can serve only specific types of users (e.g., MPS users, Public Safety users, corporate customers, roamers, or hosting an MVNO). The different slices can be used simultaneously.\n\nEnd-to-end Network slicing is a major characteristic of the 5G System. It is supported by every deployed PLMN to the extent necessary to interoperate with other PLMNs, e.g. the IoT slice from operator A can interconnect directly with the IoT slice of operator B. Based on business scenario, the operator can decide how many network slices to deploy and what functions/features to share across multiple slices.\n\nThe characteristics of each slice are defined in terms of QoS, bit rate, latency, etc. For a given slice, these characteristics are either predefined in the 3GPP Standard or are operator-defined. There are three types of predefined slices: type 1 is dedicated to the support of eMBB, type 2 is for URLLC and type 3 is for MIoT support. These predefinitions allow inter-PLMN operation with reduced coordination effort between operators. As for the operator-defined slices, they enable more differentiation among network slices.\n\nA dedicated NF is introduced for slices handling: the \"Network Slice Selection Function\" (NSSF), which enables the selection of the appropriate slice(s). The UEs may use multiple Network Slices simultaneously. The Network Slice Selection policies in the UE links applications to Network slices.\n\nNetwork slicing also supports roaming scenarios. Finally, Network Slicing Interworking with EPS (with or without 4G's Dedicated Core Networks Selection Mechanism (e)DECOR) is possible.",

    "context": "https://www.sharetechnote.com/html/BasicProcedure_LTE_MIMO.html\n\nComm. Tech.: MIMO\n\nI think everybody would know what MIMO is. Simply put, it is a technique to increase the data throughput by using multiple transmitter antenna and multiple reciever antenna.\n\nFollowing illustration is showing a very basic and over-simplified concept of MIMO. In very strict sense, it may be a little misleading but this can show the most common sense of MIMO concept.\n\nAs you see in the illustration, with MIMO mutiple independent data streams are transmitted simulteneously and as a result it can achieve much higher data throughput in comparison to SISO (Single Input Single Output) case. However, there is almost no advantage in terms of reliability of data transfer (e.g, less error) comparing to SISO case.\n\nThere is another concept which is often confused with MIMO. It is Diversity. What would be the difference between MIMO and Diversity ?\n\nFollowing illustration would show the concept of Diversity. There are basically two types of Diversity called Reciever Diversity and Transmitter Diversity.\n\nAs you see in the illustration, in this Diversity configuration Single copy of one bit stream is being transmitted and reaches to multiple reciever antenna via a little different path, it means the reciever can have multiple versions of same data. Out of the multiple version, the reciever can select the best one or combine them all together in such a way to improve data quality. By doing\nthis, communication reliability (less error) can be increased.. but no advantage in terms data throughput.\n\nHere goes another type of Diversity. In this Diversity configuration, Multiple copies of one(single) bit stream is being transmitted via multiple Tx antenna and reaches to single reciever antenna via a little different path, it means the reciever can have multiple versions of same data. Out of the multiple version, the reciever can select the best one or combine them all together\nin such a way to improve data quality. By doing this, communication reliability (less error) can be increased.. but no advantage in terms data throughput.\n\nSo.. overall concept is simple, but detailed process and implementation is not as simple as you may think. If you just want to get a common sense of MIMO. This would be enough.\n\nHowever, if you want to know very details of MIMO/Diversity especially about what's going on in physical layer, it would be almost impossible to understand the details of MIMO/Diversity concept without going through underlying mathmatics. Actually math itself is not that complicated but interpreting the math and translate the math into real implementation is difficult. I hope\nmy math section in this site would helpful on this. (Please see the Engineering Math - Matrix as you go along this section).\n\nHowever describing and explain the full details of MIMO math would be huge task and it would take several month.. meaning this page will get updated for a while.\n\nBefore jump into mathematical details, I want to summrize overall MIMO configurations that are most commonly accepted or discussed, and the PHY/MAC procedures that are used to implement each configuration. This is purely my personal classification. You may agree in terms of big picture, but may not agree in detailed level. The point is to show several keywords and key technologies related\nto MIMO.\n\nI don't think I can describe/explain all of these at mathematical level (at least in near future), I will be satisfied if I can successfully describe at least \"SU-MIMO with Open Loop\".\n\nIn case of 2 x 2, overall data transmission process can be illustrated as follows. The red arrow and four blocks (h11,h12,h21,h22) between the two antenna is to illustrate the possible data path between the two Tx and two Rx antenna.\n\nh11, h12,h21,h22 are special numbers (coefficient) to show how much of the data is going through each of the possible path. The greater the value is, the larger portions of data is being transmitted in that path. A matrix which is made up of these channel path coefficient is called \"Channel Information Matrix\". The reciever and transmitter relationship is represented as follows.\n\nAs I said the math itself is very simple. It would be like a first example at the first chapter of any linear algebra book. The important this is how to interpret this equation into real implementation. If I interpret it in an illustration, it would be as the path represented in green arrows. By this way, we can mathematically represent the recieved data (data distorted by the air path between\ntransmitter and reciever antenna), but just calculating the recieved is not our goal (not the function of the reciever). Our goal is to extract/figure out the 'transmitted data (original data)'. Mathematically this is also simple and it is represented in green arrows.\n\nAs you see in the process illustrated in green arrow, to recover the transmitted data (original data) from the received data we need to take inverse of the channel information matrix. Unfortunately there are a couple of issues with this method.\n\ni) Not all matrix is invertable. There are some matrix for which inverse matrix does not exists. (Please refer to here and see what kind of matrix is the one which is not invertable).\n\nii) Calculating the inverse matrix is not the simple process. So if there is some way to preprocess the data in such a way that UE can decode the data without doing inverse matrix calculation of the channel matrix.\n\nTo workaround these problems, we change the channel information matrix into three matrices by the method called SVD(Singular Value Decomposition). See the SVD page and clearly understand the meaning of this process. Probably my page would not be\nenough to give you full understanding about SVD. Google as much materials about this as possible and try to have some \"Intuitive\" understanding of the concept.\n\nWhen we apply any mathematical technique in engineering area, it should be meaningful in the engineering sense and should be implementable. The meaning and implementation of SVD can be illustrated as follows.\n\nThe important point is that by implementing this method, we can express the channel information matrix as a simple 'diagonal matrix'. That diagonal matrix is expressed as follows and can be illustrated as follows. Isn't it look simple and clear ? -:)\n\nNote : for more intuitive understandings on how SVD is used for precoding and equalization process, I posted another type of tutorial at www.slide4math.com Go go [Engineering]->[1]->[Equalizer].\n\nIn previous section, I roughly explained how to design(implement) Precoder. Simply put, take the channel matrix (H) and do SVD of the matrix and take the unitary matrix of the SVD result.\n\nSound simple ? Maybe... Anyway let's assume that it sound simple and everybody understand this -:)\n\nHowever, in reality there is a critical issues that were not mentioned above. In previous section, the channel matrix H should be given to find Precoding matrix. Next question is, who (transmitter or reciever) can figure out H. It is the reciever because the reciever(UE in this case) can perform the channel estimation based on specific reference signal transmitted by the transmitter (eNB in this case). However, the precoding matrix is needed at transmitter(eNB).\n\nThen, how can the transmitter know of the precoding matrix ? Conceptually the simplest way would be that the reciever (UE) notify eNB of the whole precoding matrix. This is simple only in concept, but it is not simple to implement since it would require pretty big bandwidth to send the whole precoding matrix and this can be a huge overhead.\n\nTo workaround this kind of overhead problem, 3GPP came up with a little bit of short cut as described below. In this method, they predefines a set of matrix based on the extensive investigation of the radio channel during the standardization process. These predefined matrix are known to both UE and eNB.\n\nAnd then UE select a specific precoder(precoding matrix) based on the its own channel estimation and informs eNB of the index of the precoding matrix that it selected. Since this is only the index of the matrix (not the matrix itself), we can implement this method without causing much overhead.\n\nFor some MIMO implementation (e.g, TM4 in LTE = Closed Loop MIMO), you estimate the channel and select a specific precoding matrix and send it back to the receiver as shown below.\n\nThe algorithm by which UE select the codebook which is best fit for the channel at specific moment is as follows.\n\nOnce a specific codebook element (precoding matrix) is selected as shown here, that precoding matrix is used to transform the incoming bits as explained in Precoding section.\n\nNow you know about various aspect of MIMO channel model and conceptual mathematical representation. I hope it make sense to you at least in terms of mathematically. But as you know, when you try to implement the mathematical model into a real system, almost always you would meet something you haven't imagined when you are playing only in mathematical world.\n\nCan you guess what is known variable and what is unknown variable for each side (reciever and transmitter side) ? We can think of followings as a kind of known variables.\n\nThe issue is how to figure out the matrix V. About this matrix, there are two main problems.\n\nOne of the most common solution for this is that the reciever analyze channel matrix (H) and inform the transmitter of the best matrix V. This is called 'Closed loop MIMO' and LTE TM4 (Transmission Mode 4) belongs to this category.\n\nNow this kind of closed-loop method can solve all the problems listed above ? Unfortunately No.\n\nThe term Rank Indicator came from the pure mathematical term Rank Index. So, simply put, Rank Indicator is a special kind of UE measurement that reports Rank Index.\n\nPutting it in more practical aspect, Rank Indicator is a kind of number (indicator) that represents how well a MIMO communication works. For example, let's assume that a UE is communicating with a eNB with 2x2 MIMO configuration and UE reports RI(Rank Indicator) of '2', it implies that the 2x2 MIMO is performing as a real MIMO fashion. However, if UE reports RI of '1', it implies that the communication is going on as if it is with single antenna. It means that the 2x2 MIMO is not performing with the best efficiency.\n\nLet's remind us of the definition of Singular Matrix. It is defined as follows. It is a diagonal matrix. Once you get the singular matrix of a channel you can extract a couple of very important information from it.\n\nOne of the most important information you can get from the singular matrix is Rank Indicator. Rank Indicator is defined as Number of the diagonal elements which is not zero. Physical meaning of Rank Indicator is the number of independent communication channel. In case of 2 x 2 Singular matrix (for 2 x 2 MIMO) as an example, if the Rank Indictor is 2. Both diagonal elements as shown below\nis non-zero value and two separate communication pipe is established. If the Rank Indicator of the matrix is 1, one of the diagonal element (Lamda 1 or Lamda 2) is zero. It means even though we setup two antenna, the really working data stream is only 1, implying that the signal from one of the antenna is totally got lost or burried under noise which cannot be decoded.\n\nFollowing plot is from the data captured by a drive test tool Azenqos Drive Test tool (AZQ Android). I got the log captured by the tool and exported the data as csv file and then plot it on Microsoft Excel. The map displaying the path of the measurement shown at the bottom is the one automatically created by AZQ reporting tool.\n\nIn this specific example, you would see a considerable amount of report with RI = 1, it implies that in many case 2x2 MIMO does not work with the full efficiency.\n\nThen you might have question. Rank Indictor cares only on the number of non-zero values in the singular matrix. Does this mean that the amount of these number doesn't matter ? For example, isn't there any difference in terms of real communication performance between (lamda1 = 1, lamda2 = 1) and (lamda1 = 2, lamda2 = 0.1) ? In both case, Rank Indicator is same but real communication performance\nis different. So in order to properly estimate the real performance of MIMO channel we may need another indicator, that indicator is Condition Number as defined as below (according to reference [1]. I strongly recommend you to read this reference)\n\nAs stated above, as the difference among the diagonal numbers are less and less, the more optimal the MIMO channel works. Following graph from [1] shows this property. Horizonal axis indicates Condition Number in dB unit and Vertical Axis indicates the SNR in dB unit. Each line shows the case where the same amount of data rate is achieved. Each points on\nthe line indicate 'To achieve a certain performance(data rate) at a certain condition number, how much SNR is required ?\". or you can interpret it as \"How much performance (data rate) you can get when you were given a certain condition number and a certain SNR\".\n\nFor example, let's look at the point labed (B). This point tells \"In this specific communication system, when the condition number is 10 dB and SNR is 20 dB, we can achieve max 12 bits/s/Hz data rate\". In order words, \"to achieve 12 Bits/s/Hz data rate at the condition number 10 dB, we need at least 20 dB SNR\".\n\nNow let's look at point (A). It tells \"In this specific communication system, when the condition number is 0 dB and SNR is 16 dB, we can achieve max 12 bits/s/Hz data rate\". In order words, \"to achieve 12 Bits/s/Hz data rate at the condition number 0 dB, we need at least 16 dB SNR\".\n\nWhat would you tell if you compare point (A) and point (B) ? At both points, we can achive the same performance (data rate), but at point (A) we could achieve the data rate even with poorer SNR comparing to point (B). In other words, as Condition Number get closer to 0 dB, we can achieve the data rate with poorer SNR.\n\nTry to pick some other places and describe the situation as I did until you get familiar with the interpretation of the graph and you will get the practical understanding of Condition Number.\n\nNow let's look into a couple of example of channel matrix and see how/what information we can get out of them. The example matrix itself comes from reference [1] and the tool that I used to perform SVD is reference [2] (Wolfram Alpha).\n\nFirst example goes as follows. Can you visualize the physical setup of transmitter and reciever from this matrix ?\n\nSince it is 2 x 2, you would have two transmitter antenna and two reciever antenna. It is 2 x 2 matrix. The elements except those on diagonal line are all zero. It means that there is no crosstalk between each antenna path. All the elements in the diagonal line are all '1'. It means 100% energy from transmitter antenna 1 is delivered to reciever antenna 1 without any loss and 100% energy\nfrom transmitter antenna 2 is delivered to reciever antenna 2 without any loss. Of course, you would never have this kind of condition in real wireless communication. But you can have this kind of condition when you do a lab test connecting 2 DUD antenna to 2 communication port on a test equipment.\n\nNow let's do SVD to get Singular Matrix. Using Wolfram Alpha, I got the following result.\n\nNow let's extract some information from the singular matrix. First.. what is Rank Indicator value ? It is 2 since the number of Non-zero elements on diagonal line is 2.\n\nThen let's take the condition number. It is '1' as shown below. It means it is perfect condition for spatial multiplexing and you should have maximum performance from this channel.\n\nSecond example goes as follows. Can you visualize the physical setup of transmitter and reciever from this matrix ?\n\nSince it is 2 x 2, you would have two transmitter antenna and two reciever antenna. It is 2 x 2 matrix. All the elements even non-diagonal elements are none zero. It means that there is crosstalk in all the possible ways. All the elements in the matrix are are same value which is 1/sqrt(2). It means 50% energy from transmitter antenna 1 is delivered to reciever antenna 1 and\nanother 50% energy from transmitter antenna 1 is delivered to reciever antenna 2. and it also means 50% energy from transmitter antenna 2 is delivered to reciever antenna 1 and another 50% energy from transmitter antenna 2 is delivered to reciever antenna 2.\n\nNow let's do SVD to get Singular Matrix. Using Wolfram Alpha, I got the following result.\n\nNow let's extract some information from the singular matrix. First.. what is Rank Indicator value ? It is 1 since the number of Non-zero elements on diagonal line is only 1.\n\nThen let's take the condition number. In pure mathematical sense, it cannot be calculated since the denominator is zero. But in practical sense, you can think of '0' as a very small number. In that case, you can get the condition number as shown below which is very large number. It means this channel is the worst condition for MIMO.\n\nThird example goes as follows. Can you visualize the physical setup of transmitter and reciever from this matrix ?\n\nSince it is 2 x 2, you would have two transmitter antenna and two reciever antenna. It is 2 x 2 matrix. All the elements even non-diagonal elements are none zero. It means that there is crosstalk in all the possible ways, but the value between diagonal element and non-diagonal elements has 90 degree phase shift. It means 50% energy from transmitter antenna 1 is delivered to reciever\nantenna 1 and another 50% energy from transmitter antenna 1 is delivered to reciever antenna 2 with 90 degree phase shift. and it also means 50% energy from transmitter antenna 2 is delivered to reciever antenna 1 with 90 degree phase shift and another 50% energy from transmitter antenna 2 is delivered to reciever antenna 2. It means two signals transmitted from two transmitter antenna and comming into one reciever antenna does not interfere at all.\n\nNow let's do SVD to get Singular Matrix. Using Wolfram Alpha, I got the following result.\n\nNow let's extract some information from the singular matrix. First.. what is Rank Indicator value ? It is 2 since the number of Non-zero elements on diagonal line is 2.\n\nThen let's take the condition number. It is calculated to be 1 which means the perfect condition for MIMO. As you see here, even though there is cross talk between two communication path. It can be a very good condition for MIMO depending on the characteristics of the crosstalk. Would there be any way to implement this kind of channel condition ? Yes.. there is. If you cross polarize the\nantenna,you can have this kind of channel condition.\n\nHere goes another example which can be more realistic. Can you visualize the physical setup of transmitter and reciever from this matrix ?\n\nSince it is 2 x 2, you would have two transmitter antenna and two reciever antenna. It is 2 x 2 matrix. All the elements even non-diagonal elements are none zero. It means that there is crosstalk in all the possible ways, but it is not easy to intuitively know exactly how much engergy goes to which antenna. Of course you can calculate this by taking the magnitue and angle of all\nof these complex numbers.. but let's just think of intuitive meaning. Since the magnitude and angle of all the elements are not the same, the crosstalk between the communication paths would not go 100% destructive way.\n\nIn this kind of situation, SVD can play important role. I got the result as below using Wolfram Alpha.\n\nNow let's extract some information from the singular matrix. First.. what is Rank Indicator value ? It is 2 since the number of Non-zero elements on diagonal line is 2.\n\nThen let's take the condition number. It is calculated to be 1.6563 which is not the best case for MIMO and not the worst case either. It is less than 3 in dB unit. If you plug this number into the graph you saw above, it is pretty good condition for MIMO.\n\nNote : for more intuitive understandings on how SVD is used for precoding and equalization process, I posted another type of tutorial at www.slide4math.com Go go [Engineering]->[1]->[Equalizer].\n\nIn early stage of LTE deployment, most of UE supported only Category 3 or 4. In this case it is assumed that both Network and UE can support up to only 2x2 MIMO.\n\nHowever, recently (as of Jul 2017) we see the UEs and Networks supporting more than 2 antenna and all of the following MIMO configurations are becoming a common capability.\n\nWith these many options, Network need to know of the exact UE capability of Antenna configuration. Technically UE does not need to know about the network capability because UE is supposed to use whatever the network ask for, it is up to Network to figure out UE capability and configure the MIMO configuration not to exceed UE capability. However, there is way by which a UE can figure out Network (eNB) antenna configuration as well.\n\nHow a UE can figure out the MIMO Capability of eNB : UE can figure out how many antenna eNB is using by checking PBCH CRC Mask. However, UE can figure out only the number of Antenna that eNB is using, it cannot figure out whether the Network can use all those antenna in MIMO or the Network use them in diversity purpose until it reaches RRC Connection Setup or RRC Connection Reconfiguration.\n\nHow a NW can figure out the MIMO Capability of UE : Network can figure out the MIMO capability of UE via UE Capability Information message. Actually UE Capability Information does not carry any explicit information of UE MIMO capability. However Network can figure out UE MIMO capability indirectly from UE Category reported in UE Capability Information message. In UE Category table, you can figure out the number of layers that can be supported. From this information, the Network can indirectly figure out UE MIMO capability. For example, if the UE category says the UE category support the number of layer 2, it implies that the UE would support 2x2 or 4x2. If the UE category says the UE category support the number of layer 4, it implies that the UE would support 4x4\n\n+-lateNonCriticalExtension ::= OCTET STRING CONSTRAINTED [0000000101101010] OPTIONAL:Exist",

Tech.: Reference Signal\n\nIn Wireless communication, it is unavoidable for the signal from transmitter to go through noisy and fading media(environment) and get corrupted and distorted. So there should be a special mechanism to remove(at least reduce) the noise and compensate the fading at the receiver side. One common way to do this is to use a specifically designed signal which are known to both transmitter and reciever. The transmitter transmit the known signal and the known signal also goes through noisy and faded media and eventually reach the reciever. The reciever detects the special signal and check how the signal get distorted and figure out how to 'undo' (compensate) the distortion. This specific signal is called reference signal.\n\nDifferent Radio Technology use different types of Rerence signals. Since there is no single type of reference signal that fits every types of signal distortion (e.g, phase noise, timing error, amplitude noise etc), the experts designed various types of reference signals depending on specific purpose.",

For example, there can be one network slice for IoT, another one for supporting \"classic\" UEs and another one for V2X. More generally, there can be different requirements on functionality (e.g., priority, policy control), differences in performance requirements (e.g., latency, mobility and data rates), or they can serve only specific types of users (e.g., MPS users, Public Safety users, corporate customers, roamers, or hosting an MVNO). The different slices can be used simultaneously.\n\nEnd-to-end Network slicing is a major characteristic of the 5G System. It is supported by every deployed PLMN to the extent necessary to interoperate with other PLMNs, e.g. the IoT slice from operator A can interconnect directly with the IoT slice of operator B. Based on business scenario, the operator can decide how many network slices to deploy and what functions/features to share across multiple slices.\n\nThe characteristics of each slice are defined in terms of QoS, bit rate, latency, etc. For a given slice, these characteristics are either predefined in the 3GPP Standard or are operator-defined. There are three types of predefined slices: type 1 is dedicated to the support of eMBB, type 2 is for URLLC and type 3 is for MIoT support. These predefinitions allow inter-PLMN operation with reduced coordination effort between operators. As for the operator-defined slices, they enable more differentiation among network slices.\n\nA dedicated NF is introduced for slices handling: the \"Network Slice Selection Function\" (NSSF), which enables the selection of the appropriate slice(s). The UEs may use multiple Network Slices simultaneously. The Network Slice Selection policies in the UE links applications to Network slices.\n\nNetwork slicing also supports roaming scenarios.

In order to support these charging mechanisms, the network performs real-time monitoring of resource usage on the above three levels in order to detect the relevant chargeable events. The charging levels are further described in clause 5.3.\n\nIn offline charging, the resource usage is reported from the network to the BD after the resource usage has occurred. In online charging, a subscriber account, located in an OCS or CCS, is queried prior to granting permission to use the requested network resource(s).\n\nTypical examples of network resource usage are a voice call of certain duration, the transport of a certain volume of data, or the submission of a MM of a certain size. The network resource usage requests may be initiated by the UE (MO case) or by the network (MT case).\n\nOffline and online charging may be performed simultaneously and independently for the same chargeable event. Clause 5.5 provides further insight into potential utilisation of the charging information produced by the offline and online charging mechanisms.\n\n4.1.1\tOffline charging\n\nOffline charging is a process where charging information for network resource usage is collected concurrently with that resource usage. The charging information is then passed through a chain of logical charging functions that are further explained in clause 4.3.1 and clause 4.3.3. At the end of this process, CDR files are generated by the network, which are then transferred to the network operator's BD for the purpose of subscriber billing and/or inter-operator accounting (or additional functions, e.g. statistics, at the operator's discretion). The BD typically comprises post-processing systems such as the operator's billing system or billing mediation device.\n\nIn conclusion, offline charging is a mechanism where charging information does not affect, in real-time, the service rendered.\n\n4.1.2\tOnline charging\n\nOnline charging is a process where charging information for network resource usage is collected concurrently with that resource usage in the same fashion as in offline charging. However, authorization for the network resource usage must be obtained by the network prior to the actual resource usage to occur. This authorization is granted by the OCS or CCS upon request from the network.\n\nWhen receiving a network resource usage request, the network assembles the relevant charging information and generates a charging event towards the OCS or CCS in real-time. The OCS or CCS then returns an appropriate resource usage authorization. The resource usage authorization may be limited in its scope (e.g. volume of data or duration), therefore the authorization may have to be renewed from time to time as long as the user's network resource usage persists.\n\nNote that the charging information utilized in online charging is not necessarily identical to the charging information employed in offline charging.\n\nIn conclusion, online charging is a mechanism where charging information can affect, in real-time, the service rendered and therefore a direct interaction of the charging mechanism with the control of network resource usage is required.\n\n4.1.3\tConverged charging\n\nConverged charging is a process where online and offline charging are combined. The charging information is utilized by CCS in one converged charging service which offers charging with and without quota management, as well as charging information record generation.",

SUPL operations must take place in combination with control-plane procedures over NRPPa.\n\nThis situation could arise in the case of UE-assisted OTDOA, for example, in which the SLP needs to provide the UE (in a SUPL session) with assistance data supplied by the NG-RAN. This clause uses a UE-assisted OTDOA positioning operation as an example.\n\nAlthough the positioning server in this operation is the SLP, the existence of an interface to the LMF means that the SLP can communicate with the LMF via the SPC. In particular, this means that assistance data that was delivered to the LMF via NRPPa can be transferred over to the SLP for delivery to the UE via LPP over SUPL.\n\nThere are several ways to realise this general behaviour. In the simplest case, the LMF could be supplied with the necessary assistance data in advance, so that it can be supplied to the SLP without any actual NRPPa procedures taking place in real time (and possibly even before the positioning transaction begins).\n\nIn the event that the LMF does not have the required assistance data available, it would need to retrieve them from the NG-RAN once it was made aware that they were needed.\n\nIn both cases, it should be noted that the retrieval of the assistance data is transparent to the UE and to the actual SUPL session. This model is parallel to the approach used with A-GNSS, in which assistance data such as satellite ephemerides are retrieved from sources entirely external to the cellular network. For purposes of LPP over SUPL, the delivery of assistance data to the SLP can be viewed as an independent external process.\n\nThe delivery of assistance data to the UE, however, takes place through the same mechanisms as control-plane LPP, transported through SUPL.\n\nAnnex B (informative):\nChange history",

The process of directed retry involves the assignment of a Mobile Station to a radio channel on a cell other than the serving cell. This process is triggered by the assignment procedures, as described in 3GPP TS 48.008, and employs internal or external handover procedures as described in clauses 6 and 7. The successful procedure for a directed retry is as shown in figure 40 and as described below.\nIf during the assignment phase, as represented by the A-ASSIGNMENT-REQUEST message, a handover becomes necessary, due to either radio conditions or congestion, then the Mobile Station may be handed over to a different cell. When the decision has been made to handover the MS the BSS-A may send an A-ASSIGNMENT-FAILURE message, indicating 'directed retry', before sending the A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message to MSCA, indicating 'directed retry'. However BSS-A may alternatively send the A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message, indicating 'directed retry', without sending the A-ASSIGNMENT-FAILURE message. Other cause values may be used instead of \"Directed Retry\" in the A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message, this will allow the MSC to take different actions dependent on the received cause. Upon receipt of the A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message from BSS-A, then MSCA shall initiate the handover as described in clauses 6 and 7. No resources shall be cleared in the MSCA or BSS-A for this connection.\n\nAfter receipt of the A-HANDOVER-COMPLETE message from BSS-B the assignment procedure shall be considered to be complete and the resources on BSS-A shall be cleared.\nIf a failure occurs during the handover attempt, for example A-HANDOVER-FAILURE returned from BSS-A or BSS-B, then MSCA will terminate the handover to BSS-B. Under these conditions MSCA may optionally take one of a number of actions:\nThe procedures for Inter-MSC handover are also applicable to the directed retry process.

    "context": "https://www.sharetechnote.com/html/IoT/IoT_WhatToChoose.html\n\nIoT: What to choose\n\nNow let's assume that you got the full unstanding of each of the IoT related technology individually and did a little bit of categorization, you may come up with some daisy chain like diagram as illustrated below.\n\nWhat is confusing you would not be the technical details of each individual technology. What confuse you would about 'how one technology differs from other technologies ?' or 'which technology I have to chose for my application or use model ?'\n\nThe simple answer to the question \"Which technology do I have to pick for my application or my use model ?\" is \"It depends on the nature of your application\".\n\nI know.. you would not take this as an answer. You would ask for more specific answers.\n\nIf you want to get more specific answers, you would have specific answers to a lot of specific questions as listed below. (This list would get extended as learn/observe more from various discussions/forums).\n\nI would not put my comments on each of the questions for now.. just to give you some time for you to think.. (good excuse for my laziness :)).\n\nThis is basically asking about the data rate of the end node in your IoT system. Is it collecting a simple data like Temperature, Humidity which takes up only several bytes at a time of transmission. Normally this kind of IoT device should be very low cost. It is less likely to let this kind of device to use relatively expensive network (like cellular network).\n\nThis is asking 'Are you going to use a simple sensors (like temperature, humidity) ?' or some other devices which requires a relatively large packet transmission/reception or which requires very high level data security.\n\nThis would be highly related to Q1. Usually the type of data to be collected and transmitted would determine the necessary data rate, but there might be some exceptions. For example, if you need very sophisticated data security and add a lot of additional portions to the original data to implement the security, the data rate that you would need would get much higher. Another exception can be the case where you want to upgrade/reconfigure your end-node remotely. Of course, this would not happen very often but if you really want to do this, the data rate should be pretty high for the end-node to download necessary firmware and configuration information.\n\nQ4. Does your end node device will both transmit and receive data ? or only transmit the data (no recieve) ?\n\nMost of the IoT application is Uplink centeric (transmission only in terms of end-device) and in some extreme case there are some application that is uplink only. It is understandable for most of IoT application to be Uplink dominant but there would be a lot of restriction if it goes with uplink only. For example, you have a very simple end-device (e.g, a temperature sensor) and transmitted it to a Gateway or Basestation. If the device is uplink only (transmission only), the device can only transmit the data and there is no way to verify whther it successfully reached the destination or not. To verify the successful transmission of the data, there should be some mechanism by which the destination (e.g, Gateway) can send Acknowledge message to the device that has sent the data. To do this, the system should allow downlink (i.e, reception in terms of end-device). Also, if you want to apply any form of data security or remote re-configuration or remote update, you need both uplink and downlink.\n\nLet me ask another question before this .. Are you going to use unlicensed band/frequency (i.e ISM band) or a licensed band / frequency (e.g, Cellular) ? If you decided to use ISM band, it is highly likely to use sub Ghz band (i.e, around 900 Mhz) or around 2.4 Ghz frequency. If you decided to use licensed band, it will be determined by which frequency will be allowed in the area where your IoT system will be installed.\n\nIf you selected unlicensed band, you are free to use any of the frequency .. but it is not only you who is free to use the frequency.. there might be a lot of other devices that uses the same frequency which might cause unwanted interference. If you decided to use the licensed frequency, there will be licensing / permission issue.\n\nIf the transmitter and reciever is communicating within the range of couple of meters or tens of meters, you can use many of the existing short range communication like Bluetooth, ZigBee etc. However, if it should extend to several km or tens of km, you have to use those technologies that can cover wide range like LPWAN (e.g, LoRa, SigFox etc) or Cellular technology.\n\nBasically IoT requires a cirtain type of Network structure whether it is small or large (in most case it is not peer to peer communication). Then you would have question on how to form such a network and how much control you want to have over the whole network. Some people would say 'I want to implement only the end Node(e.g, terminal sensor module) and get it connected to an exisiting network that are already established'. In this case, you would consider Cellular based IoT or SigFox. In this option, you would have less work to do but very limitted or no controllability for network. Some people would say 'I want to implement everything from the end node to the network and I want to have full control over the network'. In this case, you may like LoRa type of technology. You would have full controllability, but downside is that there are a lot of works for you to do.\n\nFor example, SKT deployed a Nation wide IoT service in South Korea around the end of 2016 based on LoRa technology. According to Ref [5], they were considering LoRa, SigFox, NB-LTE(and other LTE based IoT). LTE IoT was excluded for other reason, but between LoRa and SigFox, the controllability to Network was one of the factor to select LoRa.\n\nQ10. Do you need any security for the data being transmitted and received ? At which level, if you need ?\n\nI personally think this is pretty important issue since there are many cases where it is not easy to change / upgrade the software of a IoT end node once it is installed or take too much cost to visit every installation points and change software of the device. However, I don't see this issues widely discussed in the industry yet (as of early 2017). Probably they are afraid to bring up the issues that does not have any simple / easy solution. In theory, the smartest solution is to let the end node device itself to download the new software and upgrade it by itself. We have seen this type of software upgrade in cellular phone (smart phone) pretty commonly these days. We may think of utilizing the similar technologies to IoT devices. However, the biggest problem would be the bandwidth. Most of IoT device is designed for low data rate communication, but this kind of wireless software upgrade would take pretty big bandwidth. So if you think of this kind of wireless software upgrade, you would need to choose such a technology to provide big enough bandwidth for wireless woftware upgrade.\n\nQ12. What kind of protocol (phy, mac, application layer protocol) do you want to use ?\n\nThere are many different technologies that claim to be the best for IoT. Some of them would already be available at your time of deployment, but some technologies would be being talked a lot but not available or not mature yet. So if your deployment schedule is very near, you would need to choose a technology that are mature right now.\n\nFor example, SKT deployed a Nation wide IoT service in South Korea around the end of 2016 based on LoRa technology. According to Ref [5], they were considering LoRa, SigFox, NB-LTE(and other LTE based IoT). SigFox were excluded for other reason, but between LoRa and SigFox, LoRa was selected mainly due to availability. LoRa technology was already there when they were planning, but there were still a couple of years to go for LTE based IoT to be mature enough.\n\n[3] NarrowBand IoT Demystified: What are the benefits and why do we need it?

A fallback operation to the legacy timing of n+4 is still supported by scheduling from the common search space (CSS), while the short processing time is applicable when scheduling from the user-specific search space (USS). The fallback results in possible collision between n+4 and n+3 timing in different/same DL subframe and/or same/different UL subframe. For example, the use of fallback results in possible uplink collision in the PUCCH format 1/1a/1b resource usage for the same UE when the two DL subframes have been scheduled targeting HARQ feedback in the same UL subframe. Collision handling has been specified to ensure a consistent UE behaviour.\n\nShort processing time is configured per component carrier (CC) by RRC and applies to both DL assignment to HARQ feedback and UL grant to UL transmission.\n\nShort processing time is associated with asynchronous HARQ operation on the UL, and hence PHICH is no longer considered for HARQ feedback of n+3 based scheduling (PHICH is still used for synchronous n+4 based scheduling). HARQ processes on DL are shared between n+4 and n+3 based scheduling, while there is no sharing of HARQ processes between synchronous (n+4) and asynchronous (n+3) HARQ on the UL. The HARQ content for a given UL subframe m can consist of HARQ bits for n+3 carriers as well as HARQ bits for n+4 carriers at the same time.\n\nSimilar to HARQ, shortened processing time also applies to CSI, so that a UE configured with shortened processing time for 1ms TTI will measure CSI on a reference resource no less than 3 subframes away (nCQI_ref greater or equal to 3) from the CSI report. For TM10, the legacy value of the delay between the CSI reference and the CSI report is reduced by 1 subframe (nCQI_ref = legacy value -1).\n\nSRS timing for UE configured with Short processing time is such that for a trigger received in subframe n, aperiodic SRS is transmitted in the first available subframe n+3 or later, subject to the given UL subframe being configured for SRS transmission.\n\nWhen the processing time is shortened, the timing advance takes up a proportionally larger part of the overall processing time available to the UE. A consequence of this is that the maximum timing advance for a CC configured with short processing time is reduced from 667 us to 200 us.",

Tech.: Fading\n\nIntuitive understanding of Fading would be simple, but the detailed description is pretty difficult and would be even more difficult to understand the details without going through the complicated mathematical process. This page would start with Intuitive description and try to keep adding the details one by one. It will take long time to complete the pages and will split this into multiple pages if it goes too long.\n\nIn most of the wireless communication environement, a signal out of a transmitter radiate into wide direction and these radiated signal takes different path and arriving at the reciever at different timing and with different signal strength(amplitude). As a result, the signal coming into the reciever is the composite of all the components. As you may learned in high school physics, when thetwo\ncopies of the signal get combined the resulting signal can be an augmented signal or attenuated signal depending on whether the two signal constructively combined or destructively combined.\n\nThen what determines whether the signals constructively combine or destructively combine ? The answer also come from high school physics. The phase of the two signal determines whether the signal constructively combine or destructively combine.\n\nIn wireless communication environment, many copies of the signals get combined at the reciever side and some of them constructively combines and some of them destructively combines. So final result of combination of all the incoming signals become very complicated and the combined signal becomes drastically different from the original signal tranmitted from the source. In most case, the quality\nof the combined signal at the reciever gets poorer (deteriorated) than the original signal. This kind of process of signal deterioration by the multiple propogation path of a signal is called 'Fading'. When we say \"Fading\", it usually implies \"Signal quality gets bad\".\n\nFor more intuitive unerstanding of the fading, I will show you a couple of different aspect of fading you can mesure using various equipments.\n\nFirst, let's compare a faded signal and non-faded signal using a spectrum analyzer. You would get the two results as follows and you will see the highly fluctuating amplitude across the channel bandwidth. (Note : These two capture are not the one from the same signal, so comparing the absolute value of the amplitude does not make any sense. Just take the image of overall amplitude profile).\n\nNow let's look at how the fading influence the signal quality decoded by the reciever. Look at the following samples of constellation for faded and non-faded signal.\n\nNow let's get into even further and I think this is the thing that you would be most interested in. How this fading would influence the final performance. Following graph shows the data rate at PHY layer and PDCP layer. The plot showing at the top (labeled as 'PHY Transmission Rate') is the amount of data being transmitted per second by PHY layer of the transmitter. The plot in the middle\n(labeled as 'PHY throughput with HARQ ACK' is the amount of data getting ACKED per second from the reiever PHY layer. You see there is pretty much gap between the two plots. It means that a considerable portions of the data were failed to get properly decoded by the reciever and the reciever sent NACK for the data. Normally in this case, the transmitter PHY layer retransmits the previous data rather than moving into the next step of the transmission.\n\nThe plot at the bottom (labelled as 'PDCP Transmission Rate') is the amount of data being sent to the lower layer from the transmitter's PDCP layer. You will see another gap here. It is not easy to explain exactly what is causing this gap. In this case, some portions of the gap would come from the overhead of higher layer data structure but majority of the gap would be because PDCP cannot\npush the data down to the lower layer since PHY layer is too busy with retransmitting the previous data rather than transmitting the new data coming from the higher layer.\n\nThere are many factors generating Fading effect. Followings are the list of components (factors) of fading we can think of.\n\nTo study on fading requires the detailed understanding of each of these components. If I express some major components in visual form, it can be presented as follows. Just from the high level view, you should see some typtical pattern from this representation. First notice that the horizontal axis represents 'Distance in Linear Scale'. You may have seen a lot of different plots in various\ntextbook and get confused by those. One of the first step to remove those confusion would be clearly understanding the meaning of axis of the graph. Even for the same things, you would see different shape of plots if you define the meaning of the axis differently. One of the factors from various text confusing you the most is the scale of each axis. For example, in case of path loss graph in some textbook where they represent the axis in log scale you would see a straight line, but in this page you\nare seeing a kind of negative exponential graph since the axis is represented in linear scale.\n\nPath loss is just gradually decreases but not much of fluctuation. In the second plot, you see some fluctuation of the signal strength but the fluctuation frequency over the distance is not that high. In the third plot, you see fluctuations of signal strength and the fluctuation frequency is also pretty high.\n\nWhen you observe a real received signal, you wouldn't see these factors in separate form as in the graph on the left side. What you see at the real reciever is the result of summation of all the factors and it is like the graph on the right side.\n\nProbably the words you might have heard the most frequently when you talking about fading would be 'Fast Fading', 'Slow Fading'. Intuitively it sounds simple. But not easy to find clear/technical defintion for these. How fast it should be to be Fast Fading ? How slow it should be to be Slow Fading ?\n\nI found a very good definition and technical explanation from the reference [2]. It states as follows:\n\nFast Fading is used to describe channels in which Channel Coherence Time < Tansmission Symbol Time. Fast Fading describes a condition where the time duration in which the channel behaves in a correlated mannel is short compared to the time duration of a symbol. Therefore, it can be expected that the fading characteristic of the channel will change several times while a symbol is propagating, leading to distortion of the baseband pulse shape. Analogous to the distortion described as ISI, the distortion take place because the recieved signal's components are not all highly correlated throughout time. Hence, fast fading can cause the baseband pulse to be distorted, resulting in a loss of SNR that often yields an irreducible error rate. Such distorted pulses cause synchronization problems (failure of phase-locked-loop recievers), in addition to difficulties in adequately defining a matched filter.\n\nSlow Fading is used to describe channels in which Channel Coherence Time > Tansmission Symbol Time. Here, the time duration that the channel behaves in a correlated manner is long compared to the time duration of a transmission symbol. Thus, one can expect the channel state to virtually remain unchanged during the time in which a symbol is transmitted. The propaging symbols will likely not suffer from the pulse distortion. The primary degradation in a slow-fading channel, as with flat fading, is loss in SNR.\n\nPath Loss and Shadowing may not be considered to be a part of Fading in narrow sense, but it can be considered as a factor causing the fading in wider sense. Understanding or Modeling the path loss is not that difficult. You may see a mathematical model which you were faimilar with in your high school math. The famous format of anti-proportional to 'something squared'.\n\nModling for Path Loss is done with the respect to the distance between a transmitter and receiver. The key question is ..\n\nTest A) When a transmitter antenna is transmitting a certain (fixed) amount of energy and you put a measurement antenna which is a certain distance (let's call this distance as 'd') and measure the received(measured) energy. Once you get the value at a certain 'd', write down the value. And then move the reciever antenna a little bit further and do the same measurement and write down\nthe value. Repeat this process as you move 'd' further and further and collect all the measured value and plot it on the graph with horizontal axis = d and vertical axis = measured energy level (power). How would the plot look like ? Can you come up with an equation to represent the graph ?\n\nTest B) Now let's try a little bit different type of measurement. This time, draw a circle with radius d with the transmitter antenna at the center. and then put several antenna along the circumference and measure the received power at each antenna and plot the value with horizontal axis = location of receiver antenna and vertical axis = measured energy level (power). How would the\nplot look like ?\n\nTest C) Now let's think about two test environment. In one setup there is no obstacles between the reciever and transmitter antenna (Let's call this as 'Setup A'). In the other setup, there are a lot of obstacles (like building, tree, houses, mountain etc) between the transmitter antenna and reciever antenna (Let's call this as 'Setup B'). Then you do the measurement described in Test\nB) for both setup and compare the result. Would you see any difference ? what kind of difference would you see ?\n\nThese three test will be used as a basis for modeling following cases. (Details will come later)\n\nThe first thing we can think of is a kind of ideal case called 'Free Space'. In this case, we assume that there is no obstacles between the transmitter and reciever antenna.\n\nIn this case, the measured power at every reciever antenna at the same distance from the transmitter antenna would be same and the received signal power can be modeled as follows. (Basically this equation is a form of Frris' Transmission Equation )\n\nIf you want to convert this equation to a form which most of RF engineers are more familiar with (dBm scale), you can just apply 10 log( ) on both side and go through following steps. Of course, you don't have to memorize the each of these steps. Just try to understand overall concept and logic of this process.\n\nLife would be much easier if the condition between the transmission antenna and reciever antenna is always as decribed in previous case (Free Space).\n\nIn real life situation, it is highly likely that you would see a lot of obstacles (like building, Tree, mountain etc). If I draw this situation in a little bit simplified way, it would be as follows.\n\nThe path loss at a certain distance can be expressed as follows. Compare this with the free space case. What kind of difference do you see ?\n\nIn case of free space model, once the distance is determined the received power can be determined automatically meaning that if d is fixed(same), you would get the same measured value (recieved power) for every measurement. But in this case, you cannot gurantee the same measured value even though the distance is same. Even though d is same, you would get the different measured value if beta\n(Path Loss Exponent) is different or epsilon (Random Variable) is different.\n\nThen the question would be 'How the Path Loss Exponent and Random Variable is determined ?'. There is no strict theory that can determine these values deterministically. It is usually determined empirically. According to various researches,\n\nIf you apply Log (10 log[ ] more specifically) to both side, you can get a linear equation in dB (dBm) scalse as shown below.\n\nA defining characteristic of the mobile wireless channel is to build up a mathematical model for the variations of the channel strength over time and over frequency. There are mainly two factors influencing the variations of the channel strength as listed below.\n\nAs a starting point, please... please ... please ... read very carefully about the section of Signal Presentation, Impulse Response and Convolution section before you go deeper into this section.\n\nLet's suppose we have a case as shown below. A UE is communicating with a eNodeB and there is a lot of building between the UE and the eNodeB. You may intuitively guess the eNodeB would get the multiple copies of the same signal from UE because the same signal can reach the eNodeB via multiple path as shown below. Let's assume that we have four different path as shown below. There are two\nmajor characteristics of the paths. One is attenuation and the other one is time delay. Of course there would be several additional factors, but these two components would be the largest factors. Let's assume that each of the path has the delay and attenuation as shown below.\n\nHow do we represent a channel using these delay and attenuator factor ? There can be a couple of different ways to represent it, but one of the most common way would be to represent it as an impulse response model. Even though you may not familiar with the term 'impulse response', you may have seen this kind of description if you have any experience of using channel simulators (fader) and\ndealt with fading profile. Following is the graphical representation of impulse response of the four paths in this example and physical meaning of it. I hope this make sense to you.\n\nIf you represent this impulse response into a mathematical form, it become as follows. If you are not familiar with this kind of mathematical representation. Read again the section of Signal Representation. (When you are first learning this way of signal representation.. you may think .. what the hell is delta function\n? Why we need this kind of function ? etc... this is one example why you need to learn those textbook concept).\n\nLet's look into a example that (hopefully) would give you more concrete understanding of these concepts.\n\nLet's suppose that a signal goes through six different path (multipath) as indicated in plot (1). Horizontal axis represents the time delay from the transmission to arrival at the reciever antenna. Vertical axis indicates the amplitude of the received signal. plot(2)~(7) shows the signal going through each path reaching to Rx antenna. If you look at each plots, you would notice that the phase\n(time delay) and amplitude are different from each other. plot (8) shows the summation of all the plots from (2) through (6). This is the signal being sensed by the recieving antenna.\n\nWhat do you observe from the plot (8) (the sum of all the multipath signal) ? You would notice that the amplitude and phase gets different from the transmitted signal, but overall shape of the signal is same as the transmitted signal. It means that no distortion happened by this multipath.\n\nNow let's think of how the received signal is influenced by the multipath with the frequency of the transmitted signal. I created plots for three different frequency (In this case, the amplitude of transmitted signal are same for all frequencies). As you see at plot (8) of each case (w=1,2,5), the amplitude of the total received signal gets different depending on frequency.\n\nNote : This shows the cases of only three different frequencies. Isn't there any way of showing the amplitude of total received signal for all the different frequencies in easier way ? We will look into this shortly.\n\nFollowing is the Octave source code (I think this would work with Matlab as well) for the graphs shown above, try playing the list 'a' and 'tau', get some intuitive understanding on your own.\n\nplot(t,real(exp_iwt)); xlim([0 2]);ylim([-1 1]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[-1 0 1]);\n\nplot(t,imag(exp_iwt)); xlim([0 2]);ylim([-1 1]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[-1 0 1]);\n\nplot(t,real(exp_iwt_sum),'r-'); xlim([0 2]);ylim([-3 3]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[-3 0 3]);\n\nplot(t,imag(exp_iwt_sum),'r-'); xlim([0 2]);ylim([-3 3]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[-3 0 3]);\n\nplot(w,real(Hw)); xlim([0 wmax]);ylim([-1 1]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[-1 0 1]);\n\nplot(w,imag(Hw)); xlim([0 wmax]);ylim([-1 1]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[-1 0 1]);\n\nplot(w,abs(Hw)); xlim([0 wmax]);ylim([0 1]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[0 1]);\n\nplot(w,real(Hw_sum),'r-'); xlim([0 wmax]);ylim([-5 5]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[-5 0 5]);\n\nplot(w,imag(Hw_sum),'r-'); xlim([0 wmax]);ylim([-5 5]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[-5 0 5]);\n\nplot(w,abs(Hw_sum),'r-'); xlim([0 wmax]);ylim([0 5]); set(gca,'xticklabel',[]); set(gca,'ytick',[0 5]);\n\nNow we have a channel described in the form of impulse response. Let's suppose that we have a signal x(t) going through the channel. The x(t) will split into multiple pathes in the channel and take the different route and finally recombine at the receiver antenna. What would the signal at the receiving antenna look like ? There is an excellent mathematical tool to give you the answer to this\nquestion. It is a tool called 'Convolution'. If you just take the convolution of channel impulse response and input signal (x(t)), you would take the signal at the receiving antenna.\n\nWhen we specify a Fading Channel profile, we are usually given a table with tap delay and relative power for each tap. You may visualize the table as shown below. Usually those profile table in the specification does not specify statistical information for the tap, but usually some specific statistical profile is associated with each tap. In case of LTE channel profile (Tap Delay Line : TDL), usually each tap is associated with statistical power profile as shown below. Usually the first tap indicates the fading on line of sight path that is modeled in Rician distribution and the remaining taps indicates the fading channel on non line of sight path that is modeled in Rayleigh distribution.\n\nWhen it comes to using this channel profile in fading implementation, I would take this as the impulse response of the fading channel. Then, the modeling of a signal passing through a fading channel can be represented as the convolution of signal and the fading channel as illustrated below.\n\nSound simple ? Yes simple conceptually, but there is a difficulties in reality. It is about how to apply the statistically property associated with each tap.\n\nEach tap is associated with a specific statistical power and doppler profile. It mean that the power for each tap for each steps of convolution changes and the frequency shift for each tap for each steps of convolution changes according to specific statistical profile as illustrated below.\n\nApplying these changing impulse response, the faded signal is generated as illustrated below. (In real implementation, there are various techniques are used to generate this kind of varing channel impulse response. One widely used mathology is to use Jake's model).\n\nIn addition to this delay, gain, PDF, we have to think about the correlations among all the antenna on transmitter and reciever side as follows.\n\nThese correlation is defined in 3GPP as shown below and this correlation matrix should be applied to the Fading model when we use multiple antenna configuration.\n\nDo you see any difference between the matrix shown above (channel matrix) for 2 x 2 MIMO and the correlation matrix as shown below for 2 x 2 case ?\n\nOne obvious difference is size of the matrix. The channel matrix shown above is 2x2 matrix and the correlation matrix for 2 x 2 case shown below is 4x4.\n\nAny idea on how the 2x2 matrix show above is converted to 4 x 4 matrix shown below ?\n\n(The full correlation matrices is obtained by Tensor Product/Kronecker product\nof two antenna correlation matrix)\n\nLet's start with the simplest case and add piece by piece until we reach more realistic (complex) cases.\n\nLet's suppose that you have two Tx antenna and one Rx antenna. If draw this situation as in channel model, you can draw this setup as follows. (Let's call this a Case A)\n\nIn this setup, you have two channel path(channel coefficient) h1 and h2. Now let's think about all the possible relation between these two channel. If you draw all the possible relationships as a diagram, you may represent as follows.\n\nIf you represent these relationship between the two channel path (channel coefficient) in a matrix format, you can represent it as follows. (I would not explain it in detail but you would need to have some intuitive understanding of vector/matrix. This is why you should have taken such a boring linear algebra course in the university. If you are really new to this vector/matrix concept,\nVector/Matrix page on this site). Be careful, you may get confused with 2 x 2 matrix to be used to model 2 x 2 MIMO channel. (At least I was confused a lot at the beginning. I would not talk too much about it, but I strongly recommend you to compare the two matrix and clearly understand the difference between them). Just to give you the conclusion about the difference between the two matrix, the matrix shown\nhere represents the correlation between each channel path(the path the signal flow through) and the matrix shown in channel model represents the correlation between Tx and Rx antenna.\n\nThe 'Beta' value represents the cross correlation between channel coefficient h1 and h2.\n\nNow we have a different case. In this case, you have two Tx antenna and one Rx antenna. If draw this situation as in channel model, you can draw this setup as follows. (Let's call this a Case B)\n\nIf you represent these relationship between the two channel path (channel coefficient) in a diagram, you can represent it as follows.\n\nIf you represent these relationship between the two channel path (channel coefficient) in a matrix format,, you can represent it as follows.The 'Alpha' value represents the cross correlation between channel coefficient h1 and h2.\n\nNow let's look into more complicated case. In this case, you have two transmitter antenna and two reciever antenna. The antenna and channel path can be illustrated as follows. You can think of this as a combination of Case A and Case B described above.\n\nNow if you represents the correlations between each of these channel coefficients, it can be represented as follows.\n\nAs you did in case A and B, if you represents these correlations in vector/matrix format, you would get a big matrix as follows. How did you get the last matrix ?. Actually it came from the matrix for Case A and B described above. If you clearly understood the meaning of Beta and Alpha in Case A and B, you would easily understand how each of the elements in this big matrix can be represented\nas 'Alpha' or 'Beta'.\n\nwhat about the '?' part shown above ? Filling out these '?' is not so straigtforward. If you brow the statical concept (I cannot explain though :)), those parts are the places where the correlation between part of Case A and part of Case B and can be filled as follows.\n\nHow to derive MIMO coeifficient matrix mathematically from Diversity coefficient matrix ?\n\nI have explained how we got 2x2 MIMO correlation matrix from physical perspective and the each elements of 2 x 2 MIMO matrix can be derived from the elements of 2x1 Diversity matrix. I strongly recommend you to try to get familiar with this concept and build your own intuition. But as the number of antenna increases, deriving all the correlation matrix as I described above would not be that\neasy. Fortunately there is a mathematical way of deriving the MIMO correlation matrix from Diversity Correlation matrix. The MIMO correlation matrix can be derived by taking Kronecker product of two Diversity matrix as shown below. (If you are not familar with the concept of Kronecker product, refer to this page)\n\nThe last component I want to show you about Fading is Doppler spread. Doppler spread is caused by the well known phenomenon called 'Doppler Shift' (I would not explain what Doppler shift is. Everybody would learned about this from High school physics and you can easily google out a lot of explanation of this effect).\n\nDoppler spread can be expressed as shown in following function and plot. If you think of 'Doppler spread' as a kind of filter (or a block in a control system model). You can take the following function as a kind of transfer function of the filter.\n\nAs you see, how much a frequency (fc) get spreaded by doppler spread is indicated by fm. If you see another formula below the graph representing fm, you would see fm is determined by the velocity of object (relative velocify between transmitter and reciever) and speed of light and fc(carrier frequency). You know fc is constant (set by standard and assume hardware is good enough to maintain\nthe fc the same). Now the only variable is the speed v. According to this equation, fm and v are in proportional relation, meaning if v gets higher, fm gets larger (the width of the graph gets wider) and if v gets smaller, fm gets smaller (the width of the graph gets narrower).\n\nHow this kind of plot is obtained ? What is the meaning of this plot. Let's think a little bit further into how we get this plot.\n\nLet's assume that a car (e.g, a phone in a car) is moving in horizontal direction and it is receiving a signal with an angle illustrated as in (A). Since the car is moving, the phone in the car would experience doppler shift. Since the UE is getting the signal with an angle, the doppler shift it percieves can be represented as in red arrow in (B).\n\nNow let's extend this situation further to the situation where the UE in the moving car is receiving the signal from all direction as illustrated below. This is the situation where the UE has so many reflectors around it and recieves the multipath signal all around. Then the doppler shift that UE percieves is like red dots marked on the horizontal line. If you plot those red dots in probability distribution function, you will get the red plot as shown below.\n\nNow you may have question. How differently the narrow Doppler spread and wide doppler spread affect on the signal ?\n\nThe simulation result for these two cases (narrow and wide doppler spread) is shown below. The upper track is for narrow doppler spread and the lower track is for wide doppler spread. As you see, you see much frequency energy fluctuation over time in wide Doppler spectrum. I will update the page later about the mathmatical background.\n\nIf you are using a phone in high speed train, the distance between UE and eNB changes very fast. It means both UE and eNB will be under drastic doppler shift.\n\nFor example, let's suppose the train is traveling right into the eNB as illustrated below (the eNB is right on top of the railway). Of course, you don't see this kind of situation in real life. The train will crash into the eNB in this case. However, just suppose this is possible and train can go through a ghost-like eNB. In this case and assume that the speed of the train is constant, the doppler shift will stay constant as well. The only change is the direction of frequency shift changes as the train pass through eNB as illustrated below.\n\nHowever, in realy you don't see any case shown above in real life. In real life, the eNB is located away from the rail way at certain distance.\n\nIn this case, the Doppler Shift changes as the train get closer to, pass by and farther away from the eNB. The doppler shift at a specific time is represented as shown below (36.101 B.3)\n\nWhere does this equation come from ? It turned out to be from hunior high school geometry, but it took me long time to understand this since there is no background information in 3GPP.\n\nThis model is based on the assumption that the eNBs are spaced equaly and the train moves at a constant speed. It is also assumed that the initial location of the train (the location at t = 0) on the railway is at the mid point between two adjacent eNBs as shown below. Dmin is defined as the closest possible distance between UE and eNB and the initial location is specified to be half way between two adjacent eNBs. Then, the distance between the eNB and the train can be derived. If we define the angle theta as shown below, the cos(theta) will become as below.\n\nNow let's look into a snapshot after t seconds. Now the location of the train on the railway and the distance between UE and eNB, and the cos(theta) is derived as shown below. (Just try to derive on your own or just copy it with a pen on a paper, you will understand it clearly).\n\nIf you plot the doppler shift with time as traing travel along the railway, it would be illustrated as shown below.\n\nFollowing is the Matlab code that I wrote based on the equation shown above. In this, I calculated not only frequency shift but also the angle(theta) to figure out the location of the train more easily.\n\nNow let's do some experiment with the code to understand the impact of the parameters. The first experiment is to change the speed of the train keeping all other parameters same. The doppler shift that UE (on the train) will experience can be plotted as shown below. See if this is aligned with your intuitive understanding.\n\nNow let's do another experiement. In this experiement, I changed Dmin keeping all other parameters same. The doppler shift that UE (on the train) will experience can be plotted as shown below. See if this is aligned with your intuitive understanding.\n\nTypical model for Fading channel can be described by a simple diagram as follows. This is very simplified model but fortunately this is almost enough for 3GPP specification for fading test. As you see, a signal comes into the fading block and splits into multiple path. Each path has three components, namely Delay, PDF, Gain component. By changing these parameters in each path,\nyou can construct pretty complicated fading channel.\n\nIn LTE 3GPP specification, typical three types of Fading profiles are defined as follows.\n\nGo through following pages (examples) and try to get some intuitive understanding on your own.\n\n[2] Rayleigh Fading Channels in Mobile Digital Communication Systems.

Detailed explanation of these procedures can be found in 3GPP TS 48.008 and 3GPP TS 24.008.\nThere are three types of GSM handover that involve a single BSS and a single MSC. These are \"Internal Handover\", \"BSS Internal Handover with MSC Support\"  and\" External Handover\".\nAn \"Internal Handover\" takes place between channels on a cell or cells controlled by a single BSS, without reference to the MSC, although the MSC maybe informed of its occurrence after completion. This typical case can be used by the BSS e.g. if the A-Interface User Plane is not to be modified. This \"Internal Handover\" may take place with AoTDM or with AoIP and is not considered in the present document.\nA \"BSS Internal Handover with MSC Support\" shall only be used if AoIP is supported by both MSC and BSS and if the A-Interface User Plane has to be modified. In that case the BSS or the MSC may initiate a \"BSS Internal Handover with MSC Support\" procedure as described in detail in subclause 6.3 in this document.\n\nHandovers between channels on the same cell or between cells on the same BSS which are controlled by the MSC (as defined prior to the introduction of AoIP) are termed \"External Handovers\" and use identical procedures to those for Inter-BSS-Intra-MSC handovers.  \"External Handovers\" are also specified with AoIP User Plane transport, for example the handover from speech to data services.Handovers from a BSS to an RNS controlled by the same 3G_MSC are intra-3G_MSC GSM to UMTS handovers. Handovers from an RNS to a BSS controlled by the same 3G_MSC are intra-3G_MSC UMTS to GSM handovers.\nThere are two types of handover in UMTS: soft handover and hard handover. The first one is fully performed within UTRAN, without involving the core network. The second one may be also performed within UTRAN or GERAN, or between GERAN and UTRAN, or the core network may be involved if the Iur or Iur-g interface between RNSs does not exist. This case of hard handover involving the core network is covered in the present document, together with SRNS relocation with Iur or Iur-g interface.",

The location information for each MS is stored in functional units called location registers. Functionally, there are two types of location registers:\nSee also 3GPP TS 23.002 where the network architecture is described, and 3GPP TS 23.008 where the data stored in the location registers are described.\nThe action taken by a MS in order to provide location information to the PLMN will be referred to as location updating.\n2.2\tLocation area and MSC area\nThe MSC area is composed of the area covered by all base stations controlled by the MSC. An MSC area may consist of several location areas. A location area is an area in which, after having performed a location update once, MSs may roam without being required to perform subsequent location updates for reason of location change. A location area consists of one or more cells.\n\nFor further details of the network architecture, see 3GPP TS 23.002.\n2.3\tLocation area identification\nThe Location Area Identification (LAI) plan is part of the base station identification plan. The base stations are identified uniquely (see 3GPP TS 23.003).\n2.4\tIMSI detach/attach operation\nThe support of IMSI detach/attach operation is mandatory in MSs. The facility is optional in the fixed infrastructure of the PLMN.\n2.4.1\tExplicit IMSI detach/attach\nExplicit IMSI detach operation is the action taken by an MS to indicate to the PLMN that the station has entered an inactive state (e.g. the station is powered down). Explicit IMSI attach operation is the action taken by an MS to indicate that the station has re-entered an active state (e.g. the station is powered up).\n2.4.2\tImplicit IMSI detach\n\nImplicit IMSI detach operation is the action taken by the VLR to mark an MS as detached when there has been no successful contact between the MS and the network for a time determined by the implicit detach timer. The value of the implicit detach timer is derived from the periodic location updating timer; when the MSC/VLR applies Mobility Management Congestion Control to a MS, the MSC/VLR may need to adjust the Implicit Detach timer as specified in clause 3.7.2. During an established radio contact, the implicit detach timer shall be prevented from triggering implicit detach. At the release of the radio connection, the implicit detach timer shall be reset and restarted. Implicit IMSI detach shall also be performed in the case of a negative response to an IMEI check.\n2.5\tUse of the term mobile station (MS) in the present document\n\nIn order to simplify the text the term Mobile Station (MS) as used in relation to location management refers to the entity where the IMSI is stored, i.e., in card operated MSs the term Mobile Station (MS) refers to the card.\n2.6\tPaging area\nAs an option, and for paging optimization purpose, the VLR may control Paging Areas. A Paging Area (PgA) is composed of up to 5 Location Areas, and the MSC area is composed of several Paging Areas. Paging areas may overlap each other. The Paging Area is stored in the HLR and updated at each paging area change. The Paging Area is sent by the HLR to the VLR at roaming number request and may be used by the MSC/VLR for paging (e.g. when LAI is not known, after MSC/VLR restart) (see 3GPP TS 23.018 [5a]).",

Simultaneous use of STTD and closed loop modes on the same physical channel is not allowed. In addition, if Tx diversity is applied on any of the downlink physical channels allocated to a UE(s) that is configured to use P-CPICH as a phase reference on both antennas, then Tx diversity shall also be applied on P-CCPCH and SCH. If Tx diversity is applied on SCH it shall also be applied on P-CCPCH and vice versa. Regarding CPICH transmission in case of transmit diversity used on SCH and P-CCPCH, see subclause 5.3.3.1. An S-CCPCH carrying BCH shall be transmitted with the same diversity mode as P-CCPCH.\n\nWith respect to the usage of Tx diversity for DPCH or F-DPCH on different radio links within an active set, the following rules apply:\n\nFurthermore, if the UE is not configured in MIMO mode and in MIMO mode with four transmit antennas in a cell the following restrictions apply in this cell:\n\nIf the UE is configured in MIMO mode in a cell then a DPCH or F-DPCH associated with an HS-PDSCH subframe can be either in transmit diversity mode or in no transmit diversity mode in this cell.\n\nRegardless of whether or not the UE is configured in MIMO mode or in MIMO mode with four transmit antennas in a cell,\n\nThe transmit diversity mode on the associated DPCH or F-DPCH may not change during a HS-SCCH and or HS-PDSCH subframe and within the slot prior to the HS-SCCH subframe. This includes any change between no Tx diversity and either open loop or closed loop mode.\n\nIf the UE is receiving a DPCH on which transmit diversity is used from a cell, or if the UE is receiving an F-DPCH for which STTD is signalled from a cell, the UE shall assume that the E-AGCH, E-ROCH, E-RGCH, E-HICH, and F-TPICH from the same cell are transmitted using STTD.\n\nIf DPCCH2 is configured and if the UE is receiving both DPCH and F-DPCH from a cell, then the UE shall assume that the E-AGCH, E-ROCH, E-RGCH, E-HICH, and F-TPICH from the same cell are transmitted using the transmit diversity mode signalled for the F-DPCH.",

There may be zero, one, or several uplink DPDCHs on each radio link.\n\nThe uplink DPCCH is used to carry control information generated at Layer 1. The Layer 1 control information consists of known pilot bits to support channel estimation for coherent detection, transmit power-control (TPC) commands, feedback information (FBI), and an optional transport-format combination indicator (TFCI). The transport-format combination indicator informs the receiver about the instantaneous transport format combination of the transport channels mapped to the simultaneously transmitted uplink DPDCH radio frame. There is one and only one uplink DPCCH on each radio link. The uplink DPCCH may also carry DL FET ACK/NACK signalling information for DL FET operation when DL_DCH_FET_Config = 1.\n\nThe uplink DPCCH2 is used to carry control information generated at Layer 1. The Layer 1 control information consists of known pilot bits to support channel estimation for coherent detection, and transmit power-control (TPC) commands. When DPCCH2 is configured there is one and only one uplink DPCCH2 for all radio links. When DPCCH2 is configured, the UE shall transmit DPCCH2 only in the slots in which DPCCH is transmitted.\n\nThe uplink S-DPCCH is used to carry control information generated at Layer 1. The Layer 1 control information consists of known pilot bits to support channel sounding and channel estimation for coherent detection. There is up to one uplink S-DPCCH on each radio link in the case that UL_CLTD_Enabled as defined in [5] is TRUE. Figure 1 shows the frame structure of the uplink DPDCH, the uplink DPCCH, the uplink DPCCH2 and the uplink S-DPCCH. Each radio frame of length 10 ms is split into 5 subframes, each of 3 slots, each of length Tslot = 2560 chips, corresponding to one power-control period. The DPDCH, DPCCH, S-DPCCH and DPCCH2 are always frame aligned with each other.\n\nThe parameter k in figure 1 determines the number of bits per uplink DPDCH slot. It is related to the spreading factor SF of the DPDCH as SF = 256/2k. The DPDCH spreading factor may range from 256 down to 4. The spreading factor of the uplink DPCCH, the uplink DPCCH2 and the uplink S-DPCCH is always equal to 256, i.e. there are 10 bits per uplink DPCCH/S-DPCCH/DPCCH2 slot.\n\nThe exact number of bits of the uplink DPDCH and the different uplink DPCCH fields (Npilot, NTFCI, NFBI, and NTPC) is given by table 1 and table 2. What slot format to use is configured by higher layers and can also be reconfigured by higher layers. The exact number of bits of the uplink S-DPCCH is given by table 2A.\n\nThe uplink DPCCH2 reuses slot format #1 of DPCCH, and the exact number of bits is given in table 2.\n\nThe channel bit and symbol rates given in table 1, table 2 and table 2A are the rates immediately before spreading. The pilot patterns are given in table 3 and table 4, the TPC bit pattern is given in table 5.\n\nThe FBI bits are used to support techniques requiring feedback from the UE to the UTRAN Access Point for operation of closed loop mode transmit diversity. The use of the FBI bits is described in detail in [5].\n\nThere are two types of uplink dedicated physical channels; those that include TFCI (e.g. for several simultaneous services) and those that do not include TFCI (e.g. for fixed-rate services). These types are reflected by the duplicated rows of table 2. It is the UTRAN that determines if a TFCI should be transmitted and it is mandatory for all UEs to support the use of TFCI in the uplink. The mapping of TFCI bits onto slots is described in [3].\n\nDPCCH slot format 5 is used when DL_DCH_FET_Config is configured by higher layers. In this case, over a 20ms Compression Interval (CI) consisting of 30 slots, the bits in the TFCI field carry TFCI information in the first 10 slots, and may carry an ACK/NACK indicator for DL FET in the remaining 20 slots. The ACK/NACK for DL FET is sent when DL_DCH_FET_Config = 1.\n\nIn compressed mode, DPCCH slot formats with TFCI fields are changed. There are two possible compressed slot formats for normal slot formats 0 and 2. They are labelled A and B and the selection between them is dependent on the number of slots that are transmitted in each frame in compressed mode. When DL_DCH_FET_Config is configured by higher layers, UL DPCCH slot format 5 is used in compressed mode. In compressed mode when UL_DCH_FET_Config is configured by higher layers, TFCI bits represent TFCI information in the first 10 slots that are not in compressed-mode gaps in a 20ms CI. The TFCI bits in subsequent slots that are not in the compressed mode gaps represent ACK/NACK indication for DL FET when DL_DCH_FET_Config = 1.\n\nIf UL_DTX_Active is TRUE (see [5]), the number of transmitted slots per radio frame may be less than the number shown in Table 2 and Table 2A.\n\nThe pilot bit pattern for S-DPCCH is the same as that for uplink DPCCH with Npilot = 8. The Nfixed bits in the S-DPCCH are fixed to \"10\".\n\nThe pilot bit pattern for DPCCH2 is the same as that for uplink DPCCH with Npilot = 8.\n\nThe pilot bit patterns are described in table 3 and table 4. The shadowed column part of pilot bit pattern is defined as FSW and FSWs can be used to confirm frame synchronization. (The value of the pilot bit pattern other than FSWs shall be \"1\".)\n\nThe relationship between the TPC bit pattern and transmitter power control command is presented in table 5.\n\nMulti-code operation is possible for the uplink dedicated physical channels. When multi-code transmission is used, several parallel DPDCH are transmitted using different channelization codes, see [4]. However, there is only one DPCCH per radio link, one DPCCH2 if DPCCH2 is configured and up to one S-DPCCH in the case that UL_CLTD_Enable is TRUE.\n\nA period of uplink DPCCH transmission prior to the start of the uplink DPDCH transmission (uplink DPCCH power control preamble) shall be used for initialisation of a DCH. The length of the power control preamble is a higher layer parameter, Npcp , signalled by the network [5]. The UL DPCCH shall take the same slot format in the power control preamble as afterwards, as given in table 2. When Npcp > 0 the pilot patterns of table 3 and table 4 shall be used. The timing of the power control preamble is described in [5], subclause 4.3.2.3. The TFCI field is filled with \"0\" bits.",

What confuse you would about 'how one technology differs from other technologies ?' or 'which technology I have to chose for my application or use model ?'\n\nThe simple answer to the question \"Which technology do I have to pick for my application or my use model ?\" is \"It depends on the nature of your application\".\n\nI know.. you would not take this as an answer. You would ask for more specific answers.\n\nIf you want to get more specific answers, you would have specific answers to a lot of specific questions as listed below. (This list would get extended as learn/observe more from various discussions/forums).\n\nI would not put my comments on each of the questions for now.. just to give you some time for you to think.. (good excuse for my laziness :)).\n\nThis is basically asking about the data rate of the end node in your IoT system. Is it collecting a simple data like Temperature, Humidity which takes up only several bytes at a time of transmission. Normally this kind of IoT device should be very low cost. It is less likely to let this kind of device to use relatively expensive network (like cellular network).\n\nThis is asking 'Are you going to use a simple sensors (like temperature, humidity) ?' or some other devices which requires a relatively large packet transmission/reception or which requires very high level data security.\n\nThis would be highly related to Q1. Usually the type of data to be collected and transmitted would determine the necessary data rate, but there might be some exceptions. For example, if you need very sophisticated data security and add a lot of additional portions to the original data to implement the security, the data rate that you would need would get much higher. Another exception can be the case where you want to upgrade/reconfigure your end-node remotely. Of course, this would not happen very often but if you really want to do this, the data rate should be pretty high for the end-node to download necessary firmware and configuration information.\n\nQ4. Does your end node device will both transmit and receive data ? or only transmit the data (no recieve) ?\n\nMost of the IoT application is Uplink centeric (transmission only in terms of end-device) and in some extreme case there are some application that is uplink only. It is understandable for most of IoT application to be Uplink dominant but there would be a lot of restriction if it goes with uplink only. For example, you have a very simple end-device (e.g, a temperature sensor) and transmitted it to a Gateway or Basestation. If the device is uplink only (transmission only), the device can only transmit the data and there is no way to verify whther it successfully reached the destination or not. To verify the successful transmission of the data, there should be some mechanism by which the destination (e.g, Gateway) can send Acknowledge message to the device that has sent the data. To do this, the system should allow downlink (i.e, reception in terms of end-device). Also, if you want to apply any form of data security or remote re-configuration or remote update, you need both uplink and downlink.\n\nLet me ask another question before this .. Are you going to use unlicensed band/frequency (i.e ISM band) or a licensed band / frequency (e.g, Cellular) ? If you decided to use ISM band, it is highly likely to use sub Ghz band (i.e, around 900 Mhz) or around 2.4 Ghz frequency. If you decided to use licensed band, it will be determined by which frequency will be allowed in the area where your IoT system will be installed.\n\nIf you selected unlicensed band, you are free to use any of the frequency .. but it is not only you who is free to use the frequency.. there might be a lot of other devices that uses the same frequency which might cause unwanted interference. If you decided to use the licensed frequency, there will be licensing / permission issue.\n\nIf the transmitter and reciever is communicating within the range of couple of meters or tens of meters, you can use many of the existing short range communication like Bluetooth, ZigBee etc. However, if it should extend to several km or tens of km, you have to use those technologies that can cover wide range like LPWAN (e.g, LoRa, SigFox etc) or Cellular technology.\n\nBasically IoT requires a cirtain type of Network structure whether it is small or large (in most case it is not peer to peer communication). Then you would have question on how to form such a network and how much control you want to have over the whole network. Some people would say 'I want to implement only the end Node(e.g, terminal sensor module) and get it connected to an exisiting network that are already established'. In this case, you would consider Cellular based IoT or SigFox. In this option, you would have less work to do but very limitted or no controllability for network. Some people would say 'I want to implement everything from the end node to the network and I want to have full control over the network'. In this case, you may like LoRa type of technology. You would have full controllability, but downside is that there are a lot of works for you to do.\n\nFor example, SKT deployed a Nation wide IoT service in South Korea around the end of 2016 based on LoRa technology. According to Ref [5], they were considering LoRa, SigFox, NB-LTE(and other LTE based IoT). LTE IoT was excluded for other reason, but between LoRa and SigFox, the controllability to Network was one of the factor to select LoRa.\n\nQ10. Do you need any security for the data being transmitted and received ? At which level, if you need ?\n\nI personally think this is pretty important issue since there are many cases where it is not easy to change / upgrade the software of a IoT end node once it is installed or take too much cost to visit every installation points and change software of the device. However, I don't see this issues widely discussed in the industry yet (as of early 2017). Probably they are afraid to bring up the issues that does not have any simple / easy solution. In theory, the smartest solution is to let the end node device itself to download the new software and upgrade it by itself. We have seen this type of software upgrade in cellular phone (smart phone) pretty commonly these days. We may think of utilizing the similar technologies to IoT devices. However, the biggest problem would be the bandwidth. Most of IoT device is designed for low data rate communication, but this kind of wireless software upgrade would take pretty big bandwidth. So if you think of this kind of wireless software upgrade, you would need to choose such a technology to provide big enough bandwidth for wireless woftware upgrade.\n\nQ12. What kind of protocol (phy, mac, application layer protocol) do you want to use ?\n\nThere are many different technologies that claim to be the best for IoT. Some of them would already be available at your time of deployment, but some technologies would be being talked a lot but not available or not mature yet. So if your deployment schedule is very near, you would need to choose a technology that are mature right now.\n\nFor example, SKT deployed a Nation wide IoT service in South Korea around the end of 2016 based on LoRa technology. According to Ref [5], they were considering LoRa, SigFox, NB-LTE(and other LTE based IoT). SigFox were excluded for other reason, but between LoRa and SigFox, LoRa was selected mainly due to availability. LoRa technology was already there when they were planning, but there were still a couple of years to go for LTE based IoT to be mature enough.\n\n[3] NarrowBand IoT Demystified: What are the benefits and why do we need it?

(This applies also for dual connectivity using E-UTRAN access.)\n\nAs mentioned in the summary for INOBEARRAN, the maximum number of EPS bearers has previously been limited to 8 since Rel-8 but it has become apparent that more than 8 radio bearers are needed to simultaneously support all the services that operators have been introducing. TSG SA agreed to work on a Rel-15 Work Item [1], which is a counterpart of INOBEARRAN, to ensure that 15 EPS bearers can be supported by the core network.\n\nE-UTRAN idle mode mobility and handover procedures are updated to support the additional EPS bearers. In networks that are only partly upgraded, mobility procedures to target nodes that do not support 15 EPS bearers result in bearers being released based on existing error handling procedures. Bearers will also be released if a UE that supports 15 bearers moves to UTRAN or GERAN, as GPRS core network and Radio Access networks do not support 15 PDP contexts.\n\nTo minimize the impact of releasing bearers as a result of mobility to non-supporting target nodes the MME should be able to allocate EPS bearer IDs in such way that the bearers with higher operator preference will be preserved in case of mobility involving legacy target nodes.\n\nIt is necessary for all PDN GWs in a PLMN to support 15 EPS bearers, and MME's can be configured to take into account whether the HPLMN supports 15 EPS bearers when selecting a PDN GW for a supporting UE. Inter-PLMN handover is also based on MME configuration.",

There may be zero, one, or several uplink DPDCHs on each radio link.\n\nThe uplink DPCCH is used to carry control information generated at Layer 1. The Layer 1 control information consists of known pilot bits to support channel estimation for coherent detection, transmit power-control (TPC) commands, feedback information (FBI), and an optional transport-format combination indicator (TFCI). The transport-format combination indicator informs the receiver about the instantaneous transport format combination of the transport channels mapped to the simultaneously transmitted uplink DPDCH radio frame. There is one and only one uplink DPCCH on each radio link. The uplink DPCCH may also carry DL FET ACK/NACK signalling information for DL FET operation when DL_DCH_FET_Config = 1.\n\nThe uplink DPCCH2 is used to carry control information generated at Layer 1. The Layer 1 control information consists of known pilot bits to support channel estimation for coherent detection, and transmit power-control (TPC) commands. When DPCCH2 is configured there is one and only one uplink DPCCH2 for all radio links. When DPCCH2 is configured, the UE shall transmit DPCCH2 only in the slots in which DPCCH is transmitted.\n\nThe uplink S-DPCCH is used to carry control information generated at Layer 1. The Layer 1 control information consists of known pilot bits to support channel sounding and channel estimation for coherent detection. There is up to one uplink S-DPCCH on each radio link in the case that UL_CLTD_Enabled as defined in [5] is TRUE. Figure 1 shows the frame structure of the uplink DPDCH, the uplink DPCCH, the uplink DPCCH2 and the uplink S-DPCCH. Each radio frame of length 10 ms is split into 5 subframes, each of 3 slots, each of length Tslot = 2560 chips, corresponding to one power-control period. The DPDCH, DPCCH, S-DPCCH and DPCCH2 are always frame aligned with each other.\n\nThe parameter k in figure 1 determines the number of bits per uplink DPDCH slot. It is related to the spreading factor SF of the DPDCH as SF = 256/2k. The DPDCH spreading factor may range from 256 down to 4. The spreading factor of the uplink DPCCH, the uplink DPCCH2 and the uplink S-DPCCH is always equal to 256, i.e. there are 10 bits per uplink DPCCH/S-DPCCH/DPCCH2 slot.\n\nThe exact number of bits of the uplink DPDCH and the different uplink DPCCH fields (Npilot, NTFCI, NFBI, and NTPC) is given by table 1 and table 2. What slot format to use is configured by higher layers and can also be reconfigured by higher layers. The exact number of bits of the uplink S-DPCCH is given by table 2A.\n\nThe uplink DPCCH2 reuses slot format #1 of DPCCH, and the exact number of bits is given in table 2.\n\nThe channel bit and symbol rates given in table 1, table 2 and table 2A are the rates immediately before spreading. The pilot patterns are given in table 3 and table 4, the TPC bit pattern is given in table 5.\n\nThe FBI bits are used to support techniques requiring feedback from the UE to the UTRAN Access Point for operation of closed loop mode transmit diversity. The use of the FBI bits is described in detail in [5].\n\nThere are two types of uplink dedicated physical channels; those that include TFCI (e.g. for several simultaneous services) and those that do not include TFCI (e.g. for fixed-rate services). These types are reflected by the duplicated rows of table 2. It is the UTRAN that determines if a TFCI should be transmitted and it is mandatory for all UEs to support the use of TFCI in the uplink. The mapping of TFCI bits onto slots is described in [3].\n\nDPCCH slot format 5 is used when DL_DCH_FET_Config is configured by higher layers. In this case, over a 20ms Compression Interval (CI) consisting of 30 slots, the bits in the TFCI field carry TFCI information in the first 10 slots, and may carry an ACK/NACK indicator for DL FET in the remaining 20 slots. The ACK/NACK for DL FET is sent when DL_DCH_FET_Config = 1.\n\nIn compressed mode, DPCCH slot formats with TFCI fields are changed. There are two possible compressed slot formats for normal slot formats 0 and 2. They are labelled A and B and the selection between them is dependent on the number of slots that are transmitted in each frame in compressed mode. When DL_DCH_FET_Config is configured by higher layers, UL DPCCH slot format 5 is used in compressed mode. In compressed mode when UL_DCH_FET_Config is configured by higher layers, TFCI bits represent TFCI information in the first 10 slots that are not in compressed-mode gaps in a 20ms CI. The TFCI bits in subsequent slots that are not in the compressed mode gaps represent ACK/NACK indication for DL FET when DL_DCH_FET_Config = 1.\n\nIf UL_DTX_Active is TRUE (see [5]), the number of transmitted slots per radio frame may be less than the number shown in Table 2 and Table 2A.\n\nThe pilot bit pattern for S-DPCCH is the same as that for uplink DPCCH with Npilot = 8. The Nfixed bits in the S-DPCCH are fixed to \"10\".\n\nThe pilot bit pattern for DPCCH2 is the same as that for uplink DPCCH with Npilot = 8.\n\nThe pilot bit patterns are described in table 3 and table 4. The shadowed column part of pilot bit pattern is defined as FSW and FSWs can be used to confirm frame synchronization. (The value of the pilot bit pattern other than FSWs shall be \"1\".)\n\nThe relationship between the TPC bit pattern and transmitter power control command is presented in table 5.\n\nMulti-code operation is possible for the uplink dedicated physical channels. When multi-code transmission is used, several parallel DPDCH are transmitted using different channelization codes, see [4]. However, there is only one DPCCH per radio link, one DPCCH2 if DPCCH2 is configured and up to one S-DPCCH in the case that UL_CLTD_Enable is TRUE.\n\nA period of uplink DPCCH transmission prior to the start of the uplink DPDCH transmission (uplink DPCCH power control preamble) shall be used for initialisation of a DCH. The length of the power control preamble is a higher layer parameter, Npcp , signalled by the network [5]. The UL DPCCH shall take the same slot format in the power control preamble as afterwards, as given in table 2. When Npcp > 0 the pilot patterns of table 3 and table 4 shall be used. The timing of the power control preamble is described in [5], subclause 4.3.2.3. The TFCI field is filled with \"0\" bits.",

The base requirement was to provide at least the same security features as LTE.\n\nNon-Standalone NR Security\n\nThe NSA architecture uses LTE as the master radio access technology, while the new radio access technology (i.e. NR) serves as secondary radio access technology with User Equipment's (UEs) connected to both radios. Except for capability negotiation, security procedures for EN-DC basically follow the specifications for dual connectivity security for LTE. The WI summary for EDCE5 security (cf. corresponding clause above) provides details.\n\nEvolution of the trust model\n\nMoving on from the Non-Standalone deployment, in a Standalone 5G system, the trust model has evolved. Trust within the network is considered as decreasing the further one moves from the core. This has impact on decisions taken in 5G security design, thus we present the trust model in this section.\n\nThe trust model in the UE is reasonably simple: there are two trust domains, the tamper proof UICC on which the Universal Subscriber Identity Module (USIM) resides as trust anchor and the Mobile Equipment (ME). The ME and the USIM together form the UE.\n\nThe network side trust model for roaming and non-roaming cases are shown in the two following figures respectively, which shows the trust in multiple layers, like in an onion.\n\nThe Radio Access Network (RAN) is separated into distributed units (DU, or gNB-DU) and central units (CU, or gNB-CU) - DU and CU together form the gNB, as seen above. The DU does not have any access to customer communications as it may be deployed in unsupervised sites. The CU and Non-3GPP Inter Working Function (N3IWF - not shown in the figures), which terminates the Access Stratum (AS) security, will be deployed in sites with more restricted access.\n\nIn the Core Network, the Access Management Function (AMF) serves as termination point for Non-Access Stratum (NAS) security. Currently, i.e. in the 3GPP 5G Phase 1 specification, the AMF is collocated with the SEcurity Anchor Function (SEAF) that holds the root key (known as anchor key) for the visited network. The security architecture is defined in a future proof fashion, as it allows separation of the security anchor from the mobility function that could be possible in a future evolution of the system architecture.\n\nThe AUthentication Function (AUSF) keeps a key for reuse, derived after authentication, in case of simultaneous registration of a UE in different access network technologies, i.e. 3GPP access networks and non-3GPP access networks such as IEEE 802.11 Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN). Authentication credential Repository and Processing Function (ARPF) keeps the authentication credentials. This is mirrored by the USIM on the side of the client, i.e. the UE side. The subscriber information is stored in the Unified Data Repository (UDR). The Unified Data Management (UDM) uses the subscription data stored in UDR and implements the application logic to perform various functionalities such as authentication credential generation, user identification, service and session continuity etc. Over the air interface, both active and passive attacks are considered on both control plane and user plane. Privacy has become increasingly important leading to permanent identifiers being kept secret over the air interface.\n\nIn the roaming architecture, the home and the visited network are connected through SEcurity Protection Proxy (SEPP) for the control plane of the internetwork interconnect. This enhancement is done in 5G because of the number of attacks coming to light recently such as key theft and re-routing attacks in SS7 and network node impersonation and source address spoofing in signalling messages in DIAMETER that exploited the trusted nature of the internetwork interconnect.\n\n5G Phase 1 Security (Release 15)\n\n5G Phase 1 brings several enhancements to LTE security, some of the key points are presented in this section. Details of 5G Phase 1 security can be found in TS 33.501 [1].\n\nPrimary authentication: Network and device mutual authentication in 5G is based on primary authentication. This is similar to LTE but there are a few differences. The authentication mechanism has in-built home control allowing the home operator to know whether the device is authenticated in a given network and to take final call of authentication. In 5G Phase 1 there are two mandatory authentication options: 5G Authentication and Key Agreement (5G-AKA) and Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)-AKA', i.e. EAP-AKA'. Optionally, other EAP based authentication mechanisms are also allowed in 5G - for specific cases such as private networks. Also, primary authentication is radio access technology independent, thus it can run over non-3GPP technology such as IEEE 802.11 WLANs.\n\nSecondary authentication: Secondary authentication in 5G is meant for authentication with data networks outside the mobile operator domain. For this purpose, different EAP based authentication methods and associated credentials can be used. A similar service was possible in LTE as well, but now it is integrated in the 5G architecture.\n\nInter-operator security: Several security issues exist in the inter-operator interface arising from SS7 or Diameter [5,6] in the earlier generations of mobile communication systems. To counter these issues, 5G Phase 1 provides inter-operator security from the very beginning.\n\nPrivacy: Subscriber identity related issues have been known since LTE and earlier generations of mobile systems. In 5G a privacy solution is developed that protects the user's subscription permanent identifier against active attacks. A home network public key is used to provide subscriber identity privacy.\n\nService based architecture (SBA): The 5G core network is based on a service based architecture, which did not exist in LTE and earlier generations. Thus 5G also provides adequate security for SBA.\n\nCentral Unit (CU) - Distributed Unit (DU): In 5G the base-station is logically split in CU and DU with an interface (the F1) between them. Security is provided for the CU-DU interface. This split was also possible in LTE, but in 5G it is part of the architecture that can support a number of deployment options (e.g. co-located CU-DU deployment is also possible). The DUs, which are deployed at the very edge of the network, don't have access to any user data when confidentiality protection is enabled. Even with the CU-DU split, the air interface security point in 5G remains the same as in LTE, namely in the radio access network.\n\nKey hierarchy: The 5G hierarchy reflects the changes in the overall architecture and the trust model using the security principle of key separation. One main difference in 5G compared to LTE is the possibility for integrity protection of the user plane.\n\nMobility: Although mobility in 5G is similar to LTE, the difference in 5G is the assumption that the mobility anchor in the core network can be separated from the security anchor.\n\nReferences",

This service component controls the transfer of the trace records from the NEFs to the OSF. The conceptual model is illustrated in figure 5, which employs both the event report function (CCITT X.734 [14]) and the log control function (CCITT X.735 [15]).\n\nThe trace control function collects traceable events within the NEF and formats them into trace records. These trace records may be stored locally within the NEF filestore or transferred to the OSF in the form of event reports. This is controlled by means of the \"priority\" indicator, which is a part of the trace type. If the \"priority\" indicator is not set then the trace records shall stored within the local filestore and subsequently transferred to the OSF in bulk via FTAM.\n\nIf a trace is activated with the \"priority\" indicator set then the trace records shall be sent to the OSF either direct by the trace control function or through Event Forwarding Discriminators (EFDs).\n\nIf EFDs are used then all trace records are offered to the EFDs. The EFDs determine which of the records are to be transmitted to the OSF in the form of event reports and the Operation System Id field in the header is ignored. The EDFs have complex filter constructs, which allow the operator to define the criteria for destinations and filters.\n\nIf EFDs are not used then all priority records are forwarded to the OSF whose address is given in the Operation System Id field. The NEF is required to supply additional information to provide the OS management application entity title.\n\nFinally, the trace records may also be stored in the form of log entries within the log of the NEF. It is up to the operator to decide if the log function is needed in parallel with the event reporting and file store. Once stored, the log records may be individually accessed by the OSF via the appropriate object management functions. Care should be taken of filter criteria for log records to avoid unnecessary overheads.\n\nThis service component contains the following groups of TMN management functions:\n\n9.2\tTransfer of Records\n\n9.2.1\tBulk record transfer\n\nThis group of TMN functions is concerned with the bulk transfer of trace records from the NEF record filestore to the OSF.\n\nThe trace records shall be transferred from the NEF to the OSF by the use of FTAM services. For further details of the use of FTAM see GSM 12.01 [8].\n\nIn addition to the simple file transfer services provided by FTAM, peertopeer application process communication may also be supported. The use of CMIS services for the uploading of files from the NEF to the OSF is specified in the GSM 12.00 [7].\n\nWhen the procedure defined in GSM 12.00 [7] and GSM 12.01 [8] are used to transfer the trace records, the file type shall be traceRecords and the format of the file is given by the type TraceFileFormat.\n\n9.2.2\tLog control\n\nThis function permits the trace record to be stored and retrieved from logs within the NEF. The logging of these records is performed in accordance with the log control function specified in CCITT X.735 [15] and no additional management functions are required.\n\n9.2.3\tLog access\n\nThis TMN function controls the access to the log described above. Each log defined may contain one or more log entries. Each log entry contains a single trace record.\n\nFor further details concerning the use of logs, see CCITT X.735 [15].\n\nThe following system management functions are required:\n\n9.2.4\tEvent Reporting\n\n9.2.4.1\tEvent Forwarding Discriminators\n\nFor shortterm recording of tracing events and for more complicated filter conditions the event forwarding discriminator construct defined in CCITT X.734 [14] and CCITT X.721 [13] can be employed. The event forwarding discriminator construct is extremely flexible permitting the combination of a number of fields and logical operations with a wide variety of scheduling options. The EFD also controls the destinations to which the event reports are sent. Several such filters may be defined and scheduled for operation at different times and for different time periods.\n\nThe following system management functions are required:\n\n9.2.4.2\tDirect Transfer by Trace Control Function\n\nThis function permits the NEF to transmit trace records direct to the OSF. In general the trace record shall be sent on completion of the call or the traceable event. This function is controlled by means of the \"priority\" indicator, which is contained in the trace type. If the priority indicator is not set, then the trace records shall be stored on file within the NE filestore. These records may be subsequently collected via bulk record transfer as described in subclause 9.2.1. If the trace type specified on activation includes the \"priority\" indicator then all of the records shall be sent via trace reports to the OSF specified by the operation system id.\n\nThe following system management functions are required:",

Release 8 was frozen in December 2008 and this has been the basis for the first wave of LTE equipment. LTE specifications are very stable, with the added benefit of enhancements having been introduced in all subsequent 3GPP Releases.\n\nLTE (Long Term Evolution) or the E-UTRAN (Evolved Universal Terrestrial Access Network), introduced in 3GPP R8, is the access part of the Evolved Packet System (EPS). The main requirements for the new access network are high spectral efficiency, high peak data rates, short round trip time as well as flexibility in frequency and bandwidth.\n\nGSM was developed to carry real time services, in a circuit switched manner (blue in figure 1), with data services only possible over a circuit switched modem connection, with very low data rates. The first step towards an IP based packet switched (green in figure 1) solution was taken with the evolution of GSM to GPRS, using the same air interface and access method, TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access).\nTo reach higher data rates in UMTS (Universal Mobile Terrestrial System) a new access technology WCDMA (Wideband Code Division Multiple Access) was developed. The access network in UMTS emulates a circuit switched connection for real time services and a packet switched connection for datacom services (black in figure 1). In UMTS the IP address is allocated to the UE when a datacom service is established and released when the service is released. Incoming datacom services are therefore still relying upon the circuit switched core for paging.\nThe Evolved Packet System (EPS) is purely IP based. Both real time services and datacom services will be carried by the IP protocol. The IP address is allocated when the mobile is switched on and released when switched off.\n The new access solution, LTE, is based on OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access) and in combination with higher order modulation (up to 64QAM), large bandwidths (up to 20 MHz) and spatial multiplexing in the downlink (up to 4x4) high data rates can be achieved. The highest theoretical peak data rate on the transport channel is 75 Mbpsin the uplink, and in the downlink, using spatial multiplexing, the rate can be as high as 300 Mbps. \nThe LTE access network is simply a network of base stations, evolved NodeB (eNB), generating a flat architecture (figure 2). There is no centralized intelligent controller, and the eNBs are normally inter-connected viathe X2-interface and towards the core network by the S1-interface (figure 2). The reason for distributing the intelligence amongst the base-stations in LTE is to speed up the connection set-up and reduce the time required for a handover. For an end-user the connection set-up time for a real time data session is in many cases crucial, especially in on-line gaming. The time for a handover is essential for real-time services where end-users tend to end calls if the handover takes too long.\n\nAnother advantage with the distributed solution is that the MAC protocol layer, which is responsible for scheduling, is represented only in the UE and in the base station leading to fast communication and decisions between the eNB and the UE. In UMTS the MAC protocol, and scheduling, is located in the controller and when HSDPA was introduced an additional MAC sub-layer, responsible for HSPA scheduling was added in the NB.\nThe scheduler is a key component for the achievement of a fast adjusted and efficiently utilized radio resource. The Transmission Time Interval (TTI) is set to only 1 ms.\nDuring each TTI the eNB scheduler shall:\n\n- consider the physical radio environment per UE. The UEs report their perceived radio quality, as an input to the scheduler to decide which Modulation and Coding scheme to use. The solution relies on rapid adaptation to channel variations, employing HARQ (Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request) with soft-combining and rate adaptation.\n- prioritize the QoS service requirements amongst the UEs. LTE supports both delay sensitive real-time services as well as datacom services requiring high data peak rates. \n- inform the UEs of allocated radio resources. The eNB schedules the UEs both on the downlink and on the uplink. For each UE scheduled in a TTI the user data will be carried in a Transport Block (TB). DL there can be a maximum of two TBs generated per TTI per UE - if spatial multiplexing is used. The TB is delivered on a transport channel. In LTE the number of channels is decreased compare to UMTS. For the user plane there isonly one shared transport channel in each direction. The TB sent on the channel, can therefore contain bits from a number of services, multiplexed together.\n\nTo achieve high radio spectral efficiency as well as enable efficient scheduling in both time and frequency domain, a multicarrier approach for multiple access was chosen by 3GPP. For the downlink, OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access) was selected and for the uplink SC-FDMA (Single Carrier - Frequency Division Multiple Access) also known as DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform) spread OFDMA (figure 3).\n\nOFDM is a multicarrier technology subdividing the available bandwidth into a multitude of mutual orthogonal narrowband subcarriers. In OFDMA these subcarriers can be shared between multiple users. The OFDMA solution leads to high Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) requiring expensive power amplifiers with high requirements on linearity, increasing the power consumption for the sender. This is no problem in the eNB, but would lead to very expensive handsets. Hence a different solution was selected for the UL. As illustrated in figure 3, the SC-FDMA solution generates a signal with single carrier characteristics, hence with a low PAPR.\nTo enable possible deployment around the world, supporting as many regulatory requirements as possible, LTE is developed for a number of frequency bands - E-UTRA operating bands- currently ranging from 700 MHz up to 2.7GHz. The available bandwidths are also flexible starting with 1.4 MHz up to 20 MHz. LTE is developed to support both the time division duplex technology (TDD) as well as frequency division duplex (FDD). In R8 there are 15 bands specified for FDD and eight bands for TTD. In R9 four bands were added for FDD. Also added in R9 were for example Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service (MBMS), and Home eNB (HeNB), see figure 4.

Since both are shown to be log-normal distributed, DS and SF are generally correlated.\n\nThe result of the negative correlation between log normal shadowing and delay spread is significant because it indicates that for a  larger SF, the DS is reduced, and for a  smaller SF, the DS is increased.\n\nCost 259[3] presents the azimuth spread (AS) as also being log-normal distributed, and likewise being correlated to the DS and SF.  Since the correlation of these parameters is quite high, a spatial channel model needs to be specified that can reproduce this correlation behavior along with the expected probability and range of each parameter. To make sure the model is self-consistent and the full correlation matrix is positive semi-definite, the intra-site correlations between SF, DS and AS are as follows:\n\nThe resulting intra-site correlation matrix is given by A:\n\nIn addition to intra-site correlations given by A, there are also correlations between of these parameters between different sites. These inter-site correlations are given by\n\nEssentially, only inter-site correlations between SF are included.  is the SF correlation which is = 0.5.\n\nSuppose we wish to generate the values for DS, AS, and SF for the nth base station (n = 1 … N) with respect to a given mobile user. These values are given as ,, and , respectively. These values are a function of the respective correlated Gaussian random variables , , and .

The value of  is obtained from analysis of the standard deviation from the regression line of the path loss versus distance.

The PICH is associated either with an S-CCPCH to which a PCH transport channel is mapped, or with a HS-SCCH associated with the HS-PDSCH(s) to which a HS-DSCH transport channel carrying paging messages is mapped.\n\nFigure 24 illustrates the frame structure of the PICH. One PICH radio frame of length 10 ms consists of 300 bits (b0, b1, …, b299). Of these, 288 bits (b0, b1, …, b287) are used to carry paging indicators. The remaining 12 bits are not formally part of the PICH and shall not be transmitted (DTX). The part of the frame with no transmission is reserved for possible future use.\n\nIn each PICH frame, Np paging indicators {P0, …, PNp-1} are transmitted, where Np=18, 36, 72, or 144.\n\nThe PI calculated by higher layers for use for a certain UE, is associated to the paging indicator Pq, where q is computed as a function of the PI computed by higher layers, the SFN of the P-CCPCH radio frame during which the start of the PICH radio frame occurs, and the number of paging indicators per frame (Np):\n\nFurther, the PI calculated by higher layers is associated with the value of the paging indicator Pq. If a paging indicator in a certain frame is set to \"1\" it is an indication that UEs associated with this paging indicator and PI should read either the corresponding frame of the associated S-CCPCH, or the corresponding subframes of the associated HS-SCCH\n\nThe PI bitmap in the PCH data frames over Iub contains indication values for all higher layer PI values possible. Each bit in the bitmap indicates if the paging indicator associated with that particular PI shall be set to 0 or 1. Hence, the calculation in the formula above is to be performed in Node B to make the association between PI and Pq.\n\nThe mapping from {P0, …, PNp-1} to the PICH bits {b0, …, b287} are according to Table 24.\n\nWhen transmit diversity is employed for the PICH, STTD encoding is used on the PICH bits as described in subclause 5.3.1.1.1.",

This service component controls the transfer of the trace records from the NEFs to the OSF. The conceptual model is illustrated in figure 5, which employs both the event report function (CCITT X.734 [14]) and the log control function (CCITT X.735 [15]).\n\nThe trace control function collects traceable events within the NEF and formats them into trace records. These trace records may be stored locally within the NEF filestore or transferred to the OSF in the form of event reports. This is controlled by means of the \"priority\" indicator, which is a part of the trace type. If the \"priority\" indicator is not set then the trace records shall stored within the local filestore and subsequently transferred to the OSF in bulk via FTAM.\n\nIf a trace is activated with the \"priority\" indicator set then the trace records shall be sent to the OSF either direct by the trace control function or through Event Forwarding Discriminators (EFDs).\n\nIf EFDs are used then all trace records are offered to the EFDs. The EFDs determine which of the records are to be transmitted to the OSF in the form of event reports and the Operation System Id field in the header is ignored. The EDFs have complex filter constructs, which allow the operator to define the criteria for destinations and filters.\n\nIf EFDs are not used then all priority records are forwarded to the OSF whose address is given in the Operation System Id field. The NEF is required to supply additional information to provide the OS management application entity title.\n\nFinally, the trace records may also be stored in the form of log entries within the log of the NEF. It is up to the operator to decide if the log function is needed in parallel with the event reporting and file store. Once stored, the log records may be individually accessed by the OSF via the appropriate object management functions. Care should be taken of filter criteria for log records to avoid unnecessary overheads.\n\nThis service component contains the following groups of TMN management functions:\n\n9.2\tTransfer of Records\n\n9.2.1\tBulk record transfer\n\nThis group of TMN functions is concerned with the bulk transfer of trace records from the NEF record filestore to the OSF.\n\nThe trace records shall be transferred from the NEF to the OSF by the use of FTAM services. For further details of the use of FTAM see GSM 12.01 [8].\n\nIn addition to the simple file transfer services provided by FTAM, peertopeer application process communication may also be supported. The use of CMIS services for the uploading of files from the NEF to the OSF is specified in the GSM 12.00 [7].\n\nWhen the procedure defined in GSM 12.00 [7] and GSM 12.01 [8] are used to transfer the trace records, the file type shall be traceRecords and the format of the file is given by the type TraceFileFormat.\n\n9.2.2\tLog control\n\nThis function permits the trace record to be stored and retrieved from logs within the NEF. The logging of these records is performed in accordance with the log control function specified in CCITT X.735 [15] and no additional management functions are required.\n\n9.2.3\tLog access\n\nThis TMN function controls the access to the log described above. Each log defined may contain one or more log entries. Each log entry contains a single trace record.\n\nFor further details concerning the use of logs, see CCITT X.735 [15].\n\nThe following system management functions are required:\n\n9.2.4\tEvent Reporting\n\n9.2.4.1\tEvent Forwarding Discriminators\n\nFor shortterm recording of tracing events and for more complicated filter conditions the event forwarding discriminator construct defined in CCITT X.734 [14] and CCITT X.721 [13] can be employed. The event forwarding discriminator construct is extremely flexible permitting the combination of a number of fields and logical operations with a wide variety of scheduling options. The EFD also controls the destinations to which the event reports are sent. Several such filters may be defined and scheduled for operation at different times and for different time periods.\n\nThe following system management functions are required:\n\n9.2.4.2\tDirect Transfer by Trace Control Function\n\nThis function permits the NEF to transmit trace records direct to the OSF. In general the trace record shall be sent on completion of the call or the traceable event. This function is controlled by means of the \"priority\" indicator, which is contained in the trace type. If the priority indicator is not set, then the trace records shall be stored on file within the NE filestore. These records may be subsequently collected via bulk record transfer as described in subclause 9.2.1. If the trace type specified on activation includes the \"priority\" indicator then all of the records shall be sent via trace reports to the OSF specified by the operation system id.\n\nThe following system management functions are required:",

The overall sequence of events applicable to the UE, NG-RAN and LMF for any location service is shown in Figure 5.2-1.\n\nNote that when the AMF receives a Location Service Request in case of the UE is in CM-IDLE state, the AMF performs a network triggered service request as defined in TS 23.502 [26] in order to establish a signalling connection with the UE and assign a specific serving gNB or ng-eNB. The UE is assumed to be in connected mode before the beginning of the flow shown in the Figure 5.2-1; that is, any signalling that might be required to bring the UE to connected mode prior to step 1a is not shown. The signalling connection may, however, be later released (e.g. by the NG-RAN node as a result of signalling and data inactivity) while positioning is still ongoing.\n\nLocation procedures applicable to NG-RAN occur in steps 3a and 3b in Figure 5.2-1 and are defined in greater detail in this specification.

At most possible occasions for paging, no message arrives for the UE and the power the UE consumed could have been saved. This feature allows the eNB to send the UE a 'wake-up signal' (WUS) to instruct the UE that it has to monitor NPDCCH for paging, and otherwise allows the UE to skip the paging procedures. This allows the UE to potentially keep parts of its hardware switched off for more of the time, and save the power of decoding NPDCCH and NPDSCH for paging. Depending on how long the network allows for the UE to 'wake up' after receiving a WUS, the UE may be able to keep switched on only a receiver dedicated to WUS detection, allowing much of the UE's conventional hardware to remain in a very low-power state.\n\nScheduling request (FDD)\n\nIn Rel-13/14 NB-IoT, scheduling request (SR) exists only as a higher-layer procedure, which triggers a random access procedure to request sufficient UL resource to send a buffer status report (BSR). Rel-15 has added new, more resource and power efficient, ways to achieve this goal which can be configured by the eNB.\n\nFor a connected mode UE, eNB is able to configure by RRC periodic NPUSCH resources for the UE to send BSR, so the eNB is informed when pending traffic has arrived in the UE's buffer. The resources are activated and de-activated ('released') by dynamic signalling on NPDCCH.\n\nA connected mode UE is able to send, in the physical layer, a request to the eNB to be granted NPUSCH resources to send a BSR. This can be done either by a dedicated signal using a pre-configured NPRACH transmission, or via 'piggybacking' the request onto HARQ ACK or NACK transmission from the UE if one is available, by applying a cover code to the ACK or NACK symbols.\n\nEarly data transmission (FDD)\n\nAn idle mode UE is able to transmit data in Msg3 of the random access procedure, carrying between 328 and 1000 bits. After successful reception by eNB, the random access procedure terminates and the UE does not transition to connected mode. The UE requests a grant for EDT if its pending data is smaller than a maximum permitted size configured by eNB, by using a pre-configured set of NPRACH resources for its preamble transmission. The eNB can allow the UE to transmit a smaller amount of data than the maximum permitted size, in order to reduce the power spent transmitting padding bits.\n\nQuick release of RRC connection (FDD and TDD)\n\nA NB-IoT UE has to wait up to 10 seconds, after the receipt of the RRCConnectionRelease message, in case lower layers do not indicate successful acknowledgement of the reception. This feature allows that, in case the UE is not polled, the UE can consider the receipt of the RRCConnectionRelease message to be successfully acknowledged as soon as the UE has sent HARQ ACK. This feature was introduced from the Rel-14 specifications.\n\nRelaxed monitoring for cell reselection (FDD and TDD)\n\nThis feature allows much of the RRM monitoring to be avoided in cases where an NB-IoT UE is stationary and/or the network topology is not changing, and UE battery life can be correspondingly extended. The network configures the UE with a 'NRSRP delta' threshold, and while the change in RSRP its current cell is less than the threshold, the UE does not need to monitor neighbouring cells for 24 hours. This feature was introduced from the Rel-14 specifications.\n\nRLC UM (FDD and TDD)\n\nRel-15 adds support for RLC unacknowledged mode (UM) to complement the acknowledged mode (AM) and transparent mode (TM) introduced in Rel-13. This reduces the need to send RLC signalling over the air for IoT traffic which may be latency and/or loss tolerant, or recoverable by the application layer.\n\nNarrowband measurement accuracy improvement (FDD)\n\nThe narrowband secondary synchronization signal (NSSS) or, on the serving cell, transmissions of MIB-NB on the narrowband physical broadcast channel (NPBCH) can be used for making NRSRP measurements, as alternatives to using narrowband reference signals (NRS). NSSS and NPBCH use more resource elements for their transmission than NRS, and this should reduce the amount of subframes the UE needs to process to achieve a given measurement accuracy.\n\nNPRACH range enhancement (FDD)\n\nNB-IoT is sometimes deployed in cells with radius of up to around 100 km. Rel-13 NPRACH supports cell radii up to 40 km with unambiguous determination of UE range. Beyond that distance, because NPRACH is a pure sine wave transmission, there can be ambiguities for the eNB to determine the UE's range. A new NPRACH format is introduced with a subcarrier spacing of 1.25 kHz and a cyclic prefix of 800 μs, together with frequency hopping, which is sufficient to allow unambiguous range determination up to 120 km.\n\nSmall cell support (FDD and TDD)\n\neNB power classes are defined in NB-IoT to allow deployment of eNBs as microcells, picocells and femtocells, which use lower maximum transmit power than macro eNBs.\n\nReduced system acquisition time (FDD)\n\nIn FDD, when SIB1-NB is being transmitted with 16 repetitions (the maximum supported), eNB can transmit additional subframes containing SIB1-NB repetitions on anchor carriers and non-anchor carriers to allow faster decoding of SIB1-NB and reduce the UE's power consumption during cell access. Compared to Rel-13 which supports up to 8 SIB1-NB repetitions, Rel-15 allows 16 repetitions.\n\nUE differentiation (FDD and TDD)\n\nThe network is able to collect and store in the MME information about the UE and its traffic profile. This can be used to improve the scheduling of the UE according to e.g. its battery life or power supply, mobility, and when it tends to have traffic to transmit.\n\nAccess barring enhancement (FDD and TDD)\n\nIn Rel-13, the network can bar UEs at times of high load on a cell-specific basis. This feature allows UEs to be barred on a per-coverage level basis, so that UEs in deeper coverage levels and needing more repetitions of their transmissions, can be barred separately from other, less resource-intensive, UEs.\n\nMixed standalone operation (FDD)\n\nIn Rel-13, a standalone anchor or non-anchor NB-IoT carrier can only be configured together with another standalone carrier. This feature allows configuration of standalone anchor carriers with in-band and guard-band non-anchor carriers, and of in-band and guard-band anchor carriers with standalone non-anchor carriers. This allows small slices of non-LTE spectrum to be used as a standalone NB-IoT carrier and be linked with NB-IoT carriers associated to LTE spectrum.\n\nPower headroom reporting enhancement (FDD)\n\nIn Rel-13, power headroom reports (PHR) are made by the UE from one of two tables depending on coverage, each containing four entries. This feature improves the granularity of PHR transmitted in Msg3 to have 16 levels.\n\nTDD\n\nSupport for TDD is introduced, incorporating the Rel-13 NB-IoT feature together with Rel-14 features: UE category NB2, 2 UL/DL HARQ processes, multi-carrier RACH and paging, and OTDOA [1]. All LTE UL/DL subframe configurations are supported, except for configurations 0 and 6, and all LTE special subframe configurations are supported. In addition, some Rel-15 features described above are agnostic to FDD/TDD and thus can be used for both.",

Detailed explanation of these procedures can be found in 3GPP TS 48.008 and 3GPP TS 24.008.\nThere are three types of GSM handover that involve a single BSS and a single MSC. These are \"Internal Handover\", \"BSS Internal Handover with MSC Support\"  and\" External Handover\".\nAn \"Internal Handover\" takes place between channels on a cell or cells controlled by a single BSS, without reference to the MSC, although the MSC maybe informed of its occurrence after completion. This typical case can be used by the BSS e.g. if the A-Interface User Plane is not to be modified. This \"Internal Handover\" may take place with AoTDM or with AoIP and is not considered in the present document.\nA \"BSS Internal Handover with MSC Support\" shall only be used if AoIP is supported by both MSC and BSS and if the A-Interface User Plane has to be modified. In that case the BSS or the MSC may initiate a \"BSS Internal Handover with MSC Support\" procedure as described in detail in subclause 6.3 in this document.\n\nHandovers between channels on the same cell or between cells on the same BSS which are controlled by the MSC (as defined prior to the introduction of AoIP) are termed \"External Handovers\" and use identical procedures to those for Inter-BSS-Intra-MSC handovers.  \"External Handovers\" are also specified with AoIP User Plane transport, for example the handover from speech to data services.Handovers from a BSS to an RNS controlled by the same 3G_MSC are intra-3G_MSC GSM to UMTS handovers. Handovers from an RNS to a BSS controlled by the same 3G_MSC are intra-3G_MSC UMTS to GSM handovers.\nThere are two types of handover in UMTS: soft handover and hard handover. The first one is fully performed within UTRAN, without involving the core network. The second one may be also performed within UTRAN or GERAN, or between GERAN and UTRAN, or the core network may be involved if the Iur or Iur-g interface between RNSs does not exist. This case of hard handover involving the core network is covered in the present document, together with SRNS relocation with Iur or Iur-g interface.",

In that case the codec bit rate is reduced so that more throughput is left on the radio interface to add protection. The principle when TFO is active is that as soon as one side detects the need to downgrade the codec rate, it informs the other side and the codec mode is immediately downgraded. There is no negotiation before downgrading.\n\nC.1.1\tUplink downgrading\n\nThe following figure shows the uplink adaptation due to detection by the BTS1 of a bad quality in the uplink from the MS1. In that case the round trip delay between BTS1 and BTS2 has no impact, as the uplink codec adaptation is decided immediately by BTS1 and performed by the MS1.\n\nC.1.2\tDownlink downgrading\n\nThe following figure C.1.2 shows the downlink adaptation due to detection by the MS1 of a bad quality of the downlink from the BTS1. The codec mode adaptation must be performed on the far end MS (MS2), where the source encoder is located. In that case the round trip delay before the downlink adaptation is effective has an high impact. If TFO would not be active, the round trip delay would be smaller, because the Codec Mode Request sent by the BTS1 to the TRAU1 would be immediately taken into account by the TRAU1 and the new codec mode applied in downlink: without TFO ongoing the (tandem) source encoder is located in TRAU1.",

The downlink DPCH can thus be seen as a time multiplex of a downlink DPDCH and a downlink DPCCH, compare subclause 5.2.1.\n\nFigure 9 shows the frame structure of the downlink DPCH. Each frame of length 10 ms is split into 15 slots, each of length Tslot = 2560 chips, corresponding to one power-control period.\n\nThe parameter k in figure 9 determines the total number of bits per downlink DPCH slot. It is related to the spreading factor SF of the physical channel as SF = 512/2k. The spreading factor may thus range from 512 down to 4.\n\nThe exact number of bits of the different downlink DPCH fields (Npilot, NTPC, NTFCI, Ndata1 and Ndata2) is given in table 11. What slot format to use is configured by higher layers and can also be reconfigured by higher layers.\n\nThere are basically two types of downlink Dedicated Physical Channels; those that include TFCI (e.g. for several simultaneous services) and those that do not include TFCI (e.g. for fixed-rate services). These types are reflected by the duplicated rows of table 11. It is the UTRAN that determines if a TFCI should be transmitted and it is mandatory for all UEs to support the use of TFCI in the downlink. The mapping of TFCI bits onto slots is described in [3].\n\nIn compressed frames, a different slot format is used compared to normal mode. There are two possible compressed slot formats that are labelled A and B. Slot format B shall be used in frames compressed by spreading factor reduction and slot format A shall be used in frames compressed by higher layer scheduling. The channel bit and symbol rates given in table 11 are the rates immediately before spreading.\n\nThe pilot bit patterns are described in table 12. The shadowed column part of pilot bit pattern is defined as FSW and FSWs can be used to confirm frame synchronization. (The value of the pilot bit pattern other than FSWs shall be \"11\".) In table 12, the transmission order is from left to right.\n\nIn downlink compressed mode through spreading factor reduction, the number of bits in the TPC and Pilot fields are doubled. Symbol repetition is used to fill up the fields. Denote the bits in one of these fields in normal mode by x1, x2, x3, …, xX. In compressed mode the following bit sequence is sent in corresponding field: x1, x2, x1, x2, x3, x4, x3, x4,…, xX,.\n\nThe relationship between the TPC symbol and the transmitter power control command is presented in table 13.\n\nMulticode transmission may be employed in the downlink, i.e. the CCTrCH (see [3]) is mapped onto several parallel downlink DPCHs using the same spreading factor. In this case, the Layer 1 control information is transmitted only on the first downlink DPCH. DTX bits are transmitted during the corresponding time period for the additional downlink DPCHs, see figure 10.\n\nIn case there are several CCTrCHs mapped to different DPCHs transmitted to the same UE different spreading factors can be used on DPCHs to which different CCTrCHs are mapped. Also in this case, Layer 1 control information is only transmitted on the first DPCH while DTX bits are transmitted during the corresponding time period for the additional DPCHs.",

Primarily, the \"Virtual Reality Profiles for Streaming Media\" specification in TS.26.118 [2] was developed to support Virtual Reality (VR) in streaming applications. In addition, the media capabilities are enabled in Packet Switched Streaming (PSS) Services and Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service (MBMS) by updates of the specifications TS 26.234 [3] and TS 26.346 [4], respectively. The characterization results for audio media profile proponents are documented in TR 26.818 [5].\n\nBased on the findings in TR 26.918 [6], the work item developed the first set of Virtual Reality Profiles for Streaming Media. Virtual Reality (VR) is the ability to be virtually present in a space created by the rendering of natural and/or synthetic image and sound correlated by the movements of the immersed user allowing interacting with that world. Virtual reality typically assumes a user to wear a head mounted display (HMD), to completely replace the user's field of view with a simulated visual component, and to wear headphones, to provide the user with the accompanying audio. In the first set of technologies defined in TS 26.118, VR users are expected to be able to look around from a single observation point in 3D space, also referred to as three degrees of freedom (3DoF). It allows the user to (i) tilt side to side (Rolling), (ii) tilt forward and backward (Pitching), and (iii) turning left and right (Yawing). The specification defines a 3GPP 3DOF reference and coordinate system as well as an end-to-end architecture. In the reference client, it is assumed that pose information, i.e. the position derived by the head tracking sensor expressed by (azimuth; elevation; tilt angle), is continuously available to the VR renderer in order to render the viewport. Based on the system model, video and audio technologies are defined including system technologies (DASH and file format), suitable codecs and rendering technologies.\n\nSpecifically on video, three operation points (combination of elementary stream and rendering metadata) and three corresponding media profiles are defined, namely:\n\nFor PSS, all three profiles are added, the first one is mandatory ( 'shall'), the second one recommended ('should') and the third one allowed ('may'). For MBMS, the first two profiles are added, the first one is mandatory ( 'shall'), the second one is recommended ( 'should') and constrained to non-viewport adaptive streaming.\n\nFor audio, one solution was selected and is documented in TS 26.118, namely MPEG-H 3D Audio Baseline profile. This technology enables the distribution of channel, object and scene-based 3D audio. Additional interesting technologies enabling the distribution of channel, object and scene-based 3D audio were considered, and the characterization results of all proposed technologies are documented in TR 26.818 [5].\n\nIn addition to media specific metadata, system metadata is added to TS 26.118 to support rendering of 360 experiences on 2D screens, including the aspects of rendering without pose information. Basic requirements for a full audio-visual experience are documented under the umbrella of VR Presentations.\n\nThe completion of the work item provides a set of consistent technologies for Virtual Reality in Rel-15 for 5G Phase 1. It is providing a response to the demand identified during the successful joint 3GPP/VR-IF Workshop on Virtual Reality that took place in December 2017 [7], which was an integral part of the development of 3GPP Virtual Reality Profiles for Streaming Applications.\n\nReferences",

A fallback operation to the legacy timing of n+4 is still supported by scheduling from the common search space (CSS), while the short processing time is applicable when scheduling from the user-specific search space (USS). The fallback results in possible collision between n+4 and n+3 timing in different/same DL subframe and/or same/different UL subframe. For example, the use of fallback results in possible uplink collision in the PUCCH format 1/1a/1b resource usage for the same UE when the two DL subframes have been scheduled targeting HARQ feedback in the same UL subframe. Collision handling has been specified to ensure a consistent UE behaviour.\n\nShort processing time is configured per component carrier (CC) by RRC and applies to both DL assignment to HARQ feedback and UL grant to UL transmission.\n\nShort processing time is associated with asynchronous HARQ operation on the UL, and hence PHICH is no longer considered for HARQ feedback of n+3 based scheduling (PHICH is still used for synchronous n+4 based scheduling). HARQ processes on DL are shared between n+4 and n+3 based scheduling, while there is no sharing of HARQ processes between synchronous (n+4) and asynchronous (n+3) HARQ on the UL. The HARQ content for a given UL subframe m can consist of HARQ bits for n+3 carriers as well as HARQ bits for n+4 carriers at the same time.\n\nSimilar to HARQ, shortened processing time also applies to CSI, so that a UE configured with shortened processing time for 1ms TTI will measure CSI on a reference resource no less than 3 subframes away (nCQI_ref greater or equal to 3) from the CSI report. For TM10, the legacy value of the delay between the CSI reference and the CSI report is reduced by 1 subframe (nCQI_ref = legacy value -1).\n\nSRS timing for UE configured with Short processing time is such that for a trigger received in subframe n, aperiodic SRS is transmitted in the first available subframe n+3 or later, subject to the given UL subframe being configured for SRS transmission.\n\nWhen the processing time is shortened, the timing advance takes up a proportionally larger part of the overall processing time available to the UE. A consequence of this is that the maximum timing advance for a CC configured with short processing time is reduced from 667 us to 200 us.",

    "context": "https://www.3gpp.org/technologies/keywords-acronyms/98-lte\n\nLTE\n\nLTE (both radio and core network evolution) is now on the market. Release 8 was frozen in December 2008 and this has been the basis for the first wave of LTE equipment. LTE specifications are very stable, with the added benefit of enhancements having been introduced in all subsequent 3GPP Releases.\n\nLTE (Long Term Evolution) or the E-UTRAN (Evolved Universal Terrestrial Access Network), introduced in 3GPP R8, is the access part of the Evolved Packet System (EPS). The main requirements for the new access network are high spectral efficiency, high peak data rates, short round trip time as well as flexibility in frequency and bandwidth.\n\nGSM was developed to carry real time services, in a circuit switched manner (blue in figure 1), with data services only possible over a circuit switched modem connection, with very low data rates. The first step towards an IP based packet switched (green in figure 1) solution was taken with the evolution of GSM to GPRS, using the same air interface and access method, TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access).\nTo reach higher data rates in UMTS (Universal Mobile Terrestrial System) a new access technology WCDMA (Wideband Code Division Multiple Access) was developed. The access network in UMTS emulates a circuit switched connection for real time services and a packet switched connection for datacom services (black in figure 1). In UMTS the IP address is allocated to the UE when a datacom service is established and released when the service is released. Incoming datacom services are therefore still relying upon the circuit switched core for paging.\nThe Evolved Packet System (EPS) is purely IP based. Both real time services and datacom services will be carried by the IP protocol. The IP address is allocated when the mobile is switched on and released when switched off.\n The new access solution, LTE, is based on OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access) and in combination with higher order modulation (up to 64QAM), large bandwidths (up to 20 MHz) and spatial multiplexing in the downlink (up to 4x4) high data rates can be achieved. The highest theoretical peak data rate on the transport channel is 75 Mbpsin the uplink, and in the downlink, using spatial multiplexing, the rate can be as high as 300 Mbps. \nThe LTE access network is simply a network of base stations, evolved NodeB (eNB), generating a flat architecture (figure 2). There is no centralized intelligent controller, and the eNBs are normally inter-connected viathe X2-interface and towards the core network by the S1-interface (figure 2). The reason for distributing the intelligence amongst the base-stations in LTE is to speed up the connection set-up and reduce the time required for a handover. For an end-user the connection set-up time for a real time data session is in many cases crucial, especially in on-line gaming. The time for a handover is essential for real-time services where end-users tend to end calls if the handover takes too long.\n\nAnother advantage with the distributed solution is that the MAC protocol layer, which is responsible for scheduling, is represented only in the UE and in the base station leading to fast communication and decisions between the eNB and the UE. In UMTS the MAC protocol, and scheduling, is located in the controller and when HSDPA was introduced an additional MAC sub-layer, responsible for HSPA scheduling was added in the NB.\nThe scheduler is a key component for the achievement of a fast adjusted and efficiently utilized radio resource. The Transmission Time Interval (TTI) is set to only 1 ms.\nDuring each TTI the eNB scheduler shall:\n\n- consider the physical radio environment per UE. The UEs report their perceived radio quality, as an input to the scheduler to decide which Modulation and Coding scheme to use. The solution relies on rapid adaptation to channel variations, employing HARQ (Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request) with soft-combining and rate adaptation.\n- prioritize the QoS service requirements amongst the UEs. LTE supports both delay sensitive real-time services as well as datacom services requiring high data peak rates. \n- inform the UEs of allocated radio resources. The eNB schedules the UEs both on the downlink and on the uplink. For each UE scheduled in a TTI the user data will be carried in a Transport Block (TB). DL there can be a maximum of two TBs generated per TTI per UE - if spatial multiplexing is used. The TB is delivered on a transport channel. In LTE the number of channels is decreased compare to UMTS. For the user plane there isonly one shared transport channel in each direction. The TB sent on the channel, can therefore contain bits from a number of services, multiplexed together.\n\nTo achieve high radio spectral efficiency as well as enable efficient scheduling in both time and frequency domain, a multicarrier approach for multiple access was chosen by 3GPP. For the downlink, OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access) was selected and for the uplink SC-FDMA (Single Carrier - Frequency Division Multiple Access) also known as DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform) spread OFDMA (figure 3).\n\nOFDM is a multicarrier technology subdividing the available bandwidth into a multitude of mutual orthogonal narrowband subcarriers. In OFDMA these subcarriers can be shared between multiple users. The OFDMA solution leads to high Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) requiring expensive power amplifiers with high requirements on linearity, increasing the power consumption for the sender. This is no problem in the eNB, but would lead to very expensive handsets. Hence a different solution was selected for the UL. As illustrated in figure 3, the SC-FDMA solution generates a signal with single carrier characteristics, hence with a low PAPR.\nTo enable possible deployment around the world, supporting as many regulatory requirements as possible, LTE is developed for a number of frequency bands - E-UTRA operating bands- currently ranging from 700 MHz up to 2.7GHz. The available bandwidths are also flexible starting with 1.4 MHz up to 20 MHz. LTE is developed to support both the time division duplex technology (TDD) as well as frequency division duplex (FDD). In R8 there are 15 bands specified for FDD and eight bands for TTD. In R9 four bands were added for FDD. Also added in R9 were for example Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service (MBMS), and Home eNB (HeNB), see figure 4. MBMS is used to provide broadcast information to all users, for example advertisement, and multicast to a closed group subscribing to a specific service, e.g. streaming TV. HeNBs are introduced mainly to provide coverage indoors, in homes or offices.The HeNB is a low power eNB that will be used in small cells - femto cells. Normally it will be owned by the customer, deployed without any network planning and connected to the operators EPC (Evolved Packet Core).\n\n- TS 36.211 Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA); Physical channels and modulation\n- TS 36.212 Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA); Multiplexing and channel coding\n- TS 36.213 Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA); Physical layer procedures\n- TS 36.300 Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA) and Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN); Overall description; Stage 2\n- TS 36.321 Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA); Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol specification\n- TS 36.331 Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA); Radio Resource Control (RRC); Protocol specification\n- TS 36.413 Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN); S1 Application Protocol (S1AP)\n- TS 36.423 Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN); X2 Application Protocol (X2AP)\n\nThe technical paper UTRA-UTRAN Long Term Evolution (LTE) and 3GPP System Architecture Evolution (SAE) is a good starting point.\n\nInitiated in 2004, the Long Term Evolution (LTE) project focused on enhancing the Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (UTRA) and optimizing 3GPP's radio access architecture.\n\nThe 3GPP 36 series of specifications, covers the \"Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA)\".\n\nSee also - the technologies page on LTE-Advanced, which describes the work beyond LTE Release 8/9.",

The UE calculates the path loss value based on the RSRP then determines UL transmission power based on several parameters configured by gNB. The reference signal for path loss calculation can be SS/PBCH block or CSI-RS. For PUSCH/PUCCH/SRS transmission, multiple parameter sets can be configured and multiple power control adjustment states can be managed for beam switching purpose. For PRACH, only one parameter set is configured. A parameter set consists of target received power and path loss coefficient. The UE can be configured the linkage between an SRS resource and several parameters about reference signal for path loss calculation, a power control parameter set, and a power control adjustment state. When the linkage is configured, the UE determines UL TPC parameters according to an SRS resource index indicated by DCI. In addition, for FR1 LTE-NR dual connectivity including both EN-DC and NR-E-UTRA dual connectivity (NE-DC), power sharing mechanism between RATs was introduced. When UE supports dynamic power sharing, power allocation for NR is dynamically adjusted on condition that the total transmission power never exceeds allowed value. Dynamic power sharing mechanism is shown in Figure 5.5.4.12-1. When UE does not support dynamic power sharing, the total power is semi-statically split for the two RATs by gNB configuration in order not to exceed the total transmission power, otherwise the UE does not expect to transmit in a slot on the NR when a corresponding subframe on the LTE is an UL subframe.",

This reduces the end-to-end latency and the load on the transport network.\n\nTo enable this, the 5GCN selects a UPF close to the UE and executes the traffic steering from the UPF to the local Data Network via a N6 interface.

The role of STF 160 is to develop the reference TTCN code that enables the verification of the signalling protocol test cases.\n\n2009 is set to exceed all previous years' efforts, as the demand for LTE and HSPA test cases adds to the perennial maintenance of existing test suites. RAN5 is working to ensure the tests fully match market requirements; by making sufficient tests available for the early LTE devices.\n\nRAN5 is now going into overdrive, to meet demand, by doubling the number of meetings. The group is also maintaining very close ties with the Global Certification Forum (GCF Ltd) to ensure that market requirements are precisely met, thus promoting confidence in the test platforms and ensuring that no time is lost developing lower priority tests out of order.\n\nPhil Brown, RAN 5 Chairman, NTT DOCOMO, said: \"It is going to be a very busy 2 years for RAN5, we are attempting to meet the demands of both Release 7 & 8 simultaneously and there is little prospect of the pace lessening as the core specifications for LTE-Advanced gain momentum over the next 12 months.\"",

As mentioned, this is a kind of WAN (Wide Area Network), meaning it would have relatively wide coverage. To provide the wide coverage, it forms a kind of network system which is similar to cellular network. As you see in the following illustration, it has a small central access unit called LoRa Gateway (this is similar to Basestation in cellular system). Around the Gateway are many devices called LoRa end node (this is like a mobile phones). Each of these end unit communicate with a Gateway and the Gateway conveys the user data between the end Unit and Network Server (this is like a core network in cellular system).\n\nIn Jul 2017, SKT (a Network Operator in South Korea) deployed the nation wide IoT network based on LoRa.

This service component controls the transfer of the trace records from the NEFs to the OSF. The conceptual model is illustrated in figure 5, which employs both the event report function (CCITT X.734 [14]) and the log control function (CCITT X.735 [15]).\n\nThe trace control function collects traceable events within the NEF and formats them into trace records. These trace records may be stored locally within the NEF filestore or transferred to the OSF in the form of event reports. This is controlled by means of the \"priority\" indicator, which is a part of the trace type. If the \"priority\" indicator is not set then the trace records shall stored within the local filestore and subsequently transferred to the OSF in bulk via FTAM.\n\nIf a trace is activated with the \"priority\" indicator set then the trace records shall be sent to the OSF either direct by the trace control function or through Event Forwarding Discriminators (EFDs).\n\nIf EFDs are used then all trace records are offered to the EFDs. The EFDs determine which of the records are to be transmitted to the OSF in the form of event reports and the Operation System Id field in the header is ignored. The EDFs have complex filter constructs, which allow the operator to define the criteria for destinations and filters.\n\nIf EFDs are not used then all priority records are forwarded to the OSF whose address is given in the Operation System Id field. The NEF is required to supply additional information to provide the OS management application entity title.\n\nFinally, the trace records may also be stored in the form of log entries within the log of the NEF. It is up to the operator to decide if the log function is needed in parallel with the event reporting and file store. Once stored, the log records may be individually accessed by the OSF via the appropriate object management functions. Care should be taken of filter criteria for log records to avoid unnecessary overheads.\n\nThis service component contains the following groups of TMN management functions:\n\n9.2\tTransfer of Records\n\n9.2.1\tBulk record transfer\n\nThis group of TMN functions is concerned with the bulk transfer of trace records from the NEF record filestore to the OSF.\n\nThe trace records shall be transferred from the NEF to the OSF by the use of FTAM services. For further details of the use of FTAM see GSM 12.01 [8].\n\nIn addition to the simple file transfer services provided by FTAM, peertopeer application process communication may also be supported. The use of CMIS services for the uploading of files from the NEF to the OSF is specified in the GSM 12.00 [7].\n\nWhen the procedure defined in GSM 12.00 [7] and GSM 12.01 [8] are used to transfer the trace records, the file type shall be traceRecords and the format of the file is given by the type TraceFileFormat.\n\n9.2.2\tLog control\n\nThis function permits the trace record to be stored and retrieved from logs within the NEF. The logging of these records is performed in accordance with the log control function specified in CCITT X.735 [15] and no additional management functions are required.\n\n9.2.3\tLog access\n\nThis TMN function controls the access to the log described above. Each log defined may contain one or more log entries. Each log entry contains a single trace record.\n\nFor further details concerning the use of logs, see CCITT X.735 [15].\n\nThe following system management functions are required:\n\n9.2.4\tEvent Reporting\n\n9.2.4.1\tEvent Forwarding Discriminators\n\nFor shortterm recording of tracing events and for more complicated filter conditions the event forwarding discriminator construct defined in CCITT X.734 [14] and CCITT X.721 [13] can be employed. The event forwarding discriminator construct is extremely flexible permitting the combination of a number of fields and logical operations with a wide variety of scheduling options. The EFD also controls the destinations to which the event reports are sent. Several such filters may be defined and scheduled for operation at different times and for different time periods.\n\nThe following system management functions are required:\n\n9.2.4.2\tDirect Transfer by Trace Control Function\n\nThis function permits the NEF to transmit trace records direct to the OSF. In general the trace record shall be sent on completion of the call or the traceable event. This function is controlled by means of the \"priority\" indicator, which is contained in the trace type. If the priority indicator is not set, then the trace records shall be stored on file within the NE filestore. These records may be subsequently collected via bulk record transfer as described in subclause 9.2.1. If the trace type specified on activation includes the \"priority\" indicator then all of the records shall be sent via trace reports to the OSF specified by the operation system id.\n\nThe following system management functions are required:",

Edited by Harri Holma and Antti Toskala.\n\nWhen the evolution of the radio interface started (E-UTRAN), it soon became clear that the system architecture would also need to be evolved. The general drive towards optimizing the system only for packet switched services is one reason that alone would have set the need for evolution, but some of the radio interface design goals - such as removal of soft handover - opened up new opportunities in the architecture design. Also, since it had been shown by High Speed Packet Access (HSPA) that all radio functionality can be efficiently co-located in the NodeB, the door was left open for discussions of flatter overall architecture.\n\nDiscussions for System Architecture Evolution (SAE) then soon followed the radio interface development, and it was agreed to schedule the completion of the work in Release 8. There had been several reasons for starting this work, and there were also many targets.\n\nThe following lists some of the targets that possibly shaped the outcome the most:\n\nMany of the targets implied that a flat architecture would need to be developed. Flat architecture with less involved nodes reduces latencies and improves performance.\n\nDevelopment towards this direction had already started in Release 7 where the Direct Tunnel concept allows User Plane (UP) to bypass the SGSN, and the placement of RNC functions to HSPA NodeB was made possible. The Figure here (left) shows these evolution steps and how this aspect was captured at a high level in SAE architecture.\n\nSome of the targets seem to drive the architecture development in completely different directions. For example, optimized inter-working with several wireless access networks (ANs) indicates the need to introduce a set of new functions and maybe even new interfaces to support specific protocols separately for each one of them. This works against the target of keeping the architecture simple. Therefore, since it is likely that that none of the actual deployments of the architecture would need to support all of the potential inter-working scenarios, the 3GPP architecture specifications were split into two tracks:\n\nExtracted from Chapter 3 of \"LTE for UMTS: Evolution to LTE-Advanced\"...See Wiley.com for further details about the book.\n\n[1] 3GPP TS 23.401, 'General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) enhancements for Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN) access (Release 8)'.\n\n[2] 3GPP TS 23.402, 'Architecture enhancements for non-3GPP accesses (Release 8)'",

Operators have met this challenge by increasing capacity with new radio spectrum, adding multi-antenna techniques and implementing more efficient modulation and coding schemes.\n\nHowever, these measures alone are insufficient in the most crowded environments and at cell edges where performance can significantly degrade. Operators are also adding small cells and tightly-integrating these with their macro networks to spread traffic loads, widely maintain performance and service quality while reusing spectrum most efficiently.\n\nOne way to expand an existing macro-network, while maintaining it as a homogeneous network, is to \"densify\" it by adding more sectors per eNB or deploying more macro-eNBs. However, reducing the site-to-site distance in the macro-network can only be pursued to a certain extent because finding new macro-sites becomes increasingly difficult and can be expensive, especially in city centres. An alternative is to introduce small cells through the addition of low-power base stations (eNBs, HeNBs or Relay Nodes (RNs)) or Remote Radio Heads (RRH) to existing macro-eNBs. Site acquisition is easier and cheaper with this equipment which is also correspondingly smaller.\n\nSmall cells are primarily added to increase capacity in hot spots with high user demand and to fill in areas not covered by the macro network - both outdoors and indoors. They also improve network performance and service quality by offloading from the large macro-cells. The result is a heterogeneous network with large macro-cells in combination with small cells providing increased bitrates per unit area. See Figure 1.\n\nHeterogeneous network planning was already used in GSM. The large and small cells in GSM are separated through the use of different frequencies. This solution is still possible in LTE. However, LTE networks mainly use a frequency reuse of one to maximize utilization of the licensed bandwidth.\n\nIn heterogeneous networks the cells of different sizes are referred to as macro-, micro-, pico- and femto-cells; listed in order of decreasing base station power. The actual cell size depends not only on the eNB power but also on antenna position, as well as the location environment; e.g. rural or city, indoor or outdoor . The HeNB (Home eNB) was introduced in LTE Release 9 (R9). It is a low power eNB which is mainly used to provide indoor coverage, femto-cells, for Closed Subscriber Groups (CSG), for example, in office premises. See Figure 2.\n\nSpecific to HeNBs, is that they are privately owned and deployed without coordination with the macro-network. If the frequency used in the femto-cell is the same as the frequency used in the macro-cells, and the femto-cell is only used for CSG, then there is a risk of interference between the femto-cell and the surrounding network.\n\nThe Relay Node (RN) is another type of low-power base station added to the LTE R10 specifications. The RN is connected to a Donor eNB (DeNB) via the Un radio interface, which is based on the LTE Uu interface. See Figure 2. When the frequencies used on Uu and Un for the RN are the same, there is a risk of self interference in the RN. From the UE perspective the RN will act as an eNB, and from the DeNB's view the RN will be seen as a UE. As also mentioned, RRHs connected to an eNB via fibre can be used to provide small cell coverage.\n\nIntroducing a mix of cell sizes and generating a heterogeneous network adds to the complexity of network planning. In a network with a frequency reuse of one, the UE normally camps on the cell with the strongest received DL signal (SSDL), hence the border between two cells is located at the point where SSDL is the same in both cells. In homogeneous networks, this also typically coincides with the point of equal path loss for the UL (PLUL) in both cells. In a heterogeneous network, with high-power nodes in the large cells and low-power nodes in the small cells, the point of equal SSDL will not necessarily be the same as that of equal PLUL. See Figure 3.\n\nA major issue in heterogeneous network planning is to ensure that the small cells actually serve enough users. One way to do that is to increase the area served by the small cell, which can be done through the use of a positive cell selection offset to the SSDL of the small cell. This is called Cell Range Extension (CRE). See Figure 4.\n\nA negative effect of this is the increased interference on the DL experienced by the UE located in the CRE region and served by the base station in the small cell. This may impact the reception of the DL control channels in particular.\n\nA number of features added to the 3GPP LTE specification can be used to mitigate the above-mentioned interference problem in heterogeneous networks with small cells:\n\nICIC was introduced in R8. The eNBs can communicate using ICIC via the X2 interface to mitigate inter-cell interference for UEs at the cell edge. The X2AP message used for this is called \"Load Information\". See Figure 5. Through the \"Load Information\" message an eNB can inform neighbouring eNBs about: UL interference level per Physical Resource Block (PRB); UL PRBs that are allocated to cell edge UEs, and hence are sensitive to UL interference; and if DL Tx power is higher or lower than a set threshold value. The eNBs receiving these messages can use the received information to optimize scheduling for UEs at cell edges.\n\nICIC has evolved to better support heterogeneous network deployments -- especially interference control for DL control channels. Enhanced ICIC (eICIC) was introduced in LTE R10. The major change is the addition of time domain ICIC, realized through use of Almost Blank Subframes (ABS). ABS includes only control channels and cell-specific reference signals, no user data, and is transmitted with reduced power. When eICIC is used, the macro-eNB will transmit ABS according to a semi-static pattern. During these subframes, UEs at the edge, typically in the CRE region of small cells, can receive DL information, both control and user data. The macro-eNB will inform the eNB in the small cell about the ABS pattern. See Figure 6.\n\nICIC is evolved in LTE R11 to further enhanced ICIC (feICIC). The focus here is interference handling by the UE through inter-cell interference cancellation for control signals, enabling even further cell range extension.\n\neICIC and feICIC are especially important when Carrier Aggregation (CA) is not used.\n\nCarrier Aggregation (CA) is introduced in R10, with backward compatibility to R8, to increase the total bandwidth available to UEs and hence their maximum bitrates. When CA is used a number of R8 carriers, referred to as Component Carriers (CC), are aggregated and any CA-capable UE can be allocated resources on all CCs, while R8/R9 UEs can only be allocated resources on one CC. Cross-carrier scheduling is an important feature in heterogeneous networks. Using cross-carrier scheduling it is possible to map the Physical DL control channels (PDCCH) on different CCs in the large and small cells. See Figure 7. The PDCCH, carrying DL Control Information (DCI) with scheduling information, must be received by the UEs at the cell edge; PDCCH may be transmitted with higher power than the traffic channels. Hence, using different carriers for the PDCCH in the large and small cells reduces the risk of PDCCH interference.\n\nFrom LTE R11 onwards it is possible to handle CA with CCs requiring different timing advance (TA); for example, combining CCs from eNBs with CCs from RRHs. See Figure 8.\n\nOne way to ensure that a UE is using both the best DL and the best UL carrier in a heterogeneous network is to use CoMP, introduced in LTE R11. With CoMP a number of transmission/reception points (i.e. eNBs, RNs or RRHs) can be coordinated to provide service to a UE - for example, data can be transmitted at the same time in the same PRBs from more than one transmission point to one UE, or data can be received from one transmission point in one subframe and from another transmission point in the next subframe. CoMP can be used both in DL and UL. When CoMP is used in a heterogeneous network a number of macro-cells and small cells can be involved in data transmission to and from one UE. Especially useful in heterogeneous networks is the possibility for a UE in the cell range extension region to utilize the best UL in the small cell and the best DL in the macro-cell. See Figure 9. This, however, requires that the macro-eNB and the base station in the small cell are synchronized, and most likely it will require a combination of macro-eNB with RRHs in the small cell.\n\nFurther enhancements regarding heterogeneous network and small cells are coming in future 3GPP Releases. At the time of writing, Release 12 is still in the process of being formulated with some features in the study phase and others, such as work on interference management for neighbour TDD cells, dual connectivity between the macro cell and small cells, mobility planning within hyper-dense environments and advances in carrier aggregation combinations already in the normative phase (specifications).\n\nFuture updates to this paper will include what has been achieved with the completion of Release 12 during the second half of 2014.\n\n\"...Coordinating the low-power layer of small cells with the macro network improves performance across the entire network while also further boosting efficiencies in spectrum use and power consumption, automating network configuration and optimization. The upcoming 3GPP Release 12 (due to be frozen September 2014) standardises various capabilities in these developments including dual connectivity, small cell on/off and 256 QAM...\" ...Read the full article",

In release 13, you would see many statements about BL UE/CE UE, but I took me quite a while to find out what they stands for :) (I found it in 36.300).\n\nIn many Whitepaper or articles, you might have seen the term like MTC, LTE-M1. But in formal 3GPP Technical Specification, you would noticed that these terminology (e.g, MTC, LTE-M1) is not clearly defined. In 3GPP TS, the term BL/CE is usually used to indicate the implementation of LTE-M1.\n\nIn short, LTE-M1 (BL/CE) is an design / implementation that is to meet the MTC criteria as shown below.\n\nHow is LTE M1 compatitle with legacy LTE ? Actually this can be a pretty fundamental question and help you a lot to understand about LTE M1 and Legay LTE comparison, but I asked this question to myself with more practical reason. When I started to reading LTE M1 3GPP specification (I think it was around Aug 2016), I was eager to try something myself just to understand the specification itself. (I am not such a genious to understand the details just by reading the documents. There has been almost nothing that I got a detailed understanding without hands-on). Of course, at that time there was no LTE M1 device that I could try with and I didn't have any LTE-M1 capable test equipment either. Fortunately, However, I had access to a couple of pretty good toys : a LTE network simulator with super detailed controllability and high performance vector signal analyzer with LTE analysis feature. So my idea was :\n\nAnd with some other reason, I thought I might tweak my super flexible LTE network simulator to act like LTE-M1 eNB at physical layer at least. But the hard reality that I realized was 'it SOUND very similar to legacy LTE, but not same. Not even at the level of similarity where the legacy LTE can be tweaked to emulate a small feature set of LTE-M1'. In short, followings LTE-M1 feature is same as legacy LTE.\n\nIt means if you have LTE-M1 device, you may test with the legacy LTE equipment to check if it can detect the cell and decode physical cell ID and check if it can come up with reasonal measurement of RSRP, RSRQ.\n\nHowever, the similarity ends here. All other things are not compatible with the legacy LTE even if they sound similar. Even for MIB (PBCH), LTE-M1 uses different resource element mapping from legacy LTE (See LTE-M1 PBCH). SIB1 decoding is not compatible either. LTE-M1 SIB1 scheduling is not determined by DCI. It is determined by a single parameter contained in MIB and a set of pretty complex predefined table. On top of it, the physical location of SIB1 hops among multiple locations (i.e, across the multiple narrowband index). See LTE-M1 SIB1 (i.e, SIB1-BR) page for the details. From here (from RACH), the differences diverges even further. The scheduling method is completely different and almost every transmission of PDSCH, PUSCH is being done in very specially designed repeating fashion.\n\nIn short, my final conclusion was to give up the attempt to try LTE-M1 by tweaking the legacy LTE protocol stack and decided to wait until I get a touch on real LTE-M1 device and LTE-M1 equipment. Now (as of Mar 2017) I got access to LTE-M1 test equipment and waiting to get a touch to LTE-M1 UE :)\n\nFollowings are list of the detailed topics. I am assuming that readers already have knowledge on how legacy LTE works and I will describe these topics with focus on the differences from the legacy LTE.",

    "context": "https://www.sharetechnote.com/html/IoT/IoT_WhatToChoose.html\n\nIoT: What to choose\n\nNow let's assume that you got the full unstanding of each of the IoT related technology individually and did a little bit of categorization, you may come up with some daisy chain like diagram as illustrated below.\n\nWhat is confusing you would not be the technical details of each individual technology. What confuse you would about 'how one technology differs from other technologies ?' or 'which technology I have to chose for my application or use model ?'\n\nThe simple answer to the question \"Which technology do I have to pick for my application or my use model ?\" is \"It depends on the nature of your application\".\n\nI know.. you would not take this as an answer. You would ask for more specific answers.\n\nIf you want to get more specific answers, you would have specific answers to a lot of specific questions as listed below. (This list would get extended as learn/observe more from various discussions/forums).\n\nI would not put my comments on each of the questions for now.. just to give you some time for you to think.. (good excuse for my laziness :)).\n\nThis is basically asking about the data rate of the end node in your IoT system. Is it collecting a simple data like Temperature, Humidity which takes up only several bytes at a time of transmission. Normally this kind of IoT device should be very low cost. It is less likely to let this kind of device to use relatively expensive network (like cellular network).\n\nThis is asking 'Are you going to use a simple sensors (like temperature, humidity) ?' or some other devices which requires a relatively large packet transmission/reception or which requires very high level data security.\n\nThis would be highly related to Q1. Usually the type of data to be collected and transmitted would determine the necessary data rate, but there might be some exceptions. For example, if you need very sophisticated data security and add a lot of additional portions to the original data to implement the security, the data rate that you would need would get much higher. Another exception can be the case where you want to upgrade/reconfigure your end-node remotely. Of course, this would not happen very often but if you really want to do this, the data rate should be pretty high for the end-node to download necessary firmware and configuration information.\n\nQ4. Does your end node device will both transmit and receive data ? or only transmit the data (no recieve) ?\n\nMost of the IoT application is Uplink centeric (transmission only in terms of end-device) and in some extreme case there are some application that is uplink only. It is understandable for most of IoT application to be Uplink dominant but there would be a lot of restriction if it goes with uplink only. For example, you have a very simple end-device (e.g, a temperature sensor) and transmitted it to a Gateway or Basestation. If the device is uplink only (transmission only), the device can only transmit the data and there is no way to verify whther it successfully reached the destination or not. To verify the successful transmission of the data, there should be some mechanism by which the destination (e.g, Gateway) can send Acknowledge message to the device that has sent the data. To do this, the system should allow downlink (i.e, reception in terms of end-device). Also, if you want to apply any form of data security or remote re-configuration or remote update, you need both uplink and downlink.\n\nLet me ask another question before this .. Are you going to use unlicensed band/frequency (i.e ISM band) or a licensed band / frequency (e.g, Cellular) ? If you decided to use ISM band, it is highly likely to use sub Ghz band (i.e, around 900 Mhz) or around 2.4 Ghz frequency. If you decided to use licensed band, it will be determined by which frequency will be allowed in the area where your IoT system will be installed.\n\nIf you selected unlicensed band, you are free to use any of the frequency .. but it is not only you who is free to use the frequency.. there might be a lot of other devices that uses the same frequency which might cause unwanted interference. If you decided to use the licensed frequency, there will be licensing / permission issue.\n\nIf the transmitter and reciever is communicating within the range of couple of meters or tens of meters, you can use many of the existing short range communication like Bluetooth, ZigBee etc. However, if it should extend to several km or tens of km, you have to use those technologies that can cover wide range like LPWAN (e.g, LoRa, SigFox etc) or Cellular technology.\n\nBasically IoT requires a cirtain type of Network structure whether it is small or large (in most case it is not peer to peer communication). Then you would have question on how to form such a network and how much control you want to have over the whole network. Some people would say 'I want to implement only the end Node(e.g, terminal sensor module) and get it connected to an exisiting network that are already established'. In this case, you would consider Cellular based IoT or SigFox. In this option, you would have less work to do but very limitted or no controllability for network. Some people would say 'I want to implement everything from the end node to the network and I want to have full control over the network'. In this case, you may like LoRa type of technology. You would have full controllability, but downside is that there are a lot of works for you to do.\n\nFor example, SKT deployed a Nation wide IoT service in South Korea around the end of 2016 based on LoRa technology. According to Ref [5], they were considering LoRa, SigFox, NB-LTE(and other LTE based IoT). LTE IoT was excluded for other reason, but between LoRa and SigFox, the controllability to Network was one of the factor to select LoRa.\n\nQ10. Do you need any security for the data being transmitted and received ? At which level, if you need ?\n\nI personally think this is pretty important issue since there are many cases where it is not easy to change / upgrade the software of a IoT end node once it is installed or take too much cost to visit every installation points and change software of the device. However, I don't see this issues widely discussed in the industry yet (as of early 2017). Probably they are afraid to bring up the issues that does not have any simple / easy solution. In theory, the smartest solution is to let the end node device itself to download the new software and upgrade it by itself. We have seen this type of software upgrade in cellular phone (smart phone) pretty commonly these days. We may think of utilizing the similar technologies to IoT devices. However, the biggest problem would be the bandwidth. Most of IoT device is designed for low data rate communication, but this kind of wireless software upgrade would take pretty big bandwidth. So if you think of this kind of wireless software upgrade, you would need to choose such a technology to provide big enough bandwidth for wireless woftware upgrade.\n\nQ12. What kind of protocol (phy, mac, application layer protocol) do you want to use ?\n\nThere are many different technologies that claim to be the best for IoT. Some of them would already be available at your time of deployment, but some technologies would be being talked a lot but not available or not mature yet. So if your deployment schedule is very near, you would need to choose a technology that are mature right now.\n\nFor example, SKT deployed a Nation wide IoT service in South Korea around the end of 2016 based on LoRa technology. According to Ref [5], they were considering LoRa, SigFox, NB-LTE(and other LTE based IoT). SigFox were excluded for other reason, but between LoRa and SigFox, LoRa was selected mainly due to availability. LoRa technology was already there when they were planning, but there were still a couple of years to go for LTE based IoT to be mature enough.\n\n[3] NarrowBand IoT Demystified: What are the benefits and why do we need it?

It may use either the control- or user-plane protocols as underlying transport. In this specification, only control plane use of LPP is defined. User plane support of LPP is defined in [15] and [16].\n\nLPP messages are carried as transparent PDUs across intermediate network interfaces using the appropriate protocols (e.g., NGAP over the NG-C interface, NAS/RRC over the LTE-Uu and NR-Uu interfaces). The LPP protocol is intended to enable positioning for NR and LTE using a multiplicity of different position methods, while isolating the details of any particular positioning method and the specifics of the underlying transport from one another.\n\nThe protocol operates on a transaction basis between a target device and a server, with each transaction taking place as an independent procedure. More than one such procedure may be in progress at any given moment. An LPP procedure may involve a request/response pairing of messages or one or more \"unsolicited\" messages. Each procedure has a single objective (e.g., transfer of assistance data, exchange of LPP related capabilities, or positioning of a target device according to some QoS and use of one or more positioning methods). Multiple procedures, in series and/or in parallel, can be used to achieve more complex objectives (e.g., positioning of a target device in association with transfer of assistance data and exchange of LPP related capabilities). Multiple procedures also enable more than one positioning attempt to be ongoing at the same time (e.g., to obtain a coarse location estimate with low delay while a more accurate location estimate is being obtained with higher delay).\n\nAn LPP session is defined between a positioning server and the target device, the details of its relation with transactions are described in clause 4.1.2 of TS 36.355 [19].\n\nFor the 3GPP 5GS Control Plane solution defined in TS 23.501 [2] and TS 23.502 [26], the UE is the target device and the LMF is the server.

A slot transmission is simply a shortening of the current subframe transmission in half, while a subslot transmission consist of either a 2-symbol or a 3-symbol transmission duration.\n\nThe subslot division in a subframe is fixed in the UL while it varies depending on the first potential symbol for PDSCH in the DL, as shown in Figure 13.8-2. Each subframe is divided into up to 6 subslots. Subslot operation is not defined for lDataStart=4.\n\nThe slot operation is defined for both FS1 and FS2, while subslot operation is only defined for FS1. FS3 is not supported.\n\nThe combinations of slot and subslot operation on DL and UL are shown in Table 1. The asymmetric operation of subslot in DL and slot in UL is primarily allowed to improve coverage for the UL control channel.\n\nIn a carrier aggregation setting, an sTTI DL/UL combination is configured per component carrier (CC). A CA PUCCH group should have the same UL/DL sTTI configuration for the sTTI-configured SCells and the cell carrying PUCCH. However Different DL/UL sTTI lengths can be configured for the serving cells across different PUCCH groups. sTTI operation can also be configured in a DL only Scell. The maximum number of supported UL and DL sTTI carriers is the same as in 1 ms TTI operation. Cross-carrier scheduling is not supported for sTTI.\n\nThe physical channels for subslot and slot operation are given in Table 13.8-3.\n\nAs can be seen, although the transmission duration of the data channels (PDSCH/PUSCH) also follows the slot and subslot transmission duration, they are not defined as new physical channels. Except for some changes on the transport block size (TBS), resource allocation scheme and DL/UL UE-specific reference signal pattern, the main characteristics of the 1 ms data channels have been maintained. Both UL and DL control channels, on the other hand, have been significantly re-designed motivating to treat them as separate physical channels in the specification. SPUCCH follows subslot and slot duration (including also SR with a periodicity down to 1 subslot), while SPDCCH has either 1 os, 2 os or 3 os duration, transmitted at the start of each subslot/slot, and may span only configured frequency resources as illustrated in Figure 13.8-3.\n\nA fallback mode to 1 ms transmission is also supported for subslot and slot operation, the fallback is dynamic and can occur on a subframe to subframe basis. The UE needs to monitor both 1 ms and subslot/slot based control. Collision handling in case of simultaneous subslot/slot and subframe transmission in UL on the same CC has been specified to ensure a consistent UE behaviour.\n\nBoth CRS-based and DMRS-based demodulation is supported for SPDCCH and in case of CRS-based SPDCCH, the mapping of the SPDCCH can be configured to be either over 1 or 2 symbols in time (1 symbol illustrated above in Figure 3). In case of DMRS-based SPDCCH, the control is always mapped over 2 symbols for slot-based SPDCCH, while for subslot it aligns with the subslot duration (2 or 3 symbols).\n\nTo efficiently make use of the control resources not used in a subslot/slot, a re-use mechanism is specified to re-use the control region for data, illustrated in Figure 4. Both a semi-static and dynamic mechanism is specified. The efficiency of the re-use depends on the configuration (ideal re-use assumed in Figure 13.8-4).\n\nTo further minimize overhead, the DL DMRS can be shared between two consecutive subslots within a slot . The presence of the DL DMRS for PDSCH in subslot operation is indicated in the DL DCI (present or not). In UL the DMRS can be shared between all three subslots of a slot. The UL DMRS presence and position is indicated in the UL DCI. A possible configuration of the UL DMRS in a subframe that minimizes DMRS overhead is illustrated in Figure 13.8-5.\n\nThe specification also allows for DMRSs symbols to be shared between UEs in the UL, also referred to as DMRS multiplexing. In this case, an IFDMA based DMRS is typically used which allows users of different resource allocation to share the DMRS symbol by the use of different IFDMA combs, maintaining orthogonality between UEs.\n\nAs with short processing time for 1 ms, subslot/slot transmissions are associated with asynchronous HARQ operation on the UL. The processing time compared to regular 1 ms operation and the maximum timing advance are also reduced for both slot and subslot operation. In case of subslot operation, the UE can in its capability indicate the support of different processing timeline sets with associated maximum timing advance depending on the DL control channel configuration (DMRS-based SPDCCH, 1os CRS-based SPDCCH or 2os CRS-based SPDCCH). The processing timelines and associated maximum timing advance is summarized in Table 13.8-4. As can be seen, for each processing timeline set, there are two possible processing timelines (for example n+4 and n+6 for Set 1). Which one to use is under network control and configured by RRC (depending on the timing advance assigned to the UE).\n\nThe number of HARQ processes has been increased to 16 for slot/subslot operation and the HARQ processes can be shared between subslot/slot and 1 ms operation (with the restriction that the TBS and number of codewords limitations of subslot/slot need to be respected in case of initial transmission on 1 ms with a later retransmission on subslot/slot).\n\nA new set of DCI formats, named DCI format 7.x is associated with sTTI for slot and subslots scheduling. Among the specific features of these DCI formats, resource allocation has been modified to reflect the shorter TTI and therefore the granularity in RB allocation is increased.\n\nAdditional functionality also specified in the feature is sTTI specific aperiodic CSI reporting which includes measuring on a slot/subslot CSI reference resource as well as faster triggering and faster processing time for the CSI to be reported. Periodic CSI reporting is not supported.\n\nAlso, semi-persistent scheduling is specified for sTTI with similar functionality as in legacy operation. A contention based SPS operation is allowed where different UEs can be assigned different cyclic shifts and IFDMA combs for the DMRS, but fully/partially overlapping resource allocation.\n\nReferences",

The architecture and radio parts of NSA are reminded in the Figure below.\n\nThe eNB is the master node (MN) while the en-gNB is the secondary node (SN).\n\nThe E-UTRAN uses the per-UE information supplied by the MME and local E-UTRAN configuration data to determine whether or not to use Dual Connectivity for that UE. On a per-EPS bearer (4G bearer) basis, the E-UTRAN decides whether to use a Master Cell Group bearer or a Secondary Cell Group bearer, and, whether or not that bearer is a split bearer, as defined in the section on the NSA Access Network.\n\nFor example, the Master eNB can decide to use the 5G en-gNB for user data (the \"Internet\" PDN connection), as to enjoy the 5G \"high capacity\" aspect, and to use the 4G eNB for IMS Signalling and IMS voice, as to enjoy the 4G \"robust coverage layer\" aspect.\n\nThe following figures illustrate some of the alternative configurations in the context of a Master Cell Group (MCG) and a Secondary Cell Group (SCG) respectively. Note that, as in the above example, one UE can use these configurations simultaneously. Also note that, in general, the EPC has no concrete information about whether the E-UTRAN is using Dual Connectivity, nor what configuration of Dual Connectivity is in use.\n\nNote that it is also possible to operate NSA with an unmodified pre-Release 15 EPC (4G CN). In order to support the SCG bearer, the EPC does however need to support the Release 12 Dual Connectivity feature.\n\nSeveral features have been introduced to enhance the functionality of the EPC for use with NR:\n\nWithin SA3, the security aspects were examined and CRs were generated that enabled the existing EPS security algorithms to be reused for signalling confidentiality and integrity protection, and, user plane confidentiality.",

The SON architecture can be a centralized, distributed or a hybrid solution.\n\nThis is the dynamic plug-and-play configuration of newly deployed eNBs. The eNB will by itself configure the Physical Cell Identity, transmission frequency and power, leading to faster cell planning and rollout.\n\nThe interfaces S1 and X2 are dynamically configured, as well as the IP address and connection to IP backhaul. To reduce manual work ANR (Automatic neighbour relations) is used. ANR configures the neighbouring list in newly deployed eNBs and is optimizing the list configuration during operation.\n\nDynamic configuration includes the configuration of the Layer 1 identifier, Physical cell identity (PCI) and Cell global ID (CGID). There are 504 different PCIs available in LTE, the PCI mapping shall fulfill the collision free condition as well as the confusion free. The PCI can be assigned either in a centralized or distributed way.\n\nWhen centralised assignment is used the OAM system will have a complete knowledge and control of the PCIs. When the distributed solution is used the OAM system assigns a list of possible PCIs to the newly deployed eNB, but the adoption of the PCI is in control of the eNB. The newly deployed eNB will request a report, sent either by User Equipment (UEs) over the air interface or by other eNBs over the X2 interface, including already in-use PCIs, see figure 1. - The eNB will randomly select its PCI from the remaining values.\n\nANR is used to minimize the work required for configuration in newly deployed eNBs as well as to optimize configuration during operation. Correct and up-to-date neighbouring lists will increase the number of successful handovers and minimize the number of dropped calls. Before a handover can be executed the source eNB requires the neighbouring information: PCI and CGID of the target eNB.\n\nThe PCI is included in every normal measurement report. The mapping between the PCI and CGID parameters can be done by using information from the OAM or reported by UEs decoding the target cell CGID on the broadcast channel in the target cell, see figure 2. The capability of decoding CGID is an optional UE feature.\n\nA network operator can put a cell on a ANR black list, to block certain handover candidates, for example from indoor to outdoor cells. 3GPP has also specified LTE Inter-Frequency and Inter-RAT (Radio Access Technology) ANR.\n\nFunctions for self-optimisation are mainly included in Release 9. It includes optimisation of coverage, capacity, handover and interference.\n\nMobility load balancing (MLB) is a function where cells suffering congestion can transfer load to other cells, which have spare resources. MLB includes load reporting between eNBs to exchange information about load level and available capacity.\n\nThe periodicity of the reporting can be requested in the range of 1 to 10 s. The report can contain, hardware load, S1 transport network load and Radio resource status. The Radio resource status reports are separated in Up Link and Down Link reports, including the total allocation guaranteed and non-guaranteed bit rate traffic, the percentage of allocated Physical Resource Block (PRB) and the percentage of PRBs available for load balancing.\n\nMLB can also be used between different Radio Technologies. In case of inter-RAT the load reporting RAN Information Management (RIM) protocol will be used to transfer the information via the core between the base stations of different radio technologies. A cell capacity class value, set by the OAM-system, will be used to compare and weigh the different technologies radio capacities against each other.\n\nA handover due to load balancing is carried out as a regular handover, but it may be necessary to amend parameters so that the User Equipment (UE) does not return to the congested cell. The amendment must take place in both cells, so that the handover settings remain coherent in both. The eNBs need to estimate how much the cell border needs to be shifted, expressed in dB, to avoid a quick return of the UE.\n\nMobility robustness optimization (MRO) is a solution for automatic detection and correction of errors in the mobility configuration. In Release 9 the focus is on errors causing Radio link failure (RLF) due to too late or early handover, or handover to an incorrect cell.\n\nIn case of late handover, see figure 3, the handover procedure in the source cell is initialized too late, since the UE is moving faster than the Handover (HO) parameter settings allow. Hence when the RRC HO command from the serving cell is transmitted the signal strength is too weak to reach the UE, now located in the target cell, connection is lost. The UE attempts a connection re-establishment, containing PCID and C-RNTI belonging to the source cell, but received by the target cell. The target eNB will then inform the source cell about RLF to adjust Handover parameters.\n\nIt is a bit more complicated to detect a too early handover, see figure 4. The UE has successfully been handed over from source cell A to target cell B, but since it was triggered too early the connection will drop almost immediately due to too poor radio conditions in the target cell B. The UE will then try to re-establish the connection, which will now take place in the original source cell, cell A, since this cell is the strongest one. The UE will use the PCID and RNTI from the target cell B and the source cell A will then consider this as a Radio Link Failure due to too late handover and send an indication to the target cell B. But the target cell B will now recognize the parameters in the indication, as given to a mobile that had just completed a handover to cell B from cell A now indicating failure. The target cell B will send back a report about too early Handover to adjust Handover parameters, to the source cell A.\n\nIn order to save energy some cells can be switched off when capacity is not needed. The power consumption in a base station is not only related to load, a number of functions requires power even if there are no users to serve. But, if a cell is switched off, in the legal operator license there are still requirements on coverage, the coverage must be maintained at all times! The suspension of the cell may occur when the last user leaves the cell, all incoming handovers during this period of time will then be rejected. The cells that remain on, providing coverage, can wake up a suspended cell when traffic load increase. This can be done with a wake-up call to the sleeping cell.\n\nRACH optimisation aims to minimise the number of attempts on the RACH channel, causing interference. The UE can be polled by the eNB for RACH statistics after connection. The number of preambles sent until successful RACH completion, and the number of contention resolution failure are in the statistics. But PRACH configuration parameters can also be distributed amongst eNBs, like zero correlation configuration, root sequence, high speed flag and PRACH frequency offset.\n\nFeatures for automatic detection and removal of failures and automatic adjustment of parameters are mainly specified in Release 10.\n\nCoverage and Capacity Optimization enables automatic correction of capacity problems depending on slowly changing environment, like seasonal variations.\n\nMinimization of drive tests (MDT), is enabling normal UEs to provide the same type of information as those collected in drive test. A great advantage is that UEs can retrieve and report parameters from indoor environments.",

LTE radio network dimensioning is typically optimized for data services. To avoid negative impacts on user experience for VoLTE subscribers in areas with weak LTE coverage, a handover to 2G or 3G is performed sooner, i.e. at a higher RSRP level, for UEs with established voice bearers compared to UEs with only data bearers.\n\nAs in the Technical Specification for Multimedia Telephony Service over IMS (MTSI), TS 26.114, which is used as basis for the GSMA IR.92 VoLTE profile, there have been several tools for increased robustness of speech calls with initial selection of Codecs and their Configuration and in-call dynamic rate and mode adaptation and application layer redundancy. EVS (Enhanced Voice Services), especially the EVS Channel Aware mode, demonstrates higher robustness against transmission errors than AMR and AMR-WB codecs.\n\nBased on the above provided background and depending on network dimensioning, which typically targets at data services, the VoLTE coverage may be a function of the selected codec and its configuration, its rate adaptation, and potentially the applied application layer redundancy, as well as the required QoS of the VoLTE bearer. It is adopted that a new QoS parameter Maximum Packet Loss Rate in UL and DL directions is defined and sent from PCRF to eNB. At reception of the IMS service information from the P-CSCF, if configured through policy, the PCRF determines the Maximum Packet Loss Rate for UL and DL based on the IMS service information e.g. codec and sends it to PCEF along with the PCC rule for the voice media. This parameter is transferred to the eNB to support it for handover threshold decision.\n\nBased on the analysis/evaluation of this eVoLP WID, the existing 3GPP 4G specifications TS 23.401, 23.203 and 5G specifications TS 23.501, 23.502, 23.503 have been modified according to it.\n\nReferences",

    "context": "https://www.sharetechnote.com/html/IoT/IoT_WhatToChoose.html\n\nIoT: What to choose\n\nNow let's assume that you got the full unstanding of each of the IoT related technology individually and did a little bit of categorization, you may come up with some daisy chain like diagram as illustrated below.\n\nWhat is confusing you would not be the technical details of each individual technology. What confuse you would about 'how one technology differs from other technologies ?' or 'which technology I have to chose for my application or use model ?'\n\nThe simple answer to the question \"Which technology do I have to pick for my application or my use model ?\" is \"It depends on the nature of your application\".\n\nI know.. you would not take this as an answer. You would ask for more specific answers.\n\nIf you want to get more specific answers, you would have specific answers to a lot of specific questions as listed below. (This list would get extended as learn/observe more from various discussions/forums).\n\nI would not put my comments on each of the questions for now.. just to give you some time for you to think.. (good excuse for my laziness :)).\n\nThis is basically asking about the data rate of the end node in your IoT system. Is it collecting a simple data like Temperature, Humidity which takes up only several bytes at a time of transmission. Normally this kind of IoT device should be very low cost. It is less likely to let this kind of device to use relatively expensive network (like cellular network).\n\nThis is asking 'Are you going to use a simple sensors (like temperature, humidity) ?' or some other devices which requires a relatively large packet transmission/reception or which requires very high level data security.\n\nThis would be highly related to Q1. Usually the type of data to be collected and transmitted would determine the necessary data rate, but there might be some exceptions. For example, if you need very sophisticated data security and add a lot of additional portions to the original data to implement the security, the data rate that you would need would get much higher. Another exception can be the case where you want to upgrade/reconfigure your end-node remotely. Of course, this would not happen very often but if you really want to do this, the data rate should be pretty high for the end-node to download necessary firmware and configuration information.\n\nQ4. Does your end node device will both transmit and receive data ? or only transmit the data (no recieve) ?\n\nMost of the IoT application is Uplink centeric (transmission only in terms of end-device) and in some extreme case there are some application that is uplink only. It is understandable for most of IoT application to be Uplink dominant but there would be a lot of restriction if it goes with uplink only. For example, you have a very simple end-device (e.g, a temperature sensor) and transmitted it to a Gateway or Basestation. If the device is uplink only (transmission only), the device can only transmit the data and there is no way to verify whther it successfully reached the destination or not. To verify the successful transmission of the data, there should be some mechanism by which the destination (e.g, Gateway) can send Acknowledge message to the device that has sent the data. To do this, the system should allow downlink (i.e, reception in terms of end-device). Also, if you want to apply any form of data security or remote re-configuration or remote update, you need both uplink and downlink.\n\nLet me ask another question before this .. Are you going to use unlicensed band/frequency (i.e ISM band) or a licensed band / frequency (e.g, Cellular) ? If you decided to use ISM band, it is highly likely to use sub Ghz band (i.e, around 900 Mhz) or around 2.4 Ghz frequency. If you decided to use licensed band, it will be determined by which frequency will be allowed in the area where your IoT system will be installed.\n\nIf you selected unlicensed band, you are free to use any of the frequency .. but it is not only you who is free to use the frequency.. there might be a lot of other devices that uses the same frequency which might cause unwanted interference. If you decided to use the licensed frequency, there will be licensing / permission issue.\n\nIf the transmitter and reciever is communicating within the range of couple of meters or tens of meters, you can use many of the existing short range communication like Bluetooth, ZigBee etc. However, if it should extend to several km or tens of km, you have to use those technologies that can cover wide range like LPWAN (e.g, LoRa, SigFox etc) or Cellular technology.\n\nBasically IoT requires a cirtain type of Network structure whether it is small or large (in most case it is not peer to peer communication). Then you would have question on how to form such a network and how much control you want to have over the whole network. Some people would say 'I want to implement only the end Node(e.g, terminal sensor module) and get it connected to an exisiting network that are already established'. In this case, you would consider Cellular based IoT or SigFox. In this option, you would have less work to do but very limitted or no controllability for network. Some people would say 'I want to implement everything from the end node to the network and I want to have full control over the network'. In this case, you may like LoRa type of technology. You would have full controllability, but downside is that there are a lot of works for you to do.\n\nFor example, SKT deployed a Nation wide IoT service in South Korea around the end of 2016 based on LoRa technology. According to Ref [5], they were considering LoRa, SigFox, NB-LTE(and other LTE based IoT). LTE IoT was excluded for other reason, but between LoRa and SigFox, the controllability to Network was one of the factor to select LoRa.\n\nQ10. Do you need any security for the data being transmitted and received ? At which level, if you need ?\n\nI personally think this is pretty important issue since there are many cases where it is not easy to change / upgrade the software of a IoT end node once it is installed or take too much cost to visit every installation points and change software of the device. However, I don't see this issues widely discussed in the industry yet (as of early 2017). Probably they are afraid to bring up the issues that does not have any simple / easy solution. In theory, the smartest solution is to let the end node device itself to download the new software and upgrade it by itself. We have seen this type of software upgrade in cellular phone (smart phone) pretty commonly these days. We may think of utilizing the similar technologies to IoT devices. However, the biggest problem would be the bandwidth. Most of IoT device is designed for low data rate communication, but this kind of wireless software upgrade would take pretty big bandwidth. So if you think of this kind of wireless software upgrade, you would need to choose such a technology to provide big enough bandwidth for wireless woftware upgrade.\n\nQ12. What kind of protocol (phy, mac, application layer protocol) do you want to use ?\n\nThere are many different technologies that claim to be the best for IoT. Some of them would already be available at your time of deployment, but some technologies would be being talked a lot but not available or not mature yet. So if your deployment schedule is very near, you would need to choose a technology that are mature right now.\n\nFor example, SKT deployed a Nation wide IoT service in South Korea around the end of 2016 based on LoRa technology. According to Ref [5], they were considering LoRa, SigFox, NB-LTE(and other LTE based IoT). SigFox were excluded for other reason, but between LoRa and SigFox, LoRa was selected mainly due to availability. LoRa technology was already there when they were planning, but there were still a couple of years to go for LTE based IoT to be mature enough.\n\n[3] NarrowBand IoT Demystified: What are the benefits and why do we need it?

    "context": "https://www.sharetechnote.com/html/Handbook_UMTS_eCall.html\n\n2G/3G: eCall\n\nWhat is 'eCall' ? In other words, you may ask 'what does the letter 'e' stands for ? Does it mean 'emergency' ? or 'electronic' ? or something else ?\n\nEven though I haven't seen any formal documents that explicitely defines the letter 'e' in eCall, I think it would not be wrong if you say the 'e' mean 'emergency', i.e, 'eCall' would mean 'emergency Call'. But this interpretation would confuse a lot of people. Then, how does eCall differ from what we normally call 'Emergency Call (like 911)' ?\n\nI will explain on the details of this difference later, but simply put, the biggest difference would be the usual 'Emergency call' is a kind of voice call between a human and Emergency Call Center (usually another person in Emergency Call Center)' but 'eCall' is a call between a machine (called IVS : In Vehicle System within an automobile) and Emergency Center;.\n\nFor the persons who likes formal definition, I would quote some descriptions from a couple of international standards as follows :\n\neCall is a manually or automatically initiated emergency call, (TS12 : teleServiceCode 12) from a vehicle, supplemented with a minimum set of emergency related data (MSD), as defined under the EU Commission's eSafety initiative\n\neCall provides reliable full-duplex data communications between IVS and PSAP in addition to emergency voice call (E112) via the cellular network, and can be initiated either automatically or manually. The eCall In-band Modem uses the same voice channel as used for the emergency voice call. eCall allows reliable transmission of MSD alternating with a speech conversation through the existing voice communication paths in cellular mobile phone systems. The expected benefit is that emergency services will be made aware of accidents much more rapidly, will get precise information on location, vehicle type etc. and therefore will be able to reach accident victims faster, with the potential to save many lives annually.\n\nBefore we talk of the technical details of eCall, let's take a 10000-feet overview (high level view) on how eCall go through. You may find a lot of illustrations, cartoons on eCall from internet and following is my own version of illustration. I put the number labels on each of the steps and I would put a short descriptions on what's happening at each step.\n\n(2) eCall is triggered. eCall can be triggered in many ways. It can be triggered automatically by Air Bag or internal sensors. Or a person (e.g, driver) in the car can push the emergency button in the car to trigger the eCall.\n\n(3) The eCall device installed in the car (called IVS : In-Vehicle System) go through Emergency Voice Call setup process to establish the voice call channel. Once the voice call channel is established, the IVS send eCall Data (MSD : Minimal Set of Data) to PSAP (Public Safety Answering Point)\n\n(4) Once the eCall Data(MSD) is received by PSAP, the information would show up automatically on the screen at PSAP center.\n\n(5) The personnel at PSAP center may try voice contact to the person in the car if possible. But there would be many cases where this is not possible when person in the car is injured badly.\n\nFor those who came from Cellular protocol and new to eCall, it would be a little confusing on figuring out the difference between eCall and another type of Emergency Call (like 911 in North America) which we are familiar with in daily life. For those people, I think it would be easier / clearer to explain the difference in terms of overall protocol sequence. Following is my understanding (the image formed in my brain when I first got trained about this).\n\nAs you see here in the following illustration, there is common portions and different portions between eCall and Emergency Call.\n\nNOTE : IVS stands for In-Vehicle System. It is the eCall / Cellular module that are installed within Car (within Telematics module in most case). In terms of testing, this is a DUT\n\neCall Higher Layer Application Protocol (HLAP) is very simple (at least comparting to Cellular Protocol). Actually there is only one critical data to be transferred. The critical data is called MSD(Minimal Set of Data). All the remaining part is just to get MSD delivered to PSAP (Emergency Call Center) with reliability.\n\nAs in Cellular Voice Call, in HLAP there are two different type of call mode depending on who (IVS or PSAP) initiates call. The eCall initiated by IVS is called 'PUSH mode' and this is similar concept as MO(Mobile Originating) call in cellular voice call.\n\nThe eCall initiated by PSAP is called 'PULL mode' and this is similar concept as MT(Mobile Terminating) call in cellular voice call.\n\nThe two illustrations in this section is based on ETSI 103.428 Figure 2. The ETSI diagram is a single diagram showing both PUSH and PULL mode in single sequence. It looked a little confusing to me, so I split the digram into two separate diagram as shown below.\n\nNOTE 1 : IVS stands for In-Vehicle System. It is the eCall / Cellular module that are installed within Car (within Telematics module in most case). In terms of testing, this is a DUT\n\nNOTE 2 : PSAP stands for Public Safety Answering Point. This is a kind of Emergency Call Center.\n\nPSAP PUSH Mode Call is like MO call in celluar terminology. This is the call initiated by IVS (the mobile unit installed inside the car). I think in most case of eCall, the eCall goes in PUSH mode as illustrated below.\n\nPSAP PUSH Mode Call is like MT call in celluar terminology. This is the call initiated by PSAP (the call center). If you compare this with PUSH mode sequence, you would notice that most of the part are same. The only difference is the SEND-MSD (START) signal before the Initiation signal. This is also very much like cellular protocol. If you compare the MO Call and MT Call sequence in cellular protocol, you would notice that most part of the two are almost same. The main difference is that in MT Call the cellular network send 'Paging' (a kind of trigger for UE to initiate the call).\n\nAnother sequence that illustrate the eCall process with a little low layer point of view (especially in terms of LL/HL ACK operation) is shown below. This applies to both PUSH and PULL model.\n\n< ETSI TR 126.969 - Figure 1: Timeline of eCall with IVS initiated signalling and HL-ACK in normal operation >\n\nThere are various timers in eCall protocol which should be met in order to guarantee the normal functionality of the eCall. Some of these timers are an important criterial of testing eCall functionality.\n\nAs mentioned above, the only one fundamental goal for eCall is to deliver MSD(Minimal Set of Data) with reliability. Then you may ask what kind of information is in the MSD. High level description of the imformation in MSD can be find from following description. As you see, the most important information in the MSD is the location data and vehicle information.\n\nThe eCall modem allows to transfer a data message from the IVS over the cellular network to the PSAP which is denoted as eCall MSD. The MSD can include, e.g. vehicle location information, time stamp, number of passengers, Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), and other relevant accident information\n\nThe Minimum Set of Data forming the data component of an eCall sent from a vehicle to a Public Safety Answering Point or other designated emergency call centre. The MSD has a maximum size of 140 bytes and includes, for example, vehicle identity, location information and time-stamp.\n\nBefore we think of this, let's think of why we need to care of this. We should care of this because eCall signaling message and data are delivered in the form of Voice call data of GSM or WCDMA cellular network.\n\nIn GSM / WCDMA, various different types of codecs are used. Basically the codec selection is a job for the specific Radio Access Network equipment(RAN Equipment) that is communicating with the eCall device. The RAN Equipment (Network) would select the codec that would give the best performance in a specific situation. 'Performance' mean 'How fast the eCall data can be delivered' and 'How reliably it can be delivered under a specific channel condition'. It would be too much (or too boring) to present the full details on these performance here. If you are really interested in the details, refer to ETSI TR 126.969 and it would give you a lot of test data for various different Codecs.\n\nIn theory, you can use a live network and PSAP Simulator to test your eCall Device (IVS). But theory is just a theory. You would come across a lot of issues to overcome if you go for this option even though I cannot say it is impossible.\n\nAnother way of testing the eCall device is to construct test setup as described in ETSI 103.428 section 6 Test Configurations. In this document, it is described to use a private cellular network for various Interoperability and Conformance Testing.\n\nThe most practical solution (Test setup) that will be used in the industry would be to use Cellular Network Simulator and PSAP simulator as illustrated below.\n\nAssuming that you have a test setup and you need to determine what to test. As in most of other wireless and cellular device device, you may think of general test that tend to happen during the development or system integration stage. We often call these test in various different name such as function test, integration test or smoke test etc. Usually test specification / procedure tend not to be clearly defined or the procedure changes often depending on situations. Also those test procedure / test item may vary depending on manufacturer. Therefore, it would not be easy to clearly define on what to test for this stage. However, if you just take a close look at the overall eCall protocol, you would easily guess high level test items even without looking into any specification. My personal version of the guess work about the first level test are shown below. You may come up with different idea, but I don't think there would be any big difference between your idea and my idea.\n\nOnce you complete the general function test during development and system integration level and have a stable device, you would forward the device to conformance test. Once you are at the stage of conformance test, you don't have to worry about what to test because a lot of other people (standard body) put a lot of effort and energy and came out with well defined document. In 3GPP/ETSI, those test procedures are defined in ETSI TS 103.428.\n\nAfter completing the conformance, if you are trying to sell the device (acutually Automakers trying to sell cars) in a specific region (e.g, Europe, Asia, America etc), you may need to go through a specific set of test cases specified by the regulatory body in that specific region.\n\nFollowings are the examples of how eCall is being testing during the development or for conformance test before commercialization.\n\nFollowings are the list of the specifications for eCall. I think the most fundamental specifications are CEN documents. But it is not free to get those spec. Recently 3GPP / ETSI has released various specifications. I think most part of the 3GPP specification are based on CEN specification.\n\n: Describes mostly on physical/transport layer design and process of transmitter and reciever.\n\n: This documents describes on API and parameter descriptions of eCall modem protocol stack. It describes on overall software architecture and API prototype but not show the function body. Unless you are developing the protocol stack, you would not need to read this spec.\n\n: This documents describes general logics on eCall Test, but it does not specifies any specific test cases or details of protocol sequence. If you are interested in physical / transport layer level testing, this document would help you to catch the overall test concept.\n\n: If you are interested in high level protocol and function test, this document would help a lot. It shows overall protocol sequence of eCall and decfines specific test sequences. Most of the test in this document (as of V1.1.1 (2016-06)) are based on CEN EN 16062:2015\n\nRoad transport and traffic telematics eSafety eCall minimum set of data - Draft EN 081018\n\nIntelligent transport systems eSafety - Pan European eCall - Operating requirements",

    "context": "https://www.sharetechnote.com/html/Handbook_UMTS_eCall.html\n\n2G/3G: eCall\n\nWhat is 'eCall' ? In other words, you may ask 'what does the letter 'e' stands for ? Does it mean 'emergency' ? or 'electronic' ? or something else ?\n\nEven though I haven't seen any formal documents that explicitely defines the letter 'e' in eCall, I think it would not be wrong if you say the 'e' mean 'emergency', i.e, 'eCall' would mean 'emergency Call'. But this interpretation would confuse a lot of people. Then, how does eCall differ from what we normally call 'Emergency Call (like 911)' ?\n\nI will explain on the details of this difference later, but simply put, the biggest difference would be the usual 'Emergency call' is a kind of voice call between a human and Emergency Call Center (usually another person in Emergency Call Center)' but 'eCall' is a call between a machine (called IVS : In Vehicle System within an automobile) and Emergency Center;.\n\nFor the persons who likes formal definition, I would quote some descriptions from a couple of international standards as follows :\n\neCall is a manually or automatically initiated emergency call, (TS12 : teleServiceCode 12) from a vehicle, supplemented with a minimum set of emergency related data (MSD), as defined under the EU Commission's eSafety initiative\n\neCall provides reliable full-duplex data communications between IVS and PSAP in addition to emergency voice call (E112) via the cellular network, and can be initiated either automatically or manually. The eCall In-band Modem uses the same voice channel as used for the emergency voice call. eCall allows reliable transmission of MSD alternating with a speech conversation through the existing voice communication paths in cellular mobile phone systems. The expected benefit is that emergency services will be made aware of accidents much more rapidly, will get precise information on location, vehicle type etc. and therefore will be able to reach accident victims faster, with the potential to save many lives annually.\n\nBefore we talk of the technical details of eCall, let's take a 10000-feet overview (high level view) on how eCall go through. You may find a lot of illustrations, cartoons on eCall from internet and following is my own version of illustration. I put the number labels on each of the steps and I would put a short descriptions on what's happening at each step.\n\n(2) eCall is triggered. eCall can be triggered in many ways. It can be triggered automatically by Air Bag or internal sensors. Or a person (e.g, driver) in the car can push the emergency button in the car to trigger the eCall.\n\n(3) The eCall device installed in the car (called IVS : In-Vehicle System) go through Emergency Voice Call setup process to establish the voice call channel. Once the voice call channel is established, the IVS send eCall Data (MSD : Minimal Set of Data) to PSAP (Public Safety Answering Point)\n\n(4) Once the eCall Data(MSD) is received by PSAP, the information would show up automatically on the screen at PSAP center.\n\n(5) The personnel at PSAP center may try voice contact to the person in the car if possible. But there would be many cases where this is not possible when person in the car is injured badly.\n\nFor those who came from Cellular protocol and new to eCall, it would be a little confusing on figuring out the difference between eCall and another type of Emergency Call (like 911 in North America) which we are familiar with in daily life. For those people, I think it would be easier / clearer to explain the difference in terms of overall protocol sequence. Following is my understanding (the image formed in my brain when I first got trained about this).\n\nAs you see here in the following illustration, there is common portions and different portions between eCall and Emergency Call.\n\nNOTE : IVS stands for In-Vehicle System. It is the eCall / Cellular module that are installed within Car (within Telematics module in most case). In terms of testing, this is a DUT\n\neCall Higher Layer Application Protocol (HLAP) is very simple (at least comparting to Cellular Protocol). Actually there is only one critical data to be transferred. The critical data is called MSD(Minimal Set of Data). All the remaining part is just to get MSD delivered to PSAP (Emergency Call Center) with reliability.\n\nAs in Cellular Voice Call, in HLAP there are two different type of call mode depending on who (IVS or PSAP) initiates call. The eCall initiated by IVS is called 'PUSH mode' and this is similar concept as MO(Mobile Originating) call in cellular voice call.\n\nThe eCall initiated by PSAP is called 'PULL mode' and this is similar concept as MT(Mobile Terminating) call in cellular voice call.\n\nThe two illustrations in this section is based on ETSI 103.428 Figure 2. The ETSI diagram is a single diagram showing both PUSH and PULL mode in single sequence. It looked a little confusing to me, so I split the digram into two separate diagram as shown below.\n\nNOTE 1 : IVS stands for In-Vehicle System. It is the eCall / Cellular module that are installed within Car (within Telematics module in most case). In terms of testing, this is a DUT\n\nNOTE 2 : PSAP stands for Public Safety Answering Point. This is a kind of Emergency Call Center.\n\nPSAP PUSH Mode Call is like MO call in celluar terminology. This is the call initiated by IVS (the mobile unit installed inside the car). I think in most case of eCall, the eCall goes in PUSH mode as illustrated below.\n\nPSAP PUSH Mode Call is like MT call in celluar terminology. This is the call initiated by PSAP (the call center). If you compare this with PUSH mode sequence, you would notice that most of the part are same. The only difference is the SEND-MSD (START) signal before the Initiation signal. This is also very much like cellular protocol. If you compare the MO Call and MT Call sequence in cellular protocol, you would notice that most part of the two are almost same. The main difference is that in MT Call the cellular network send 'Paging' (a kind of trigger for UE to initiate the call).\n\nAnother sequence that illustrate the eCall process with a little low layer point of view (especially in terms of LL/HL ACK operation) is shown below. This applies to both PUSH and PULL model.\n\n< ETSI TR 126.969 - Figure 1: Timeline of eCall with IVS initiated signalling and HL-ACK in normal operation >\n\nThere are various timers in eCall protocol which should be met in order to guarantee the normal functionality of the eCall. Some of these timers are an important criterial of testing eCall functionality.\n\nAs mentioned above, the only one fundamental goal for eCall is to deliver MSD(Minimal Set of Data) with reliability. Then you may ask what kind of information is in the MSD. High level description of the imformation in MSD can be find from following description. As you see, the most important information in the MSD is the location data and vehicle information.\n\nThe eCall modem allows to transfer a data message from the IVS over the cellular network to the PSAP which is denoted as eCall MSD. The MSD can include, e.g. vehicle location information, time stamp, number of passengers, Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), and other relevant accident information\n\nThe Minimum Set of Data forming the data component of an eCall sent from a vehicle to a Public Safety Answering Point or other designated emergency call centre. The MSD has a maximum size of 140 bytes and includes, for example, vehicle identity, location information and time-stamp.\n\nBefore we think of this, let's think of why we need to care of this. We should care of this because eCall signaling message and data are delivered in the form of Voice call data of GSM or WCDMA cellular network.\n\nIn GSM / WCDMA, various different types of codecs are used. Basically the codec selection is a job for the specific Radio Access Network equipment(RAN Equipment) that is communicating with the eCall device. The RAN Equipment (Network) would select the codec that would give the best performance in a specific situation. 'Performance' mean 'How fast the eCall data can be delivered' and 'How reliably it can be delivered under a specific channel condition'. It would be too much (or too boring) to present the full details on these performance here. If you are really interested in the details, refer to ETSI TR 126.969 and it would give you a lot of test data for various different Codecs.\n\nIn theory, you can use a live network and PSAP Simulator to test your eCall Device (IVS). But theory is just a theory. You would come across a lot of issues to overcome if you go for this option even though I cannot say it is impossible.\n\nAnother way of testing the eCall device is to construct test setup as described in ETSI 103.428 section 6 Test Configurations.

This could result in interference and issues with mobility. This WI aimed to address such issues. Below is a description of the enhancements introduced as part of this WI.\n\nTS 36.331 was extended with two reporting events H1 and H2. With these two new events, the UE triggers a height report when the UE's altitude is above(H1) or below(H2) of an eNB-configured threshold. Further, the RRM measurement framework was extended such that the UE can be configured to trigger a measurement report if an event condition is met for a configurable number of cells. Events applicable for this enhancement are A3, A4 and A5. These enhancements help the eNB to determine that a UE is flying and/or allow to detect that the UE may be causing or experiencing interference.\n\nTo improve mobility performance, RRC signalling was added to allow the UE to indicate to the eNB the planned flight path. More specifically, the UE can indicate where the UE is planned to be in the future which could be taken into account by the eNB for mobility purposes, e.g. the eNB may be able to use this information to know in advance which cell would be suitable for the UE to be handed over to and if a new X2 connection is beneficial to be established.\n\nIn some countries it may not be allowed to fly drones which are connected to LTE network without authorization. In order for the network to know if the user of the UE has a suitable subscription, a signalling from the CN to the eNB was introduced with information about whether the subscription supports Aerial UE function. How the eNB uses this information was left for implementation.\n\nTo reduce possible uplink interference, UL power control enhancements were specified allowing for UE-specific fractional pathloss compensation factor, and the range of the UE specific P0 parameter was also extended.\n\nFor more details please refer to the status report [3] and associated CRs [4-5].\n\nReferences",

This is mainly designed to use LTE for M2M (Machine to Machine) or IoT (Internet of Things). Usually these application requires not that much throughput (in most case it needs very low throughput).\n\nWhy do you need this kind of special technique ? Does this mean that current LTE cannot achieve such a low throughput ?\n\nOf course there is no problem with the current LTE to work for such a low throughput application. But the issue is not with the low throughput, but with some other constraints. In practical point of view, this kind of application would need following characterstics.\n\nAs I said there is no problem with achieving Low Throughput with the current LTE implementation, but there would be limitation to achieve Low Cost, Low Energy Consumption as required in this area (Actually Low Throughput itself is not a goal of the design. It is more like a result of design/implementation that meets MTC criteria illustrated below.\n\nThen how to achieve these critical requirement. The easies way we can think of is to reduce the complexity of LTE and this is the main motivation of MTC and it is one of major topics in Rel 13. I think this would be more important feature/topic in 5G than in 4G (Current LTE).\n\nYou may say 'item i) and ii) has been supported from the day 1 of LTE. So we don't have to do anything (effort /changes) on network side ?'\n\nOnly in terms of throughput in a good signal condition, you may say like it. But with BW 1.4 and single antenna, it is very difficult to apply techniques to improve the reliable data connection (e.g, Spatial Diversity, Frequency Diversity etc). So we may need to change some specification to compensate this restriction.\n\nAlso, we may need to change some lower layer specification due to item iii) as well.\n\nAs of now (Apr 2015), no TS document yet, but you can get pretty details information from following documents.\n\nNow (as of Rel 13) we can see the real implementation of these criteria because LTE MTC specification is released.

The untruncated name and some of the metadata are to be retrieved from authoritative data sources by the terminating service provider.\n\nDescription\n\neCNAM does not deliver messages from the originator across multiple networks to the terminating user. eCNAM is a service that resides in the terminating service provider's (SP) network, most likely in the Telephony Application Server (TAS). However, it utilizes the identity information received in SIP signalling.\n\nThe untruncated name is delivered in the \"display-name\" parameter of the From header field and/or P-Asserted-Identity header field that the terminating Application Server sends to the terminating UE.\n\nThe metadata will be delivered in one or more Call-Info header field(s). The eCNAM service logic in the AS assembles and formats several data elements (subject to local policy). eCNAM metadata may include type of call, location of a business, or language of the originator. Furthermore, eCNAM metadata may include the results of robocalling analytics that are used to alert the subscriber of possible scams. Typically, service providers partner with analytics providers that offer risk indicators about incoming calls (e.g., known scammers). The results of such analytics are relayed to the user in the form of text strings and/or icons to be displayed on his/her UE. The eCNAM Call-Info header fields support the delivery of text and icons. Given the changing nature of scams, the results of the analytics are expected to vary. eCNAM provides the advantage of a flexible \"envelope\" - namely the Call-Info header field(s) - that delivers different types of payload without having to modify existing standards frequently.\n\nReferences",

It is mainly for 5G Radio System. Even though no 3GPP specification about 5G is available, this project will contribute a lot in 5G community. Refer to OpenAirInterface home page for the details.\n\nOpenAirInterface (OAI) Software Alliance aims to further the software towards future 3GPP releases for 5G. The main goal of the alliance is to create an ecosystem of industrial/non-profit/academic organizations to implement reference solution for 3GPP standards. The OAI is striving to become a tool used by both the industry and academic for using community driven development to accelerate innovation in 5G wireless technologies, and to bring the huge economic success to this part of information technology. The OAI targets a reference implementation of Release 14 LTE based on the current 4G implementation and to progressively add enhancements from 3GPP study items defining the future 5G standard.\n\nOpenAirInterface is an open source implementation of 3GPP stack. It covers different parts of 3GPP stack (eNodeB, UE, MME, HSS, S-GW, P-GW). The software runs on general purpose computing platform (for ex. Intel/ARM) and interfaces with wide variety of SDR platforms (EXMIMO, USRP, BladeRF, LimeSDR).\n\nThe OAI currently implements Rel 8/10 stack for eNB/UE/EPC. It runs on standard Ubuntu Linux 14.04 LTS with low-latency kernel for eNB/UE. OAI requires Intel processors which support (SSE3/SSE4), however support for AVX2 is optional. It is also a requirement to have USB3/PCIe on a PC which interfaces with SDR platforms (USRP, BladeRF, EXMIMO and LimeSDR). The code compiles with standard GNU toolchain that comes with Linux. OAI can be also run in simulation mode (oaisim), the details of which are provided by Open Air Usage tutorials on the gitlab server@EURECOM.\n\nThe OAI software packages used to deploy an operators core network, the Enhanced Packet Core or EPC, are collectively known as openairCN while the access network software for base stations and terminals goes under the name of openair5G.\n\nThe EPC is quickly being integrated with other open source software packages providing telecommunication services and solutions for network management (e.g. openIMS, Clearwater IMS, OpenDayLight, Open Source MANO (OSM), OpNFV) on the generic cloud computing platform OpenStack. To ease integration with OpenStack software packages, and because revenues from the EPC are less dependent on intellectual property agreements, openairCN is distributed with a standard Apache V2.0 license, which is quite common in cloud computing software. The access network software openair5G, on the other hand, is freely distributed by the OAI under the terms stipulated by a new open source licence, the OAI Public License, catering to the intellectual property agreements used in 3GPP and allowing contributions from 3GPP members holding patents on key procedures used in the standard. The OAI is working closely with ETSI to harmonise the software licence with the intellectual property policy of 3GPP. The end result is that groups can use the software as any Apache V2.0 software for non-commercial purposes (e.g. for study and research) while for commercial exploitation of the community software, users are bound to respect intellectual property agreements associated with the 3GPP standard as with proprietary hardware and software. For details on OAI licensing model, please refer to OAI License Model page.\n\nSince, the evolution of 5G is still under discussion within academia/industry, we plan to identify different areas in which different members of the alliance create projects. The projects are created with the goal of furthering these strategic areas within the alliance and making sure the output of the project is merged back with the main repository at some point. The strategic areas of the alliance ratified by the board are listed here.\n\nIn order to install OAI successfully, it is important to follow HW/SW requirements. Almost all the technical documentation is hosted on EURECOM gitlab server. The entry point for wiki for openair5G is OAI Wiki/Home and the entry point for openairCN is OAI-CN Wiki/Home is here. There are several tutorials inside Gitlab page to run OAI in various modes (Emulation, Simulation, real-time with COTS UE, etc). The mailing lists for both user and developer community is OAI Wiki/Mailinglist. The gitlab workflow/coding guidelines/contributing guidelines are here.\n\nOAI hosts several training/workshops periodically for roadmap discussions with the community and also to train the community regarding the software implementation. For more information, refer to OAI Community/Workshop.\n\nThe Alliance offers several membership models for companies, non-profit institutions and individual contributors. The membership is free for individuals/non-profit organizations, however there is fee for corporations. For more info regarding membership, refer to OSA/JoinUs.\n\nQ2. Is there any operating system requirement ? (What type of linux ? what version ? etc) What is Operating System details that has been verified by OAI developers.\n\nQ4. What kind of hardware can be used to run OAI and what are those which has been verified by OAI developer ?\n\nQ4-1. Would OAI be runnable on USRP Embedded Sieries ? (Any verification activity done ?)\n\n[Ans] Yes, but we have not tried it. OAI needs to be ported to ZynQ to run on USRP Embedded series.\n\nQ4-2.There are many different series of USRP. Is there any specific series/model that is not usable for OAI ? (In terms of performance etc)\n\n[Ans] It is not recommended to use USRP N series as it is not able to do LTE sampling rate (30.72 for 20 MHz). In order to use USRP N-series, LTE sampling rate needs to be implemented in software on a PC\n\nQ5. Is there any additional libraries or tools that are required to OAI stack ? (e.g, GNU Radio or FFTW etc)\n\n[Ans] There are additional libraries required but they are installed automatically by OAI scripts (Refer to OAI Autobuild for details).\n\nQ7. Is it possible to develop use OAI as software simulator without hardware ? (Like Matlab LTE toolbox)\n\n[Ans] Yes, it has a simulation mode called oaisim (Refer to OIA Wiki/OpenAirUsage for details).\n\n[Ans] 5 Mhz and 10 Mhz has been most extensively tested as of now (Apr 2016) and 20 MHz is close to being released as well, but theoretically it should work with all bands\n\nQ10. What is the maximum MCS and maximum RB that has been proved working (for 5Mhz, 10 Mhz BW) in OAI system ?",

    "context": "6.2.2\tIntra-3G_MSC GSM to UMTS Handover\n\nThe procedure for a successful Intra-3G_MSC handover is shown in figure 9. It is assumed that selection of a candidate UE/MS has already taken place within the BSC based upon the criteria presented in clause 5. The exact algorithm, in the BSC, for determining a candidate UE/MS is not addressed in the present document. The procedures discussed do not make use of the Mobile Application Part (MAP), represented by signalling function 4 in figures 4 and 6. The procedure described in this clause covers case ii).\nIn case of subsequent handover the following applies. If 3G_MSC-B supports location reporting at change of Service Area and if encapsulated BSSAP signalling is used on the E-interface, 3G_MSC-B shall always initiate the Location Reporting Control procedure at change of Service Area towards the target RNS since no request for Location Reporting can be received from MSC-A. In that case, the Location Reporting Control procedure shall be initiated by 3G_MSC-B after the Relocation Resource Allocation procedure has been executed successfully.\n\nThe change of Service Area shall be reported to MSC-A within an A-HANDOVER-PERFORMED message.\nIn the case of ongoing voice group calls, the handover does not take place since voice group calls are not supported in UMTS.\nThe successful operation of the procedure is as follows. When the BSS (BSS-A), currently supporting the UE, determines that the UE requires to be handed over to UMTS it will send an AHANDOVER-REQUIRED message to the 3G_MSC (3G_MSCA). The A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message shall contain a single cell, to which the UE can be handed over. When the 3G_MSCA receives the A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message it shall begin the process of handing over the UE to a new RNS (RNS-B). The 3G_MSCA shall generate an Iu-RELOCATION-REQUEST message to the selected RNS (RNS-B). For handover of a speech call to UTRAN Iu mode, 3G_MSC-A shall include a NAS Synch Indicator in the Iu-RELOCATION-REQUEST message.\n\nIf 3G_MSC-A supports inter-system handover to a CSG cell and BSS-A includes a CSG ID for the target cell in the A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message, then 3G_MSC-A shall check the CSG membership of the UE for the target cell as described in subclause 4.3.1 before generating the Iu-RELOCATION-REQUEST message. If the UE fails the CSG membership check and the target cell is a CSG cell, 3G_MSC-A shall send an A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED-REJECT to BSS-A.\nWhen RNS-B receives the Iu-RELOCATION-REQUEST message it shall take the necessary action to allow the UE to access the radio resource of RNS-B, this is detailed in the 3GPP TS 25.300 series and the 3GPP TS 25.200 series of 3GPP Technical Specifications. The switching of the radio resource through the necessary terrestrial resources is detailed in the 3GPP TS 25.430 series and 3GPP TS 25.413.\n\nOnce resource allocation has been completed by RNS-B, it shall return an Iu-RELOCATION-REQUEST-ACK. to 3G_MSCA. When this message is received by 3G_MSCA it shall begin the process of instructing the UE to tune to a new dedicated radio resource. An A-HANDOVER-COMMAND will be sent by the 3G_MSCA to BSS-A. On receipt of the A-HANDOVER-COMMAND message BSS-A will send the radio interface message RI-HANDOVER-COMMAND. The UE will then access the new radio resource. On detection of the UE, the RNS-B shall send an Iu-RELOCATION-DETECT to 3G_MSCA. When the UE is successfully communicating with the RNS-B an RRC-HANDOVER-COMPLETE message will be sent by the UE to RNS-B. The RNS-B will then send an Iu-RELOCATION-COMPLETE message to 3G_MSCA.\nAfter 3G_MSCA has received the Iu-RELOCATION-COMPLETE message from RNS-B, it shall begin to release the resources allocated on BSS-A. In figure 9 the resource is released by using the ACLEAR-COMMAND sequence.\n\nIf a failure occurs during the handover attempt, for example, A-HANDOVER-FAILURE returned from BSS-A or IuRELOCATION FAILURE returned from RNS-B, then 3G_MSCA will terminate the handover to RNS-B. Under these conditions 3G_MSCA may optionally take one of a number of actions:\nThe exact action taken is dependent on whether the failure occurs before or after the A-HANDOVER-COMMAND has been sent.\nIn all cases the existing connection to the UE shall not be cleared except in the case of expiry of the timer for receipt of Iu-RELOCATION-COMPLETE.\nDuring the period that the UE is not in communication with the network 3G_MSCA shall queue all appropriate messages. All messages shall be delivered to the UE once communication is resumed. In the case of an Intra-3G_MSC GSM to UMTS handover on 3G_MSCB then the messages shall be queued by 3G_MSCB.",

Below follows an overview of these procedures.\n3.6.1.1\tLocation updating procedure\nThis procedure is used when an MS registers with a Visitor Location Register.\nThe VLR provides its address to the HLR.\nThe VLR may also allocate an optional identity for the MS at location updating: the Local Mobile Station Identity (see 3GPP TS 23.003).\n3.6.1.2\tDownloading of subscriber parameters to the VLR\nAs a part of the location updating procedure, the Home Location Register will convey the subscriber parameters of the MS which need to be known by the visitor location register for proper call handling. This procedure is also used whenever there is a change in the subscriber parameters that need to be conveyed to the VLR (e.g. change in subscription, a change in supplementary services activation status).\n\nIf the HPLMN applies the multinumbering option, different MSISDNs are allocated for different Basic Services (see 3GPP TS 29.007) and stored in the HLR. Among these MSISDNs, the Basic MSISDN Indicator as part of the HLR subscriber data (see 3GPP TS 23.008) marks the 'Basic MSISDN' to be sent to the VLR at location update. It is used in the VLR for call handling as calling party and as line identity.\nIf the HPLMN applies the Administrative Restriction of Subscribers' Access feature, the HLR shall convey the subscriber access restriction parameter (AccessRestrictionData) to the VLR. The VLR shall check this subscription parameter against the radio access technology that supports the LA/RA in which the UE is roaming to decide whether the location update should be allowed or rejected.\nFor further information of the Subscriber access restriction see 3GPP TS 23.008.\n\n3.6.1.3\tLocation cancellation procedure\nThe procedure is used by the home location register to remove a MS from a visitor location register. The procedure will normally be used when the MS has moved to an area controlled by a different location register. The procedure can also be used in other cases, e.g. an MS ceases to be a subscriber of the Home PLMN.\n3.6.1.4\tMobile subscriber purging procedure\nA VLR may purge the subscriber data for an MS which has not established radio contact for a period determined by the network operator. Purging means to delete the subscriber data and to \"freeze\" the TMSI that has been allocated to the purged MS in order to avoid double TMSI allocation. The VLR shall inform the HLR of the purging.\nWhen the HLR is informed of the purging, it shall set the flag \"MS purged\" in the IMSI record of the MS concerned. Presence of the \"MS purged\" flag will cause any request for routing information for a call or short message to the MS to be treated as if the MS were not reachable.\n\nIn the VLR, the \"frozen\" TMSI is freed for usage in the TMSI allocation procedure by location updating for the purged MS in the same VLR, location cancellation for the purged MS or, in exceptional cases, by O&M.\nIn the HLR, the \"MS purged\" flag is reset by the location updating procedure and after reload of data from the non-volatile back-up that is performed when the HLR restarts after a failure.\n3.6.1.5\tSupport for subscription without MSISDN\nAn MSC/VLR may support delivery of SMS destined to an MS without MSISDN for GPRS and EPS operation whereby a MSISDN is not allocated as part of the subscription data (see 3GPP TS 23.060 subclause 5.3.17 and 3GPP TS 23.401).\nAn MSC/VLR which supports MSISDN-less operation shall indicate such support to the HLR in the MAP Update Location request.\nThe HLR should reject a MAP Update Location request received for an MSISDN-less subscription from a VLR not indicating support of MSISDN-less operation, with a cause indicating that roaming is not allowed.",

A fallback operation to the legacy timing of n+4 is still supported by scheduling from the common search space (CSS), while the short processing time is applicable when scheduling from the user-specific search space (USS). The fallback results in possible collision between n+4 and n+3 timing in different/same DL subframe and/or same/different UL subframe. For example, the use of fallback results in possible uplink collision in the PUCCH format 1/1a/1b resource usage for the same UE when the two DL subframes have been scheduled targeting HARQ feedback in the same UL subframe. Collision handling has been specified to ensure a consistent UE behaviour.\n\nShort processing time is configured per component carrier (CC) by RRC and applies to both DL assignment to HARQ feedback and UL grant to UL transmission.\n\nShort processing time is associated with asynchronous HARQ operation on the UL, and hence PHICH is no longer considered for HARQ feedback of n+3 based scheduling (PHICH is still used for synchronous n+4 based scheduling). HARQ processes on DL are shared between n+4 and n+3 based scheduling, while there is no sharing of HARQ processes between synchronous (n+4) and asynchronous (n+3) HARQ on the UL. The HARQ content for a given UL subframe m can consist of HARQ bits for n+3 carriers as well as HARQ bits for n+4 carriers at the same time.\n\nSimilar to HARQ, shortened processing time also applies to CSI, so that a UE configured with shortened processing time for 1ms TTI will measure CSI on a reference resource no less than 3 subframes away (nCQI_ref greater or equal to 3) from the CSI report. For TM10, the legacy value of the delay between the CSI reference and the CSI report is reduced by 1 subframe (nCQI_ref = legacy value -1).\n\nSRS timing for UE configured with Short processing time is such that for a trigger received in subframe n, aperiodic SRS is transmitted in the first available subframe n+3 or later, subject to the given UL subframe being configured for SRS transmission.\n\nWhen the processing time is shortened, the timing advance takes up a proportionally larger part of the overall processing time available to the UE. A consequence of this is that the maximum timing advance for a CC configured with short processing time is reduced from 667 us to 200 us.",

Tech.: Equalizer\n\nIn wireless communication (actually in any communication), the signal always go through a physical medium (mostly air and anything outside of the transmitter antenna in wirelss communication) before it reaches the reciever. In most cases, these channels tend not to be in the best environement for the signal and put some negative impact on the signal. As a result, the reciever would get the signal that is distorted or corrupted by the channel as illustrated below.\n\nIf the distortion or corruption by the channel gets too serious, proper communication cannot happen. Then, how can we ensure that the transmitted signal(data) can be properly recieved(decoded) by the reciever even when the signal is distorted or corrupted by the wireless channel ? One most common solution is to use a special component called Equalizer. This component can be in the form of hardware or software or both. Equalizer is a special component(a block) that can UNDO the distortion / corruption done by channel while the signal pass through the channel.\n\nIt may sound like a magic when you first heard of what the equalizer do and may ask yourself how such a magic can happen.\n\nTo explain on this, I would translate the block diagram shown in previous section into a mathematical format as shown below. (If you want to know about further details on H in this equation, refer to channel model page).\n\nAs I mentioned above, usally the H distorts or corrupt the signal which make it difficult for the reciever to decode the signal. The goal is to undo the effect of H. Mathematical point of view, it is very simple. Just take the inverse of H (channel) and apply it to the received signal (Hx). Basically what Equalizer do is to calculate the inverse of channel matrix and correct (compensate) the received signal.\n\nAs everybody in the engineering would know, there is nothing as easy as said. Same applies to Equalization as well. As mentioned in previous section, ideally Equalization is just to take the inverse of channel matrix and applies it to the received signal, but there are some mathematical and technical chalenges and preconditions.\n\nTo obtain the inverse of the channel matrix, the channel matrix should satisfy specific conditions as follows.\n\nTo overcome these mathmatical restriction, we use many other techniques that can applies to non square matrix. Most of the commonly used Equalization method like least squre, SVD, MMSE can be applied to non-square matrices.\n\nNow let's suppose we have the means to overcome the mathematical constrains. But we still have some practical challenges to overcome.\n\nConceptually, Equalization is to get the inverse (or pseudo inverse) of the channel matrix. It mean that the channel matrix should be given to Equalizer. How do I (meaning the reciever) know about the channel matrix ? If channel does not change at all, we may investigate about the channel before we build the communication system and preprogram the channel matrix directly into the reciever, but we cannot expect this kind of constant (never changing) channel condition in wireless communication. Channel property changes all the time in wireless environment. It means the reciever itself has to figure out the channel characteristics and build the channel matrix dynamically. This process (i.e, finding out channel characteristics) is called channel estimation. There are various kind of channel estimation techniques and some of those techniques are explained in this page.\n\nNOTE : Click on the image and it will lead you to the page with more examples and the Octave source code that I wrote for the examples.",

Even though the radio access and the core network signalling in principle supports up to 11 bearers, the UE capability was limited only to 8 data bearers. Since LTE Rel-8 operators have launched a number of new services, and it has become more and more evident that more than 8 radio bearers will be needed to support simultaneously all the services. Without this extension there can be risk of inconsistent end user service behaviour that will ultimately prevent adding further QoS based services for a UE. It also worth noting that LTE Rel-8 has a restriction of having 8 AM bearers or 5AM+3 UM data bearers, which limits further availability for emerging differentiated data services. As an example, there can be user cases and scenarios where up to 4 RLC AM might be needed.\n\nIn response to the aforementioned limitations, TSG RAN agreed to instantiate a new LTE Rel-15 WI aiming to remove those restrictions by increasing the number of supported data radio bearers.\n\nLTE Rel-8 functionality is limited to 8 data radio bearers, which was never revised in later releases. And even though radio access and the core network signalling supports in principle up to 11 data bearers, MAC header design has logical channel ID space only for 8 bearers.\n\nRAN WG2 decided to extend the MAC header logical channel ID space from 32 to 64 code points, which allows for not only extending the number of supported data radio bearers, but also introduces a possibility to add more MAC control elements in the future. After extensive discussions between RAN and SA WGs, it was concluded to extend the number of supported data radio bearers to 15 to minimize impact to the existing information elements on the NAS and CN signalling. It is also worth noting that extended number of LTE data radio bearers is also aligned with the 5G/NR technology, in which the minimum UE requirement is to support 16 data radio bearers.\n\nAs for RAN WG3, it has been concluded that radio access interfaces already can support up to 15 data radio bearers. In addition it, there also exist procedures to handle various error cases when e.g. one eNB does not support as many bearers as has been configured by the source eNB. As a summary, no changes were introduced in RAN WG3.\n\nFinally, it bears mentioning that even though this WI aimed at increasing the number of data radio bearers for LTE connected to EPC, same enhancements can be supported by a UE supporting LTE connected to 5GC, i.e. architecture options 5 and 7. In those deployment cases when both LTE and NR are connected to the same 5GC, it allows operator to deploy and use same services irrespective of the radio access technology that a UE is configured with.",

    "context": "https://www.sharetechnote.com/html/Communication_Convolution.html\n\nComm. Tech.: Convolution\n\nAs you know, a most typical approach to almost any of the engineering field is to draw out a mathematical model for each component of a system and combine all of the mathematical components to describe the whole system.\n\nLet's assume that we built a mathematical model for each compoenent of a communication system as shown below. As you see, we have a mathematical model named as X which is the model for the signal from a transmitter. and we have another mathematical model named as Y which is for Recieved signal. and we have the model H which is for the channel.\n\nAs I described above, we have the mathematical model for each component of the system. Now the question is how do we combine these componend model to make it for the whole system ?\n\nPartly by intuition and partly by our common sense, we would guess that 'combining X and Y in some format' should produce Y. Then the next question is 'How to combine X and Y' ?\n\nThe first guess would be to try with basic operators like +,-,x,/. Let's think about basic property of these operation. My personal image of these operators are as shown below. Can you make any sense out of this ? Probably no. What I am trying to say with this illustration is \"one lement of Y is created by only one element of X and only one element of H\". Basically they are one\nto one operation. It means that a specific elements in Y is only influenced by only one specific elements in H and Y.\n\nAccording to research and experiments, the received signal is not calculated by this kind of one-to-one operation as described above. In reality, one element in X is influenced by many other elements in X and Y. If I express this in an illustration, it would be as shown below.\n\nYou might not haven't seen this kind of operation in high school math, but this kind of operation is very common to various engineering field and this would give you a lot of hard time at entering the university level engineering because you have never been familiar with this kind of operation in high school math.\n\nThe most commonly used operator which is operating like this is 'Convolution'. The convolution can be described as shown below. The symbol '*' represents 'Convolution'. (Don't get confused with multiplication symbol that you use in your computer software).\n\nFor further detailed description of Convolution, refer to Convolution section of Engineering Math.\n\nConvolution is a mathematical operator which gives the result when a sequence of a data goes through a specific process. Basically each elements of an output sequence is influenced by many previous element of input sequence and all the elements within the process the signal is going through. At the beginning, this would be very confusing cocept and just any of single explanation and\nlecture would never give you complete understanding for it. I am pretty sure that my explanation here would not give you the complete understanding if this is the first time for you to hear about 'Convolution', but if you have gone through many other resources before, i am pretty sure that my explanation would give you some additional insight and clarification. I stronly recomment you to try googling 'Convolution' and it would give you a lot of explanation with a little bit different aspects. You would find\nsome Java applets or animation showing the concept of Counvolution. Even in YouTube, you would get a lot of lectures about Convolution. Try all those materials as much as possible.\n\nEven though you have understandings of Convolution in mathematical sense, you would not have your own intuitive understandings of the concept without a lot of practice. Unlike the simple mathemtical operators like +,-,x,/ it would be very difficult to do practice about Convolution just by pen and paper since the calulation process is so complicated.\n\nTo help you with the practice, I would give you a short Matlab/Octave script. Try changing the vector x and chann and see how the outcome changes. Try to make your own association (relation) between input(x), chann and output(y).\n\nI strongly, strongly recommend you to try this on your own with pen and paper until you grasp the meaning of the process. (I posted the excel spreadsheet for this process. You can get it from here and try wth different values for f(n), g(n))\n\nWhen you complete this whole process, collect the values shown in red cell on right side and place it in a raw from left to right. That is the final result of convolution.\n\nIf you think you got the complete understanding of the process shown above. Try followings by your hand and see if your answer is correct.\n\nx = [0 1 0 1 0 1]; % Change this array if you want to change input sequence (transmitted data)\n\nchan = [0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0]; % Change this array if you want to change the characteristics of channel\n\nsubplot(2,5,3);stem(chan,'MarkerFaceColor',[0 0 1]);axis([1 length(chan) -1.5 1.5]);title(\"chan\");\n\nsubplot(2,5,8);stem(chan,'MarkerFaceColor',[0 0 1]);axis([1 length(chan) -1.5 1.5]);title(\"chan\");\n\nNow let's look at the first example. The input (tx signal) is a typtical rectangular pulse that you see in various electrical engineering books. The channel has 10 elements in it and only the first item is nonzero value 1 and all the other elements are set as '0'. Here the channel is a process which is manipulating the input sequence.\n\nLook at the output. The output(rx signal) is the result of convolution of input(tx signal) and chan. You see there is no difference at all between the input and output. It means the channel in this example is just passing through the input sequence without any modification.\n\nNow let's look at another example. The input (tx signal) is a typtical rectangular pulse that you see in various electrical engineering books. The channel has 10 elements in it and only the first item is nonzero value 0.5 and all the other elements are set as '0'. Here the channel is a process which is manipulating the input sequence.\n\nLook at the output. The output(rx signal) is the result of convolution of input(tx signal) and chan. You see there is no difference in terms of overall shape but the amplitude of output is half (0.5 times) of the input signal.\n\nLet's look at another example. The input (tx signal) is a typtical rectangular pulse that you see in various electrical engineering books. The channel has 10 elements in it and only the fifth is nonzero value 1 and all the other elements are set as '0'. This channel is almost same as the first example. The only difference is that the position for the non-zero value appears.\n\nLook at the output. The output(rx signal) is the result of convolution of input(tx signal) and chan. You see there is almost no difference between the input and output and the only difference is that there is some delay between the input and output. It means the channel in this example is just delaying the input sequence without changing anything in terms of amplitude.\n\nLet's look at another example. The input (tx signal) is a typtical rectangular pulse that you see in various electrical engineering books. The channel has 10 elements in it and only the fifth is nonzero value 0.5 and all the other elements are set as '0'. This channel is almost same as the first example. The only difference is that the position for the non-zero value appears.\n\nLook at the output. The output(rx signal) is the result of convolution of input(tx signal) and chan. Now you see two differences between the input and output. You would notice that both delay and amplitude has been changed. It means the channel in this example is just delaying the input sequence and changing the amplitude as well.\n\nsubplot(2,5,3);stem(chan,'MarkerFaceColor',[0 0 1]);axis([1 length(chan) -1.5 1.5]);title(\"chan\");\n\nsubplot(2,5,8);stem(chan,'MarkerFaceColor',[0 0 1]);axis([1 length(chan) -1.5 1.5]);title(\"chan\");\n\nsubplot(2,5,3);stem(chan,'MarkerFaceColor',[0 0 1]);axis([1 length(chan) -1.5 1.5]);title(\"chan\");\n\nsubplot(2,5,8);stem(chan,'MarkerFaceColor',[0 0 1]);axis([1 length(chan) -1.5 1.5]);title(\"chan\");\n\nsubplot(2,5,3);stem(chan,'MarkerFaceColor',[0 0 1]);axis([1 length(chan) -1.5 1.5]);title(\"chan\");\n\nsubplot(2,5,8);stem(chan,'MarkerFaceColor',[0 0 1]);axis([1 length(chan) -1.5 1.5]);title(\"chan\");\n\nNote : I posted a visual note in slideshow and animation format to show the concept of this example to give you more intuitive understanding.

The group covered work on 2G and 3G radio capabilities, carrying on from 2G's roots in the original GSM pan-European digital mobile standard.\n\nWith 3G, the potential of a global market - for the equipment, handsets and for roaming - began to be achieved, as the standards community of Europe, China, Japan, Korea and North America united in 3GPP, from 1998. This highly successful project helped propel 2G evolution into 3G, and onwards towards fulfilling its promise to become the economic and technology success story of the 21st Century.\n\nTime marches on though, and although 2G and 3G are still in use today - it is time for the standards community to focus efforts on the new generations. As 4G evolves to 5G, we are safe in the knowledge that the GERAN and UTRAN standards, and the core network behind them are completely stable and can continue to be used for as long as there is a need.\n\nNote: update made July 9, to change title.

    "context": "https://www.3gpp.org/technologies/keywords-acronyms/105-son\n\nSON\n\nSON solutions can be divided into three categories: Self-Configuration, Self-Optimisation and Self-Healing. The SON architecture can be a centralized, distributed or a hybrid solution.\n\nThis is the dynamic plug-and-play configuration of newly deployed eNBs. The eNB will by itself configure the Physical Cell Identity, transmission frequency and power, leading to faster cell planning and rollout.\n\nThe interfaces S1 and X2 are dynamically configured, as well as the IP address and connection to IP backhaul. To reduce manual work ANR (Automatic neighbour relations) is used. ANR configures the neighbouring list in newly deployed eNBs and is optimizing the list configuration during operation.\n\nDynamic configuration includes the configuration of the Layer 1 identifier, Physical cell identity (PCI) and Cell global ID (CGID). There are 504 different PCIs available in LTE, the PCI mapping shall fulfill the collision free condition as well as the confusion free. The PCI can be assigned either in a centralized or distributed way.\n\nWhen centralised assignment is used the OAM system will have a complete knowledge and control of the PCIs. When the distributed solution is used the OAM system assigns a list of possible PCIs to the newly deployed eNB, but the adoption of the PCI is in control of the eNB. The newly deployed eNB will request a report, sent either by User Equipment (UEs) over the air interface or by other eNBs over the X2 interface, including already in-use PCIs, see figure 1. - The eNB will randomly select its PCI from the remaining values.\n\nANR is used to minimize the work required for configuration in newly deployed eNBs as well as to optimize configuration during operation. Correct and up-to-date neighbouring lists will increase the number of successful handovers and minimize the number of dropped calls. Before a handover can be executed the source eNB requires the neighbouring information: PCI and CGID of the target eNB.\n\nThe PCI is included in every normal measurement report. The mapping between the PCI and CGID parameters can be done by using information from the OAM or reported by UEs decoding the target cell CGID on the broadcast channel in the target cell, see figure 2. The capability of decoding CGID is an optional UE feature.\n\nA network operator can put a cell on a ANR black list, to block certain handover candidates, for example from indoor to outdoor cells. 3GPP has also specified LTE Inter-Frequency and Inter-RAT (Radio Access Technology) ANR.\n\nFunctions for self-optimisation are mainly included in Release 9. It includes optimisation of coverage, capacity, handover and interference.\n\nMobility load balancing (MLB) is a function where cells suffering congestion can transfer load to other cells, which have spare resources. MLB includes load reporting between eNBs to exchange information about load level and available capacity.\n\nThe periodicity of the reporting can be requested in the range of 1 to 10 s. The report can contain, hardware load, S1 transport network load and Radio resource status. The Radio resource status reports are separated in Up Link and Down Link reports, including the total allocation guaranteed and non-guaranteed bit rate traffic, the percentage of allocated Physical Resource Block (PRB) and the percentage of PRBs available for load balancing.\n\nMLB can also be used between different Radio Technologies. In case of inter-RAT the load reporting RAN Information Management (RIM) protocol will be used to transfer the information via the core between the base stations of different radio technologies. A cell capacity class value, set by the OAM-system, will be used to compare and weigh the different technologies radio capacities against each other.\n\nA handover due to load balancing is carried out as a regular handover, but it may be necessary to amend parameters so that the User Equipment (UE) does not return to the congested cell. The amendment must take place in both cells, so that the handover settings remain coherent in both. The eNBs need to estimate how much the cell border needs to be shifted, expressed in dB, to avoid a quick return of the UE.\n\nMobility robustness optimization (MRO) is a solution for automatic detection and correction of errors in the mobility configuration. In Release 9 the focus is on errors causing Radio link failure (RLF) due to too late or early handover, or handover to an incorrect cell.\n\nIn case of late handover, see figure 3, the handover procedure in the source cell is initialized too late, since the UE is moving faster than the Handover (HO) parameter settings allow. Hence when the RRC HO command from the serving cell is transmitted the signal strength is too weak to reach the UE, now located in the target cell, connection is lost. The UE attempts a connection re-establishment, containing PCID and C-RNTI belonging to the source cell, but received by the target cell. The target eNB will then inform the source cell about RLF to adjust Handover parameters.\n\nIt is a bit more complicated to detect a too early handover, see figure 4. The UE has successfully been handed over from source cell A to target cell B, but since it was triggered too early the connection will drop almost immediately due to too poor radio conditions in the target cell B. The UE will then try to re-establish the connection, which will now take place in the original source cell, cell A, since this cell is the strongest one. The UE will use the PCID and RNTI from the target cell B and the source cell A will then consider this as a Radio Link Failure due to too late handover and send an indication to the target cell B. But the target cell B will now recognize the parameters in the indication, as given to a mobile that had just completed a handover to cell B from cell A now indicating failure. The target cell B will send back a report about too early Handover to adjust Handover parameters, to the source cell A.\n\nIn order to save energy some cells can be switched off when capacity is not needed. The power consumption in a base station is not only related to load, a number of functions requires power even if there are no users to serve. But, if a cell is switched off, in the legal operator license there are still requirements on coverage, the coverage must be maintained at all times! The suspension of the cell may occur when the last user leaves the cell, all incoming handovers during this period of time will then be rejected. The cells that remain on, providing coverage, can wake up a suspended cell when traffic load increase. This can be done with a wake-up call to the sleeping cell.\n\nRACH optimisation aims to minimise the number of attempts on the RACH channel, causing interference. The UE can be polled by the eNB for RACH statistics after connection. The number of preambles sent until successful RACH completion, and the number of contention resolution failure are in the statistics. But PRACH configuration parameters can also be distributed amongst eNBs, like zero correlation configuration, root sequence, high speed flag and PRACH frequency offset.\n\nFeatures for automatic detection and removal of failures and automatic adjustment of parameters are mainly specified in Release 10.\n\nCoverage and Capacity Optimization enables automatic correction of capacity problems depending on slowly changing environment, like seasonal variations.\n\nMinimization of drive tests (MDT), is enabling normal UEs to provide the same type of information as those collected in drive test. A great advantage is that UEs can retrieve and report parameters from indoor environments.",

There may be zero, one, or several uplink DPDCHs on each radio link.\n\nThe uplink DPCCH is used to carry control information generated at Layer 1. The Layer 1 control information consists of known pilot bits to support channel estimation for coherent detection, transmit power-control (TPC) commands, feedback information (FBI), and an optional transport-format combination indicator (TFCI). The transport-format combination indicator informs the receiver about the instantaneous transport format combination of the transport channels mapped to the simultaneously transmitted uplink DPDCH radio frame. There is one and only one uplink DPCCH on each radio link. The uplink DPCCH may also carry DL FET ACK/NACK signalling information for DL FET operation when DL_DCH_FET_Config = 1.\n\nThe uplink DPCCH2 is used to carry control information generated at Layer 1. The Layer 1 control information consists of known pilot bits to support channel estimation for coherent detection, and transmit power-control (TPC) commands. When DPCCH2 is configured there is one and only one uplink DPCCH2 for all radio links. When DPCCH2 is configured, the UE shall transmit DPCCH2 only in the slots in which DPCCH is transmitted.\n\nThe uplink S-DPCCH is used to carry control information generated at Layer 1. The Layer 1 control information consists of known pilot bits to support channel sounding and channel estimation for coherent detection. There is up to one uplink S-DPCCH on each radio link in the case that UL_CLTD_Enabled as defined in [5] is TRUE. Figure 1 shows the frame structure of the uplink DPDCH, the uplink DPCCH, the uplink DPCCH2 and the uplink S-DPCCH. Each radio frame of length 10 ms is split into 5 subframes, each of 3 slots, each of length Tslot = 2560 chips, corresponding to one power-control period. The DPDCH, DPCCH, S-DPCCH and DPCCH2 are always frame aligned with each other.\n\nThe parameter k in figure 1 determines the number of bits per uplink DPDCH slot. It is related to the spreading factor SF of the DPDCH as SF = 256/2k. The DPDCH spreading factor may range from 256 down to 4. The spreading factor of the uplink DPCCH, the uplink DPCCH2 and the uplink S-DPCCH is always equal to 256, i.e. there are 10 bits per uplink DPCCH/S-DPCCH/DPCCH2 slot.\n\nThe exact number of bits of the uplink DPDCH and the different uplink DPCCH fields (Npilot, NTFCI, NFBI, and NTPC) is given by table 1 and table 2. What slot format to use is configured by higher layers and can also be reconfigured by higher layers. The exact number of bits of the uplink S-DPCCH is given by table 2A.\n\nThe uplink DPCCH2 reuses slot format #1 of DPCCH, and the exact number of bits is given in table 2.\n\nThe channel bit and symbol rates given in table 1, table 2 and table 2A are the rates immediately before spreading. The pilot patterns are given in table 3 and table 4, the TPC bit pattern is given in table 5.\n\nThe FBI bits are used to support techniques requiring feedback from the UE to the UTRAN Access Point for operation of closed loop mode transmit diversity. The use of the FBI bits is described in detail in [5].\n\nThere are two types of uplink dedicated physical channels; those that include TFCI (e.g. for several simultaneous services) and those that do not include TFCI (e.g. for fixed-rate services). These types are reflected by the duplicated rows of table 2. It is the UTRAN that determines if a TFCI should be transmitted and it is mandatory for all UEs to support the use of TFCI in the uplink. The mapping of TFCI bits onto slots is described in [3].\n\nDPCCH slot format 5 is used when DL_DCH_FET_Config is configured by higher layers. In this case, over a 20ms Compression Interval (CI) consisting of 30 slots, the bits in the TFCI field carry TFCI information in the first 10 slots, and may carry an ACK/NACK indicator for DL FET in the remaining 20 slots. The ACK/NACK for DL FET is sent when DL_DCH_FET_Config = 1.\n\nIn compressed mode, DPCCH slot formats with TFCI fields are changed. There are two possible compressed slot formats for normal slot formats 0 and 2. They are labelled A and B and the selection between them is dependent on the number of slots that are transmitted in each frame in compressed mode. When DL_DCH_FET_Config is configured by higher layers, UL DPCCH slot format 5 is used in compressed mode. In compressed mode when UL_DCH_FET_Config is configured by higher layers, TFCI bits represent TFCI information in the first 10 slots that are not in compressed-mode gaps in a 20ms CI. The TFCI bits in subsequent slots that are not in the compressed mode gaps represent ACK/NACK indication for DL FET when DL_DCH_FET_Config = 1.\n\nIf UL_DTX_Active is TRUE (see [5]), the number of transmitted slots per radio frame may be less than the number shown in Table 2 and Table 2A.\n\nThe pilot bit pattern for S-DPCCH is the same as that for uplink DPCCH with Npilot = 8. The Nfixed bits in the S-DPCCH are fixed to \"10\".\n\nThe pilot bit pattern for DPCCH2 is the same as that for uplink DPCCH with Npilot = 8.\n\nThe pilot bit patterns are described in table 3 and table 4. The shadowed column part of pilot bit pattern is defined as FSW and FSWs can be used to confirm frame synchronization. (The value of the pilot bit pattern other than FSWs shall be \"1\".)\n\nThe relationship between the TPC bit pattern and transmitter power control command is presented in table 5.\n\nMulti-code operation is possible for the uplink dedicated physical channels. When multi-code transmission is used, several parallel DPDCH are transmitted using different channelization codes, see [4]. However, there is only one DPCCH per radio link, one DPCCH2 if DPCCH2 is configured and up to one S-DPCCH in the case that UL_CLTD_Enable is TRUE.\n\nA period of uplink DPCCH transmission prior to the start of the uplink DPDCH transmission (uplink DPCCH power control preamble) shall be used for initialisation of a DCH. The length of the power control preamble is a higher layer parameter, Npcp , signalled by the network [5]. The UL DPCCH shall take the same slot format in the power control preamble as afterwards, as given in table 2. When Npcp > 0 the pilot patterns of table 3 and table 4 shall be used. The timing of the power control preamble is described in [5], subclause 4.3.2.3. The TFCI field is filled with \"0\" bits.",

The split of control plane and user plane via E1 interface enhances the split between gNB-CU (gNB central unit) and gNB-DU (gNB distributed unit) defined within the NR WI. It offers the possibility of:\n\n(1) optimizing the location of different RAN functions based on the deployment scenario, (2) support efficient radio resource isolation for network slicing, (3) independent scaling of CP and UP capacity.\n\nIn the NR WI, a split of the gNB into a gNB-CU and a gNB-DU is defined. The gNB-CU hosts the RRC, SDAP and PDCP radio protocols, while the gNB-DU hosts the PHY, MAC and RLC radio protocols. The gNB-CU and the gNB-DU are connected via the F1 interface. This WI complements the split defined in the NR WI by enabling to split the gNB-CU into a gNB-CU-CP and a gNB-CU-UP. The gNB-CU-CP hosts the RRC and the instance of the PDCP protocol serving the control plane, while the gNB-CU-UP hosts the SDAP and the instance of the PDCP protocol serving the user plane. The gNB-CU-CP and the gNB-CU-UP are connected via the E1 interface. The gNB-CU-CP is connected to the gNB-DU via the control plane part of the F1 interface (F1-C), while the gNB-CU-UP is connected to the gNB-DU via the user plane part of the F1 interface (F1-U). The resulting gNB architecture inclusive of both the CU-DU split and the CP-UP split, is illustrated in Figure 12.1-1.\n\nThe architecture shown in Figure 1 enables the following deployment scenarios [2]:\n\nThe call-flows showing the most relevant procedures involving the E1 interface (e.g., initial UE attach, handover, bearer context setup and release) are captured in TS 38.401 [3].

The split of control plane and user plane via E1 interface enhances the split between gNB-CU (gNB central unit) and gNB-DU (gNB distributed unit) defined within the NR WI. It offers the possibility of:\n\n(1) optimizing the location of different RAN functions based on the deployment scenario, (2) support efficient radio resource isolation for network slicing, (3) independent scaling of CP and UP capacity.\n\nIn the NR WI, a split of the gNB into a gNB-CU and a gNB-DU is defined. The gNB-CU hosts the RRC, SDAP and PDCP radio protocols, while the gNB-DU hosts the PHY, MAC and RLC radio protocols. The gNB-CU and the gNB-DU are connected via the F1 interface. This WI complements the split defined in the NR WI by enabling to split the gNB-CU into a gNB-CU-CP and a gNB-CU-UP. The gNB-CU-CP hosts the RRC and the instance of the PDCP protocol serving the control plane, while the gNB-CU-UP hosts the SDAP and the instance of the PDCP protocol serving the user plane. The gNB-CU-CP and the gNB-CU-UP are connected via the E1 interface. The gNB-CU-CP is connected to the gNB-DU via the control plane part of the F1 interface (F1-C), while the gNB-CU-UP is connected to the gNB-DU via the user plane part of the F1 interface (F1-U). The resulting gNB architecture inclusive of both the CU-DU split and the CP-UP split, is illustrated in Figure 12.1-1.\n\nThe architecture shown in Figure 1 enables the following deployment scenarios [2]:\n\nThe call-flows showing the most relevant procedures involving the E1 interface (e.g., initial UE attach, handover, bearer context setup and release) are captured in TS 38.401 [3]. The E1 functions and procedures are described in TS 38.460 [4]. The E1 physical layer and the signalling transport, which is based on the SCTP/IP protocol stack, are described respectively in TS 38.461 [5] and TS 38.462 [6]. The E1 application protocol (E1AP) is specified in TS 38.463 [7] and includes the description of: (1) the E1 interface management procedures, which allow to setup the E1 interface and to exchange the relevant configuration data between a gNB-CU-CP and a gNB-CU-UP; (2) the bearer context management procedures, which allow to setup and configure user plane resources to serve UEs.\n\nReferences\n\n12.1.2\tManagement Enhancement for EPC Control and User Plane Separation (CUPS)\n\nSummary based on the input provided by Huawei in SP-190029.\n\nThis work item specified management enhancements to support EPC CUPS, including performance measurements related to split S/P-GW architecture in TS 32.426, EPC Network Resource Model (NRM) Integration Reference Point (IRP) Information Service (IS) and Solution Set (SS) modifications in TS 28.708 and TS 28.709.\n\nThis work item implemented the conclusion of the study on Management Enhancement of CUPS of EPC Nodes (FS_MECUPS).

    "context": "https://www.sharetechnote.com/html/IoT/App_Protocol_MQTT.html\n\nIoT: MQTT\n\nMQTT stands for Message Queuing Telemetry Transport. or MQ Telemetry Transport. It is extremly simple and lightweight messaging protocol based on publish / subscribe mechanism.\n\nIn case of current high bandwidth connection (like ordinary internet, WiFi, Cellular), we already have so wide varieties of protocols like http, ftp, sip etc. Most of these protocols is generating relatively large traffic even though it can be considered as almost nothing with recent broadband communication technology and it would not be a big issue even with IoT devices if the devices is based on celluar network (e.g, WCDMA or LTE). However, this kind of protocol can cause untolerable amount of traffic for the devices that is based on very low throughput and small sized packet system like 6LoWPAN. For this kind of low throughput/small packet based system, we would need very light , simple and small sized application layer protocol. MQTT is one of the most popular protocol that meets this requirement.\n\nFor learning any kind of protocol, my personal approach is almost always same. To understand the packet (or frame) structure and then following through a couple of example protol sequences line by line. Sometimes I practice decoding the captured hex stream by hand based on Packet Structure specification. I will do the same thing here.\n\nProtocol Sequence of MQTT is very simple as illustrated below. First, Client (IoT End Device) request connection to a Broker (a kind of server). If the connection accepted, the device (client) would send 'SUBSRIBE' message saying \"I want to get this and this kind of data. So please send me the data whenever those data is upadated on your side (Broker)\". If this request is accepted by Broker, the broker would send the data to the device whenever any new data comes into the database. For more details on profocol sequence, see 'Protocol Sequence' section. For more details on the structure and contents of each message, refer to Packet structure section.\n\nEven though the description and examples came from myself, the packet structure shown here is based on MQTT V3.1 Protocol Specification by International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) Eurotech. Format representation is modified a little bit for easier understanding for myself.\n\nFollowing is one example protocol sequence that I captured from my trial with HiveMQ Websocket Client. You may get a little bit different variations if you try on your own, but overall procedure and message structure would be similar to the example shown here. Give it a try on your own and you will get used to it very quickly. MQTT is one of the simplest protocol you can see in wireless communication area and I think this would be the biggest reason why MQTT is adopted as one of the dominant protocols in IoT.\n\nYes, Try with HiveMQ Websocket Client. This is what I used to capture the most of sample log for this page.",

The 10 ms message part radio frame is split into 15 slots, each of length Tslot = 2560 chips. Each slot consists of two parts, a data part to which the RACH transport channel is mapped and a control part that carries Layer 1 control information. The data and control parts are transmitted in parallel. A 10 ms message part consists of one message part radio frame, while a 20 ms message part consists of two consecutive 10 ms message part radio frames. The message part length is equal to the Transmission Time Interval of the RACH Transport channel in use. This TTI length is configured by higher layers.\n\nThe data part consists of 10*2k bits, where k=0,1,2,3. This corresponds to a spreading factor of 256, 128, 64, and 32 respectively for the message data part.\n\nThe control part consists of 8 known pilot bits to support channel estimation for coherent detection and 2 TFCI bits. This corresponds to a spreading factor of 256 for the message control part. The pilot bit pattern is described in table 8. The total number of TFCI bits in the random-access message is 15*2 = 30.

The process of directed retry involves the assignment of a UE/MS to a radio channel on a cell other than the serving cell. This process is triggered by the assignment procedures, as described in 3GPP TS 48.008, and employs internal or external GSM to UMTS handover procedures as described in subclauses 6.2.2 and 8.2. The successful procedure for a directed retry in case of an intra-3G_MSC GSM to UMTS handover is as shown in figure 40a and as described below.\nIf during the assignment phase, as represented by the A-ASSIGNMENT-REQUEST message, a GSM to UMTS handover becomes necessary, due to radio conditions, congestion or inability to provide the requested bearer service in GSM, then the UE/MS may be handed over to a UMTS cell. If the requested bearer service cannot be provided in GSM, 3G_MSC-A shall indicate in the A-ASSIGNMENT-REQUEST message that handover to UMTS should be performed. When the decision has been made to handover the UE/MS the BSS-A may send an A-ASSIGNMENT-FAILURE message, indicating 'directed retry', before sending the A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message to 3G_MSCA, indicating 'directed retry'. However BSS-A may alternatively send the A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message, indicating 'directed retry', without sending the A-ASSIGNMENT-FAILURE message. Other cause values may be used instead of \"Directed Retry\" in the A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message, this will allow the 3G_MSC to take different actions dependent on the received cause. Upon receipt of the A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message from BSS-A, then 3G_MSCA shall initiate the GSM to UMTS handover as described in subclauses 6.2.2 and 8.2. No resources shall be cleared in the 3G_MSCA or BSS-A for this connection.\n\nAfter receipt of the Iu-RELOCATION-COMPLETE message from RNS-B the assignment procedure shall be considered to be complete and the resources on BSS-A shall be cleared.\nIf a failure occurs during the handover attempt, for example A-HANDOVER-FAILURE returned from BSS-A or Iu-RELOCATION FAILURE from RNS-B then 3G_MSCA will terminate the GSM to UMTS handover to RNS-B. Under these conditions 3G_MSCA may optionally take one of a number of actions:\nThe procedures for Inter-3G_MSC GSM to UMTS handover are also applicable to the directed retry process.

Does it mean 'emergency' ? or 'electronic' ? or something else ?\n\nEven though I haven't seen any formal documents that explicitely defines the letter 'e' in eCall, I think it would not be wrong if you say the 'e' mean 'emergency', i.e, 'eCall' would mean 'emergency Call'. But this interpretation would confuse a lot of people. Then, how does eCall differ from what we normally call 'Emergency Call (like 911)' ?\n\nI will explain on the details of this difference later, but simply put, the biggest difference would be the usual 'Emergency call' is a kind of voice call between a human and Emergency Call Center (usually another person in Emergency Call Center)' but 'eCall' is a call between a machine (called IVS : In Vehicle System within an automobile) and Emergency Center;.\n\nFor the persons who likes formal definition, I would quote some descriptions from a couple of international standards as follows :\n\neCall is a manually or automatically initiated emergency call, (TS12 : teleServiceCode 12) from a vehicle, supplemented with a minimum set of emergency related data (MSD), as defined under the EU Commission's eSafety initiative\n\neCall provides reliable full-duplex data communications between IVS and PSAP in addition to emergency voice call (E112) via the cellular network, and can be initiated either automatically or manually. The eCall In-band Modem uses the same voice channel as used for the emergency voice call. eCall allows reliable transmission of MSD alternating with a speech conversation through the existing voice communication paths in cellular mobile phone systems. The expected benefit is that emergency services will be made aware of accidents much more rapidly, will get precise information on location, vehicle type etc. and therefore will be able to reach accident victims faster, with the potential to save many lives annually.\n\nBefore we talk of the technical details of eCall, let's take a 10000-feet overview (high level view) on how eCall go through. You may find a lot of illustrations, cartoons on eCall from internet and following is my own version of illustration. I put the number labels on each of the steps and I would put a short descriptions on what's happening at each step.\n\n(2) eCall is triggered. eCall can be triggered in many ways. It can be triggered automatically by Air Bag or internal sensors. Or a person (e.g, driver) in the car can push the emergency button in the car to trigger the eCall.\n\n(3) The eCall device installed in the car (called IVS : In-Vehicle System) go through Emergency Voice Call setup process to establish the voice call channel. Once the voice call channel is established, the IVS send eCall Data (MSD : Minimal Set of Data) to PSAP (Public Safety Answering Point)\n\n(4) Once the eCall Data(MSD) is received by PSAP, the information would show up automatically on the screen at PSAP center.\n\n(5) The personnel at PSAP center may try voice contact to the person in the car if possible. But there would be many cases where this is not possible when person in the car is injured badly.\n\nFor those who came from Cellular protocol and new to eCall, it would be a little confusing on figuring out the difference between eCall and another type of Emergency Call (like 911 in North America) which we are familiar with in daily life. For those people, I think it would be easier / clearer to explain the difference in terms of overall protocol sequence. Following is my understanding (the image formed in my brain when I first got trained about this).\n\nAs you see here in the following illustration, there is common portions and different portions between eCall and Emergency Call.\n\nNOTE : IVS stands for In-Vehicle System. It is the eCall / Cellular module that are installed within Car (within Telematics module in most case). In terms of testing, this is a DUT\n\neCall Higher Layer Application Protocol (HLAP) is very simple (at least comparting to Cellular Protocol). Actually there is only one critical data to be transferred. The critical data is called MSD(Minimal Set of Data). All the remaining part is just to get MSD delivered to PSAP (Emergency Call Center) with reliability.\n\nAs in Cellular Voice Call, in HLAP there are two different type of call mode depending on who (IVS or PSAP) initiates call. The eCall initiated by IVS is called 'PUSH mode' and this is similar concept as MO(Mobile Originating) call in cellular voice call.\n\nThe eCall initiated by PSAP is called 'PULL mode' and this is similar concept as MT(Mobile Terminating) call in cellular voice call.\n\nThe two illustrations in this section is based on ETSI 103.428 Figure 2. The ETSI diagram is a single diagram showing both PUSH and PULL mode in single sequence. It looked a little confusing to me, so I split the digram into two separate diagram as shown below.\n\nNOTE 1 : IVS stands for In-Vehicle System. It is the eCall / Cellular module that are installed within Car (within Telematics module in most case). In terms of testing, this is a DUT\n\nNOTE 2 : PSAP stands for Public Safety Answering Point. This is a kind of Emergency Call Center.\n\nPSAP PUSH Mode Call is like MO call in celluar terminology. This is the call initiated by IVS (the mobile unit installed inside the car). I think in most case of eCall, the eCall goes in PUSH mode as illustrated below.\n\nPSAP PUSH Mode Call is like MT call in celluar terminology. This is the call initiated by PSAP (the call center). If you compare this with PUSH mode sequence, you would notice that most of the part are same. The only difference is the SEND-MSD (START) signal before the Initiation signal. This is also very much like cellular protocol. If you compare the MO Call and MT Call sequence in cellular protocol, you would notice that most part of the two are almost same. The main difference is that in MT Call the cellular network send 'Paging' (a kind of trigger for UE to initiate the call).\n\nAnother sequence that illustrate the eCall process with a little low layer point of view (especially in terms of LL/HL ACK operation) is shown below. This applies to both PUSH and PULL model.\n\n< ETSI TR 126.969 - Figure 1: Timeline of eCall with IVS initiated signalling and HL-ACK in normal operation >\n\nThere are various timers in eCall protocol which should be met in order to guarantee the normal functionality of the eCall. Some of these timers are an important criterial of testing eCall functionality.\n\nAs mentioned above, the only one fundamental goal for eCall is to deliver MSD(Minimal Set of Data) with reliability. Then you may ask what kind of information is in the MSD. High level description of the imformation in MSD can be find from following description. As you see, the most important information in the MSD is the location data and vehicle information.\n\nThe eCall modem allows to transfer a data message from the IVS over the cellular network to the PSAP which is denoted as eCall MSD. The MSD can include, e.g. vehicle location information, time stamp, number of passengers, Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), and other relevant accident information\n\nThe Minimum Set of Data forming the data component of an eCall sent from a vehicle to a Public Safety Answering Point or other designated emergency call centre. The MSD has a maximum size of 140 bytes and includes, for example, vehicle identity, location information and time-stamp.\n\nBefore we think of this, let's think of why we need to care of this. We should care of this because eCall signaling message and data are delivered in the form of Voice call data of GSM or WCDMA cellular network.\n\nIn GSM / WCDMA, various different types of codecs are used. Basically the codec selection is a job for the specific Radio Access Network equipment(RAN Equipment) that is communicating with the eCall device. The RAN Equipment (Network) would select the codec that would give the best performance in a specific situation. 'Performance' mean 'How fast the eCall data can be delivered' and 'How reliably it can be delivered under a specific channel condition'. It would be too much (or too boring) to present the full details on these performance here. If you are really interested in the details, refer to ETSI TR 126.969 and it would give you a lot of test data for various different Codecs.\n\nIn theory, you can use a live network and PSAP Simulator to test your eCall Device (IVS). But theory is just a theory. You would come across a lot of issues to overcome if you go for this option even though I cannot say it is impossible.\n\nAnother way of testing the eCall device is to construct test setup as described in ETSI 103.428 section 6 Test Configurations. In this document, it is described to use a private cellular network for various Interoperability and Conformance Testing.\n\nThe most practical solution (Test setup) that will be used in the industry would be to use Cellular Network Simulator and PSAP simulator as illustrated below.\n\nAssuming that you have a test setup and you need to determine what to test. As in most of other wireless and cellular device device, you may think of general test that tend to happen during the development or system integration stage. We often call these test in various different name such as function test, integration test or smoke test etc. Usually test specification / procedure tend not to be clearly defined or the procedure changes often depending on situations. Also those test procedure / test item may vary depending on manufacturer. Therefore, it would not be easy to clearly define on what to test for this stage. However, if you just take a close look at the overall eCall protocol, you would easily guess high level test items even without looking into any specification. My personal version of the guess work about the first level test are shown below. You may come up with different idea, but I don't think there would be any big difference between your idea and my idea.\n\nOnce you complete the general function test during development and system integration level and have a stable device, you would forward the device to conformance test. Once you are at the stage of conformance test, you don't have to worry about what to test because a lot of other people (standard body) put a lot of effort and energy and came out with well defined document. In 3GPP/ETSI, those test procedures are defined in ETSI TS 103.428.\n\nAfter completing the conformance, if you are trying to sell the device (acutually Automakers trying to sell cars) in a specific region (e.g, Europe, Asia, America etc), you may need to go through a specific set of test cases specified by the regulatory body in that specific region.\n\nFollowings are the examples of how eCall is being testing during the development or for conformance test before commercialization.\n\nFollowings are the list of the specifications for eCall. I think the most fundamental specifications are CEN documents. But it is not free to get those spec. Recently 3GPP / ETSI has released various specifications. I think most part of the 3GPP specification are based on CEN specification.\n\n: Describes mostly on physical/transport layer design and process of transmitter and reciever.\n\n: This documents describes on API and parameter descriptions of eCall modem protocol stack. It describes on overall software architecture and API prototype but not show the function body. Unless you are developing the protocol stack, you would not need to read this spec.\n\n: This documents describes general logics on eCall Test, but it does not specifies any specific test cases or details of protocol sequence. If you are interested in physical / transport layer level testing, this document would help you to catch the overall test concept.\n\n: If you are interested in high level protocol and function test, this document would help a lot. It shows overall protocol sequence of eCall and decfines specific test sequences. Most of the test in this document (as of V1.1.1 (2016-06)) are based on CEN EN 16062:2015\n\nRoad transport and traffic telematics eSafety eCall minimum set of data - Draft EN 081018\n\nIntelligent transport systems eSafety - Pan European eCall - Operating requirements",

    "context": "https://www.sharetechnote.com/html/Handbook_LTE_LTEU_LTER.html\n\nLTE Adv: LAA/LTE-U\n\nRecently (from 2014 as far as I remember), there has been pretty much discussion (even real testing going on) on LTE being extended to non-standard mode of operation (Non 3GPP yet at least up to this point, as of Jan 2015).\n\nNote : In early second half of 2016, I saw a company to try LTE-U device for the first timie, and as it approaches to the end of the year, I saw many companies testing LTE-U devices. Now in early 2017 we are at the stage of testing LAA.\n\nTwo of the technology falling into this category is LTE-U and LTE-R. LTE-U has been proposed and start being implemented in the industry for about a year and LTE-R just start being proposed as Integrated wireless railway network to be commercialized .\n\nAs of Jun 2016, I don't see/hear anything about LTE-R.. but I saw the drastic evolution of unlicensed LTE that created several different technologies (names) to the list. It started with LTE-U and evolved to LAA, eLAA and recently we are hearing of new branches like MulteFire and LWA. I don't know how many other technologies are waiting to be newly evolved and which of these technologies\nwill survive to the end.. some of them are now pretty well defined but there are a lot of other features to be defined technically. I will keep following them up and try to write down whatever has been clarified.\n\nFollowings are the brief descriptions for each of these technologies. I will put further details under separate section if more technical details are published. Also, I put many whitepapers and YouTube links under Reference section. I would recommend you to go through those materials when you have free time and use this page as reminder afterwards. (The contents of this table\nis mostly based on Ref [7] )\n\nFollowings are the list of topics that gives you further details of various LTE-Unlicensed technologies.\n\nIn every wireless communication, the communicating parties (transmitter and reciever) need to allocatie a certain amount of resources in both time domain and frequency domain. However, we don't have much control over frequency domain resource allocation because those resources are fixed permanently or semi-statically. So it is usually not in the scope of scheduling. When it comes to scheduling, Time Domain resource allocation tend to be more important.\n\nIn 3GPP based technology (i.e, Cellular Communication Technology like LTE), the time domain scheduling is obvious and determinstic even when there are many devices are in communication because all of the time domain resources determined by the central master (Base Station /Node B/eNode B). However, in 802.11 based technology(i.e LAN, Wireless LAN etc) there is no central controling master in terms of scheduling. In this case, there is always possibility that transmission signal from one device interfere with communication of other devices. To prevent (or at least reduce) this situation, we need a special algorithm for Time Domain Scheduling. Time Domain Scheduling in this case mean 'Determine when to transmit and how long it transmit'.\n\nThen why we need to care of this kind of thing in LTE-Unlicensed technology ? Basically LTE Unlicensed technology (e.g, LTE-U, LAA etc) refer to a technology in which LTE operates in 802.11 frequency region. So LTE need to keep the rule set by 802.11 in order not to prevent the communiction between existing 802.11 devices.\n\nThere are many variations of the time domain scheduling, but the basic idea and logic is same. Basic idea is 'Your transmission should not interfere with communication between others' and the basic logic is 'Before you transmit anything, check if the chennel(medium) is already being used by others'. This logic can be illustrated as follows.\n\nThen you may have some questions as follows : How to check (i.e, how to figure out) whether the channel (medium) is being used by other ? and how long the device need to check before it make any decision ?\n\nIn the effort to answer these questions, you will come across many terms that may confuse you for so long. I tried to list up those confusing words and how these are related to each other in following illustration. If you are new to this area, I would suggest you to understand 'what is CS and ED ?' first and then try to understand how CS / ED is used in higher level technology like CSMA/CD, CSMA/CA, CCS, LBT, CSAT etc. Already feel headache ? :)\n\nCS / ED : CS stands for Carrier Sensing and ED stands for Energy Detection. The fundamental concept is same. The term CS is more frequently used in 802.11 area especially for Wired LAN Area. In this technology, the device measures the energy level in the channel (medium) mostly in the form of voltage and compares the measured voltage with a specified value (threshold value). ED stands for Energy Detection. it is more frequently used in wireless/cellular technology. In this method, the device measures the energy level in the channel (medium) mostly in the form of Power and compares the measured power with a specified value (threshold value)\n\nCSMA/CD or CSMA/CA : As the term CSMA(Carrier Sensing Multiple Access) implies, these are technology of figuring out whether a channel is available or not based on CS method. You don't need to know the details of thechnology under the context of LTE-Unlicensed technology, but if you are really interested in thses method refer to CSMA/CD and CSMA/CA page.\n\nCCA : CCA stands for Clear Channel Assessment. As the word implies, this is a method to figure out the channel is clear (i.e, nobody is using the channel). CCA perform ED(Energy Detection) for a certain period of time and make a decision whether the channel is clear or not. It is a common method being used in 802.11 (WLAN) technology.\n\nHow long CCA perform ED before it make decision ? It depends on higher layer technology (e.g, 802.11 FHSS, 802.11 OFDM, LBT). However, the minimum time span is 18 us sec.\n\nWhat is the threshold energy level to make decision whether the channel is being used by some other device or not ? This also varies depending on power class of the device and reciever antenna gain. However, the base threshold is -70 dBm.\n\nNOTE : Refer to 802.11 specification and ETSI EN 300 328 if you want to get full details and requirement for CCA.\n\nLBT: LBT stands for Listen Before Talk. According to ETSI EN 300 328, LBT is defined as 'mechanism by which an equipment applies clear channel assessment (CCA) before using the channel' (In this document, you can find a couple of variations of LBT depending on different situations). As you see in the terminology itself, 'Listen Before Talk' indicate two major process, the first one is 'Listen' and the second part is 'Talk'. The meaning of 'Talk' is obvious. It means 'Transmit Data'. The tricky part is 'what does it exactly mean by 'Listen''. In more technical definition, 'Listen' mean 'perform CCA(Clear Channel Assessment)'. You can find a more detailed description on LBT in IEEE P802.19-08/0034r0 (The specific value (i.e, transmission time, threshold value may vary depending on application, but I think this explains overal LBT mechanism in easier way than other documents).\n\nCSAT : CSAT stands for Carrier Sensing Adaptive Transmission. CSAT is very similar to CSMA or LBT(Listen Before Talk), the main difference is that CSAT monitors(senses) the medium for much longer duration (around tens of msec to 200 msec) comparing to normal WiFi CSMA, so that it would not interfere not only with WiFi\ndata transmission (QoS traffic) but also with more sporadic transmission like discovery signals (Ref [2]). Unlike other techiques described in this section (defined with focus on 802.11 technology), CSAT is defined by LTE-U Forum with focus on 3GPP technology.\n\nIn LTE, every transmission within a specified spectrum is well managed/scheduled both for downlink and uplink. So Network can figure out exactly when to transmit something and when UE will transmit something.. but in Unlicensed band transmission and reception by the existing WiFi device is not as predictable as in LTE. Basically anybody can transmit in anytime as long as it complies with\nCSMA/CA procedure.\n\nIn this kind of situation, how LTE network can schedule transmission in Unlicensed band ?\n\nOne method is for LTE cell to perform a special channel selection procedure and allocate the channel only when it is clean. \nIn channel selection process, network measures the energy level within the allowed band and use those area in which the energy level is under a certain threshold (e.g, -62 dBm over 20 Mhz BW).\n\nThe Cell performs this kind of channel selection algorithm in on-going mode and if needed it will select more suitable channel and switch to it.\n\nWhat if you (a Cell) fail to find any clean channel at the initial channel selection process ?\n\nIn this case, the cell use another mechanism called CSAT (Carrier-Sensing Adaptive Transmission). Technically, CSAT is very similar to CSMA or LBT(Listen Before Talk), the main difference is that CSAT monitors(senses) the medium for much longer duration (around tens of msec to 200 msec) comparing to normal WiFi CSMA, so that it would not interfere not only with WiFi\ndata transmission (QoS traffic) but also with more sporadic transmission like discovery signals (Ref [2]).\n\nAccording to Reference [5], there seems to be roughly three levels of Coexistence strategy regarding LTE-U. Most of these techniques are already mentioned in previous section, but let me rewrite in a little bit different words.\n\nChannel Selection : This says \"Use WiFi band only when it is not being used (i.e, the band is clean)\". To figure out whether it is being used or not, you have to measure the engergy level of the target band as described above.\n\nTime-domain coexistence techniques : Even when it fail to find any clean channel in channel selection stage, there is still some chance. Even though there is no clean channel at the point of channel selection, there might be some empty slots if you look at the time domain scheduling with relatively high granularity.\nTo find out this kind of time domain opportunity and in order not to make an interference at any time, they are considering several different technology like CSAT, eCSAT, LBT. My personal question were 'do we have to support all these technology everywhere (every devices)?'. This question was answered by Reference [5] as follows.\n\nFor non listen-before-talk (LBT) markets such as the US, South Korea, China and India, CSAT (Carrier Sensing Adaptive Transmission) can be used without changing Rel-10 Carrier Aggregation protocols for co-channel coexistence. For LBT markets such as Europe and Japan, Rel-13 LAA will enable channel sharing with Wi-Fi by performing clear channel assessment (CCA) based channel availability sensing and adapting the transmission duration on a fine timescale, ranging from 1ms-10ms\n\nOpportunistic SCell operation : To me, this sounds like a rule (not a technology). Basically this says \"Use the unlicensed band only when it is really necessary (e.g, in real demand on high throughput or when the primary cell is overloaded). Release the unlicensenced and fall back to anchor carrier when\nthe demand for unlicenced band is not critical.\n\nInterplay of these coexistance technical components are well illustrated as follows in Ref [2].\n\nLTE-U stands for LTE-Unlicensed. This is the first real implementation of the whole LTE-Unlicensed family as far as I remember. Since this is already implemented and tested relatively widely and a lot of details are known, I thought I got enough information to write this subject in a separate page. Refer to LTE-U page for the details.\n\nIn other LTE-Unlincensed technology, LTE borrow only radio spectrum from WLAN and all the transmission/reception technology except radio spectrum purely based on LTE. However, in LWA LTE borrows not only WLAN radio spectrum but also WLAN Access Point for transmitting data. This key difference is illustrated as below. To implement this key difference, we would need to implement many other\ntechnical components. The most important part would be to implmenet special interface between LTE eNB and WLAN AP. Then you may ask.. at which layer the eNB and WLAN will be connected ? It would be quicker to interact if they can get connected at lower layer (e.g, PHY/MAC), but LTE PHY/MAC and WLAN PHY/MAC is completely different.. so hard to make any connection at this layer. So they will use higher layer (specifically PDCP) for this connection. As you know, there is no PDCP layer in WLAN. So connecting at PDCP\nlayer might be a little bit misleading. More accruately speaking, LTE PDCP packet will be encapsulated into WLAN MAC frame.\n\nNow LWA is defined in 3GPP specification and I created a separate page for 3GPP LWA because it will be a long story. Refer to LWA page for the 3GPP details.\n\nAround the end of 2016, I start hearing of implementing this both on UE modem and Network, UE testing equipment side. Now (as of early 2017) I am hearing of testing this feature on real UE. So I decided to create separate page for this. Read LAA page for the details.\n\nPutting very simple way, Multipath Aggregation (more formally Multipath TCP Aggregation : mptcp) is LTE-WLAN aggregation at TCP level as illustrated below. The key component in this architecture would be MP Proxy (Multipath Proxy) and this part is being defined in IETF (Ref [12] )\n\nAs of now (Jan 2015), I don't have any specific information other than Integrated wireless railway network to be commercialized .\n\n[1] LTE-U/LAA, MuLTEfire and Wi-Fi; making best use of unlicensed spectrum (Qualcomm)\n\n[9] Cracking Google Project Fi & LTE/Wi-Fi Aggregation with Qualcomm - Wi-Fi Now Episode 5 (YouTube)\n\n[10] The LTE-U vs. Wi-Fi debate continues empowering carriers with seamless Wi-Fi - Wi-Fi Now Episode 15 (YouYube)\n\n[15] ETSI EN 300 328 Wideband transmission systems;Data transmission equipment operating in the 2,4 GHz ISM band and using wide band modulation techniques;",

You may find a lot of illustrations, cartoons on eCall from internet and following is my own version of illustration. I put the number labels on each of the steps and I would put a short descriptions on what's happening at each step.\n\n(2) eCall is triggered. eCall can be triggered in many ways. It can be triggered automatically by Air Bag or internal sensors. Or a person (e.g, driver) in the car can push the emergency button in the car to trigger the eCall.\n\n(3) The eCall device installed in the car (called IVS : In-Vehicle System) go through Emergency Voice Call setup process to establish the voice call channel. Once the voice call channel is established, the IVS send eCall Data (MSD : Minimal Set of Data) to PSAP (Public Safety Answering Point)\n\n(4) Once the eCall Data(MSD) is received by PSAP, the information would show up automatically on the screen at PSAP center.\n\n(5) The personnel at PSAP center may try voice contact to the person in the car if possible. But there would be many cases where this is not possible when person in the car is injured badly.\n\nFor those who came from Cellular protocol and new to eCall, it would be a little confusing on figuring out the difference between eCall and another type of Emergency Call (like 911 in North America) which we are familiar with in daily life. For those people, I think it would be easier / clearer to explain the difference in terms of overall protocol sequence. Following is my understanding (the image formed in my brain when I first got trained about this).\n\nAs you see here in the following illustration, there is common portions and different portions between eCall and Emergency Call.\n\nNOTE : IVS stands for In-Vehicle System. It is the eCall / Cellular module that are installed within Car (within Telematics module in most case). In terms of testing, this is a DUT\n\neCall Higher Layer Application Protocol (HLAP) is very simple (at least comparting to Cellular Protocol). Actually there is only one critical data to be transferred. The critical data is called MSD(Minimal Set of Data). All the remaining part is just to get MSD delivered to PSAP (Emergency Call Center) with reliability.\n\nAs in Cellular Voice Call, in HLAP there are two different type of call mode depending on who (IVS or PSAP) initiates call. The eCall initiated by IVS is called 'PUSH mode' and this is similar concept as MO(Mobile Originating) call in cellular voice call.\n\nThe eCall initiated by PSAP is called 'PULL mode' and this is similar concept as MT(Mobile Terminating) call in cellular voice call.\n\nThe two illustrations in this section is based on ETSI 103.428 Figure 2. The ETSI diagram is a single diagram showing both PUSH and PULL mode in single sequence. It looked a little confusing to me, so I split the digram into two separate diagram as shown below.\n\nNOTE 1 : IVS stands for In-Vehicle System. It is the eCall / Cellular module that are installed within Car (within Telematics module in most case). In terms of testing, this is a DUT\n\nNOTE 2 : PSAP stands for Public Safety Answering Point. This is a kind of Emergency Call Center.\n\nPSAP PUSH Mode Call is like MO call in celluar terminology. This is the call initiated by IVS (the mobile unit installed inside the car). I think in most case of eCall, the eCall goes in PUSH mode as illustrated below.\n\nPSAP PUSH Mode Call is like MT call in celluar terminology. This is the call initiated by PSAP (the call center). If you compare this with PUSH mode sequence, you would notice that most of the part are same. The only difference is the SEND-MSD (START) signal before the Initiation signal. This is also very much like cellular protocol. If you compare the MO Call and MT Call sequence in cellular protocol, you would notice that most part of the two are almost same. The main difference is that in MT Call the cellular network send 'Paging' (a kind of trigger for UE to initiate the call).\n\nAnother sequence that illustrate the eCall process with a little low layer point of view (especially in terms of LL/HL ACK operation) is shown below. This applies to both PUSH and PULL model.\n\n< ETSI TR 126.969 - Figure 1: Timeline of eCall with IVS initiated signalling and HL-ACK in normal operation >\n\nThere are various timers in eCall protocol which should be met in order to guarantee the normal functionality of the eCall. Some of these timers are an important criterial of testing eCall functionality.\n\nAs mentioned above, the only one fundamental goal for eCall is to deliver MSD(Minimal Set of Data) with reliability. Then you may ask what kind of information is in the MSD. High level description of the imformation in MSD can be find from following description. As you see, the most important information in the MSD is the location data and vehicle information.\n\nThe eCall modem allows to transfer a data message from the IVS over the cellular network to the PSAP which is denoted as eCall MSD. The MSD can include, e.g. vehicle location information, time stamp, number of passengers, Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), and other relevant accident information\n\nThe Minimum Set of Data forming the data component of an eCall sent from a vehicle to a Public Safety Answering Point or other designated emergency call centre. The MSD has a maximum size of 140 bytes and includes, for example, vehicle identity, location information and time-stamp.\n\nBefore we think of this, let's think of why we need to care of this. We should care of this because eCall signaling message and data are delivered in the form of Voice call data of GSM or WCDMA cellular network.\n\nIn GSM / WCDMA, various different types of codecs are used. Basically the codec selection is a job for the specific Radio Access Network equipment(RAN Equipment) that is communicating with the eCall device. The RAN Equipment (Network) would select the codec that would give the best performance in a specific situation. 'Performance' mean 'How fast the eCall data can be delivered' and 'How reliably it can be delivered under a specific channel condition'. It would be too much (or too boring) to present the full details on these performance here. If you are really interested in the details, refer to ETSI TR 126.969 and it would give you a lot of test data for various different Codecs.\n\nIn theory, you can use a live network and PSAP Simulator to test your eCall Device (IVS). But theory is just a theory. You would come across a lot of issues to overcome if you go for this option even though I cannot say it is impossible.\n\nAnother way of testing the eCall device is to construct test setup as described in ETSI 103.428 section 6 Test Configurations. In this document, it is described to use a private cellular network for various Interoperability and Conformance Testing.\n\nThe most practical solution (Test setup) that will be used in the industry would be to use Cellular Network Simulator and PSAP simulator as illustrated below.\n\nAssuming that you have a test setup and you need to determine what to test. As in most of other wireless and cellular device device, you may think of general test that tend to happen during the development or system integration stage. We often call these test in various different name such as function test, integration test or smoke test etc. Usually test specification / procedure tend not to be clearly defined or the procedure changes often depending on situations. Also those test procedure / test item may vary depending on manufacturer. Therefore, it would not be easy to clearly define on what to test for this stage. However, if you just take a close look at the overall eCall protocol, you would easily guess high level test items even without looking into any specification. My personal version of the guess work about the first level test are shown below. You may come up with different idea, but I don't think there would be any big difference between your idea and my idea.\n\nOnce you complete the general function test during development and system integration level and have a stable device, you would forward the device to conformance test. Once you are at the stage of conformance test, you don't have to worry about what to test because a lot of other people (standard body) put a lot of effort and energy and came out with well defined document. In 3GPP/ETSI, those test procedures are defined in ETSI TS 103.428.\n\nAfter completing the conformance, if you are trying to sell the device (acutually Automakers trying to sell cars) in a specific region (e.g, Europe, Asia, America etc), you may need to go through a specific set of test cases specified by the regulatory body in that specific region.\n\nFollowings are the examples of how eCall is being testing during the development or for conformance test before commercialization.\n\nFollowings are the list of the specifications for eCall. I think the most fundamental specifications are CEN documents. But it is not free to get those spec. Recently 3GPP / ETSI has released various specifications. I think most part of the 3GPP specification are based on CEN specification.\n\n: Describes mostly on physical/transport layer design and process of transmitter and reciever.\n\n: This documents describes on API and parameter descriptions of eCall modem protocol stack. It describes on overall software architecture and API prototype but not show the function body. Unless you are developing the protocol stack, you would not need to read this spec.\n\n: This documents describes general logics on eCall Test, but it does not specifies any specific test cases or details of protocol sequence. If you are interested in physical / transport layer level testing, this document would help you to catch the overall test concept.\n\n: If you are interested in high level protocol and function test, this document would help a lot. It shows overall protocol sequence of eCall and decfines specific test sequences. Most of the test in this document (as of V1.1.1 (2016-06)) are based on CEN EN 16062:2015\n\nRoad transport and traffic telematics eSafety eCall minimum set of data - Draft EN 081018\n\nIntelligent transport systems eSafety - Pan European eCall - Operating requirements",

In contrast to LTE, OFDM can also be used in the NR uplink (UL) direction. As a complement waveform with lower peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) to improve UL coverage, DFT-s-OFDM (OFDM with Discrete Fourier Transform precoding) can be used in the uplink although limited to single-layer transmission only.\n\nTo cope with various deployment scenarios, NR supports a wide range of carrier frequencies (within two possible ranges) and channel bandwidths, as shown in the table below.\n\nTo allow for such a flexibility, NR uses a flexible frame structure, with different Subcarrier Spacings (SCS). The SCS is the distance between the centres of two consecutive subcarriers, and the possible values for SCS are (in kHz): 15; 30; 60; 120 and 240. This is referred to as \"multiple numerologies\".\n\nA consecutive series of 12 subcarriers forms one Resource Block (RB). An NR channel bandwidth consists of a number of RBs. A Resource Element (RE) is defined as a unit of one subcarrier (frequency domain) and one OFDM symbol (time domain).\n\nAs for the time domain, it is divided in 10ms radio frames, each on consisting in 10 subframes of 1ms each, as shown in the picture below.\n\nIn turn, each subframe consists of 1/2/4/8/16 slots -shown in different colors- depending on the selected SCS/numerology.  The figure shows the cases of SCS values of 15; 30; 60 and 120 KHz, while the table below provides the full list of possible numerologies in NR. As shown in the figure for the 15 kHz case, each slot consists of 14 OFDM symbols (independently of the SCS) preceded by a cyclic prefix (CP).\n\nNote that, for the 60 kHz SCS, an extended CP is possible. The extended CP is approximately four times longer than the normal CP and is used for cells having large delay spread. In this case, one slot consists of only 12 OFDM symbols.\n\nThe OFDM symbol duration and CP length are inversely proportional of the SCS. E.g. for 15 kHz SCS, the OFDM symbol duration is approximately 66.6 µs and the CP length is approximately 4.7 µs. When the SCS is doubled, i.e. 30 kHz, the OFDM and CP lengths are approximately devided by two compared to the 15kHz SCS.\n\nNR supports both FDD and TDD operation with the same frame structure. In the case of TDD, and as to allow for flexible traffic adaptation, each OFDM symbol in a slot can be classified as 'downlink', 'uplink' or 'flexible' (i.e. either downlink or uplink). This can be configured semi-statically or it can change dynamically as part of the scheduling decision.\n\nTransmissions are usually carried out over one slot. In specific cases, transmissions can be carried out over only a fraction of a slot, with the minimum set to only two symbols. Such very short transmissions mainly target usage cases requiring low latency, such as some URLLC (Ultra Reliable, Low Latency) services.",

Even though the radio access and the core network signalling in principle supports up to 11 bearers, the UE capability was limited only to 8 data bearers. Since LTE Rel-8 operators have launched a number of new services, and it has become more and more evident that more than 8 radio bearers will be needed to support simultaneously all the services. Without this extension there can be risk of inconsistent end user service behaviour that will ultimately prevent adding further QoS based services for a UE. It also worth noting that LTE Rel-8 has a restriction of having 8 AM bearers or 5AM+3 UM data bearers, which limits further availability for emerging differentiated data services. As an example, there can be user cases and scenarios where up to 4 RLC AM might be needed.\n\nIn response to the aforementioned limitations, TSG RAN agreed to instantiate a new LTE Rel-15 WI aiming to remove those restrictions by increasing the number of supported data radio bearers.\n\nLTE Rel-8 functionality is limited to 8 data radio bearers, which was never revised in later releases. And even though radio access and the core network signalling supports in principle up to 11 data bearers, MAC header design has logical channel ID space only for 8 bearers.\n\nRAN WG2 decided to extend the MAC header logical channel ID space from 32 to 64 code points, which allows for not only extending the number of supported data radio bearers, but also introduces a possibility to add more MAC control elements in the future. After extensive discussions between RAN and SA WGs, it was concluded to extend the number of supported data radio bearers to 15 to minimize impact to the existing information elements on the NAS and CN signalling. It is also worth noting that extended number of LTE data radio bearers is also aligned with the 5G/NR technology, in which the minimum UE requirement is to support 16 data radio bearers.\n\nAs for RAN WG3, it has been concluded that radio access interfaces already can support up to 15 data radio bearers. In addition it, there also exist procedures to handle various error cases when e.g. one eNB does not support as many bearers as has been configured by the source eNB. As a summary, no changes were introduced in RAN WG3.\n\nFinally, it bears mentioning that even though this WI aimed at increasing the number of data radio bearers for LTE connected to EPC, same enhancements can be supported by a UE supporting LTE connected to 5GC, i.e. architecture options 5 and 7. In those deployment cases when both LTE and NR are connected to the same 5GC, it allows operator to deploy and use same services irrespective of the radio access technology that a UE is configured with.",

The untruncated name and some of the metadata are to be retrieved from authoritative data sources by the terminating service provider.\n\nDescription\n\neCNAM does not deliver messages from the originator across multiple networks to the terminating user. eCNAM is a service that resides in the terminating service provider's (SP) network, most likely in the Telephony Application Server (TAS). However, it utilizes the identity information received in SIP signalling.\n\nThe untruncated name is delivered in the \"display-name\" parameter of the From header field and/or P-Asserted-Identity header field that the terminating Application Server sends to the terminating UE.\n\nThe metadata will be delivered in one or more Call-Info header field(s). The eCNAM service logic in the AS assembles and formats several data elements (subject to local policy). eCNAM metadata may include type of call, location of a business, or language of the originator. Furthermore, eCNAM metadata may include the results of robocalling analytics that are used to alert the subscriber of possible scams. Typically, service providers partner with analytics providers that offer risk indicators about incoming calls (e.g., known scammers). The results of such analytics are relayed to the user in the form of text strings and/or icons to be displayed on his/her UE. The eCNAM Call-Info header fields support the delivery of text and icons. Given the changing nature of scams, the results of the analytics are expected to vary. eCNAM provides the advantage of a flexible \"envelope\" - namely the Call-Info header field(s) - that delivers different types of payload without having to modify existing standards frequently.\n\nReferences",

In order to support these charging mechanisms, the network performs real-time monitoring of resource usage on the above three levels in order to detect the relevant chargeable events. The charging levels are further described in clause 5.3.\n\nIn offline charging, the resource usage is reported from the network to the BD after the resource usage has occurred. In online charging, a subscriber account, located in an OCS or CCS, is queried prior to granting permission to use the requested network resource(s).\n\nTypical examples of network resource usage are a voice call of certain duration, the transport of a certain volume of data, or the submission of a MM of a certain size. The network resource usage requests may be initiated by the UE (MO case) or by the network (MT case).\n\nOffline and online charging may be performed simultaneously and independently for the same chargeable event. Clause 5.5 provides further insight into potential utilisation of the charging information produced by the offline and online charging mechanisms.\n\n4.1.1\tOffline charging\n\nOffline charging is a process where charging information for network resource usage is collected concurrently with that resource usage. The charging information is then passed through a chain of logical charging functions that are further explained in clause 4.3.1 and clause 4.3.3. At the end of this process, CDR files are generated by the network, which are then transferred to the network operator's BD for the purpose of subscriber billing and/or inter-operator accounting (or additional functions, e.g. statistics, at the operator's discretion). The BD typically comprises post-processing systems such as the operator's billing system or billing mediation device.\n\nIn conclusion, offline charging is a mechanism where charging information does not affect, in real-time, the service rendered.\n\n4.1.2\tOnline charging\n\nOnline charging is a process where charging information for network resource usage is collected concurrently with that resource usage in the same fashion as in offline charging. However, authorization for the network resource usage must be obtained by the network prior to the actual resource usage to occur. This authorization is granted by the OCS or CCS upon request from the network.\n\nWhen receiving a network resource usage request, the network assembles the relevant charging information and generates a charging event towards the OCS or CCS in real-time. The OCS or CCS then returns an appropriate resource usage authorization. The resource usage authorization may be limited in its scope (e.g. volume of data or duration), therefore the authorization may have to be renewed from time to time as long as the user's network resource usage persists.\n\nNote that the charging information utilized in online charging is not necessarily identical to the charging information employed in offline charging.\n\nIn conclusion, online charging is a mechanism where charging information can affect, in real-time, the service rendered and therefore a direct interaction of the charging mechanism with the control of network resource usage is required.\n\n4.1.3\tConverged charging\n\nConverged charging is a process where online and offline charging are combined. The charging information is utilized by CCS in one converged charging service which offers charging with and without quota management, as well as charging information record generation.",

Tech.: Convolution\n\nAs you know, a most typical approach to almost any of the engineering field is to draw out a mathematical model for each component of a system and combine all of the mathematical components to describe the whole system.\n\nLet's assume that we built a mathematical model for each compoenent of a communication system as shown below. As you see, we have a mathematical model named as X which is the model for the signal from a transmitter. and we have another mathematical model named as Y which is for Recieved signal. and we have the model H which is for the channel.\n\nAs I described above, we have the mathematical model for each component of the system. Now the question is how do we combine these componend model to make it for the whole system ?\n\nPartly by intuition and partly by our common sense, we would guess that 'combining X and Y in some format' should produce Y. Then the next question is 'How to combine X and Y' ?\n\nThe first guess would be to try with basic operators like +,-,x,/. Let's think about basic property of these operation. My personal image of these operators are as shown below. Can you make any sense out of this ? Probably no. What I am trying to say with this illustration is \"one lement of Y is created by only one element of X and only one element of H\". Basically they are one\nto one operation. It means that a specific elements in Y is only influenced by only one specific elements in H and Y.\n\nAccording to research and experiments, the received signal is not calculated by this kind of one-to-one operation as described above. In reality, one element in X is influenced by many other elements in X and Y. If I express this in an illustration, it would be as shown below.\n\nYou might not haven't seen this kind of operation in high school math, but this kind of operation is very common to various engineering field and this would give you a lot of hard time at entering the university level engineering because you have never been familiar with this kind of operation in high school math.\n\nThe most commonly used operator which is operating like this is 'Convolution'. The convolution can be described as shown below. The symbol '*' represents 'Convolution'. (Don't get confused with multiplication symbol that you use in your computer software).\n\nFor further detailed description of Convolution, refer to Convolution section of Engineering Math.\n\nConvolution is a mathematical operator which gives the result when a sequence of a data goes through a specific process. Basically each elements of an output sequence is influenced by many previous element of input sequence and all the elements within the process the signal is going through. At the beginning, this would be very confusing cocept and just any of single explanation and\nlecture would never give you complete understanding for it. I am pretty sure that my explanation here would not give you the complete understanding if this is the first time for you to hear about 'Convolution', but if you have gone through many other resources before, i am pretty sure that my explanation would give you some additional insight and clarification. I stronly recomment you to try googling 'Convolution' and it would give you a lot of explanation with a little bit different aspects. You would find\nsome Java applets or animation showing the concept of Counvolution. Even in YouTube, you would get a lot of lectures about Convolution. Try all those materials as much as possible.\n\nEven though you have understandings of Convolution in mathematical sense, you would not have your own intuitive understandings of the concept without a lot of practice. Unlike the simple mathemtical operators like +,-,x,/ it would be very difficult to do practice about Convolution just by pen and paper since the calulation process is so complicated.\n\nTo help you with the practice, I would give you a short Matlab/Octave script. Try changing the vector x and chann and see how the outcome changes. Try to make your own association (relation) between input(x), chann and output(y).\n\nI strongly, strongly recommend you to try this on your own with pen and paper until you grasp the meaning of the process. (I posted the excel spreadsheet for this process. You can get it from here and try wth different values for f(n), g(n))\n\nWhen you complete this whole process, collect the values shown in red cell on right side and place it in a raw from left to right. That is the final result of convolution.\n\nIf you think you got the complete understanding of the process shown above. Try followings by your hand and see if your answer is correct.\n\nx = [0 1 0 1 0 1]; % Change this array if you want to change input sequence (transmitted data)\n\nchan = [0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0]; % Change this array if you want to change the characteristics of channel\n\nsubplot(2,5,3);stem(chan,'MarkerFaceColor',[0 0 1]);axis([1 length(chan) -1.5 1.5]);title(\"chan\");\n\nsubplot(2,5,8);stem(chan,'MarkerFaceColor',[0 0 1]);axis([1 length(chan) -1.5 1.5]);title(\"chan\");\n\nNow let's look at the first example. The input (tx signal) is a typtical rectangular pulse that you see in various electrical engineering books. The channel has 10 elements in it and only the first item is nonzero value 1 and all the other elements are set as '0'. Here the channel is a process which is manipulating the input sequence.\n\nLook at the output. The output(rx signal) is the result of convolution of input(tx signal) and chan. You see there is no difference at all between the input and output. It means the channel in this example is just passing through the input sequence without any modification.\n\nNow let's look at another example. The input (tx signal) is a typtical rectangular pulse that you see in various electrical engineering books. The channel has 10 elements in it and only the first item is nonzero value 0.5 and all the other elements are set as '0'. Here the channel is a process which is manipulating the input sequence.\n\nLook at the output. The output(rx signal) is the result of convolution of input(tx signal) and chan. You see there is no difference in terms of overall shape but the amplitude of output is half (0.5 times) of the input signal.\n\nLet's look at another example. The input (tx signal) is a typtical rectangular pulse that you see in various electrical engineering books. The channel has 10 elements in it and only the fifth is nonzero value 1 and all the other elements are set as '0'. This channel is almost same as the first example. The only difference is that the position for the non-zero value appears.\n\nLook at the output. The output(rx signal) is the result of convolution of input(tx signal) and chan. You see there is almost no difference between the input and output and the only difference is that there is some delay between the input and output. It means the channel in this example is just delaying the input sequence without changing anything in terms of amplitude.\n\nLet's look at another example. The input (tx signal) is a typtical rectangular pulse that you see in various electrical engineering books. The channel has 10 elements in it and only the fifth is nonzero value 0.5 and all the other elements are set as '0'. This channel is almost same as the first example. The only difference is that the position for the non-zero value appears.\n\nLook at the output. The output(rx signal) is the result of convolution of input(tx signal) and chan. Now you see two differences between the input and output. You would notice that both delay and amplitude has been changed. It means the channel in this example is just delaying the input sequence and changing the amplitude as well.\n\nsubplot(2,5,3);stem(chan,'MarkerFaceColor',[0 0 1]);axis([1 length(chan) -1.5 1.5]);title(\"chan\");\n\nsubplot(2,5,8);stem(chan,'MarkerFaceColor',[0 0 1]);axis([1 length(chan) -1.5 1.5]);title(\"chan\");\n\nsubplot(2,5,3);stem(chan,'MarkerFaceColor',[0 0 1]);axis([1 length(chan) -1.5 1.5]);title(\"chan\");\n\nsubplot(2,5,8);stem(chan,'MarkerFaceColor',[0 0 1]);axis([1 length(chan) -1.5 1.5]);title(\"chan\");\n\nsubplot(2,5,3);stem(chan,'MarkerFaceColor',[0 0 1]);axis([1 length(chan) -1.5 1.5]);title(\"chan\");\n\nsubplot(2,5,8);stem(chan,'MarkerFaceColor',[0 0 1]);axis([1 length(chan) -1.5 1.5]);title(\"chan\");\n\nNote : I posted a visual note in slideshow and animation format to show the concept of this example to give you more intuitive understanding. Check [Engineering]->[1]->[Convolution] in www.slide4math.com\n\nThere would be no real system (no real channel) which is simple as simple as described above, but the example shown above would be a good example to help you understand very basic properties of Convolution.\n\nx = [0 1 0 1 0 1]; % Change this array if you want to change input sequence (transmitted data)\n\nchan = [[0 0 0 0 0] chan]; % Change this array if you want to change the characteristics of channel\n\nsubplot(2,5,3);stem(chan,'MarkerFaceColor',[0 0 1]);axis([1 length(chan) -0.5 0.5]);title(\"chan\");\n\nsubplot(2,5,8);stem(chan,'MarkerFaceColor',[0 0 1]);axis([1 length(chan) -0.5 0.5]);title(\"chan\");\n\nNote : I posted a visual note in slideshow and animation format to show the concept of this example to give you more intuitive understanding. Check [Engineering]->[1]->[Convolution] in www.slide4math.com\n\nOne simple example is as follows. As you see, the input is the same as the ones we used in previous examples. You would notice that the values in channel is much more complex than the ones we saw in previous examples. And the result is as shown below. If you already have gone through any basic electronic course, you would notice that the output is very similar to the case where a rectangular\npulse is going through a capacitance circuit.\n\nLet me give you another example. As you see, the input is the same as the ones we used in previous examples. You would notice that the values in channel is similar to previous example and the only difference is that you have some zeros at the beginning of channel sequence. And the result is as shown below. You see the overal shape of the output (rx signal) is same as the one you saw in previous\nexample, but you would notice that a delay was introduced in this example.\n\nNow I will give you even more complex examples. The Matlab/Octave code for these examples are listed below.\n\nx = [0 1 0 1 0 1]; % Change this array if you want to change input sequence (transmitted data)\n\nchan = [0 0 0 0 0 chan]; % Change this array if you want to change the characteristics of channel\n\nsubplot(2,5,3);stem(chan,'MarkerFaceColor',[0 0 1]);axis([1 length(chan) -1.5 1.5]);title(\"chan\");\n\nsubplot(2,5,8);stem(chan,'MarkerFaceColor',[0 0 1]);axis([1 length(chan) -1.5 1.5]);title(\"chan\");\n\nLet me give you an example. As you see, the input is the same as the ones we used in previous examples. You would notice that the values in channel is similar to previous example and the difference is that we have both positive and negative values alternating each ofther in channel sequence. And the result is as shown below. You see the ringing both at rising and falling phase.\nThis is a very similar case where a signal is going through a L-C circuit or typical transmission lines.\n\nLet me give you another example. As you see, the input is the same as the ones we used in previous examples. You would notice that the values in channel is similar to previous example and the only difference is that you have some zeros at the beginning of channel sequence. And the result is as shown below.

SUPL operations must take place in combination with control-plane procedures over NRPPa.\n\nThis situation could arise in the case of UE-assisted OTDOA, for example, in which the SLP needs to provide the UE (in a SUPL session) with assistance data supplied by the NG-RAN. This clause uses a UE-assisted OTDOA positioning operation as an example.\n\nAlthough the positioning server in this operation is the SLP, the existence of an interface to the LMF means that the SLP can communicate with the LMF via the SPC. In particular, this means that assistance data that was delivered to the LMF via NRPPa can be transferred over to the SLP for delivery to the UE via LPP over SUPL.\n\nThere are several ways to realise this general behaviour. In the simplest case, the LMF could be supplied with the necessary assistance data in advance, so that it can be supplied to the SLP without any actual NRPPa procedures taking place in real time (and possibly even before the positioning transaction begins).\n\nIn the event that the LMF does not have the required assistance data available, it would need to retrieve them from the NG-RAN once it was made aware that they were needed.\n\nIn both cases, it should be noted that the retrieval of the assistance data is transparent to the UE and to the actual SUPL session. This model is parallel to the approach used with A-GNSS, in which assistance data such as satellite ephemerides are retrieved from sources entirely external to the cellular network. For purposes of LPP over SUPL, the delivery of assistance data to the SLP can be viewed as an independent external process.\n\nThe delivery of assistance data to the UE, however, takes place through the same mechanisms as control-plane LPP, transported through SUPL.\n\nAnnex B (informative):\nChange history",

General concepts about transport channels are described in [12].\n\nA transport channel is defined by how and with what characteristics data is transferred over the air interface. A general classification of transport channels is into two groups:\n\n4.1.1\tDedicated transport channels\n\nThere exists two types of dedicated transport channel, the Dedicated Channel (DCH) and the Enhanced Dedicated Channel (E-DCH).\n\n4.1.1.1\tDCH - Dedicated Channel\n\nThe Dedicated Channel (DCH) is a downlink or uplink transport channel. The DCH is transmitted over the entire cell or over only a part of the cell using e.g. beam-forming antennas.\n\n4.1.1.2\tE-DCH - Enhanced Dedicated Channel\n\nThe Enhanced Dedicated Channel (E-DCH) is an uplink transport channel in CELL DCH.\n\n4.1.2\tCommon transport channels\n\nThere are six types of common transport channels: BCH, FACH, PCH, RACH, HS-DSCH and E-DCH.\n\n4.1.2.1\tBCH - Broadcast Channel\n\nThe Broadcast Channel (BCH) is a downlink transport channel that is used to broadcast system- and cell-specific information. The BCH is always transmitted over the entire cell and has a single non-zero transport format. In cells configured with broadcast distribution, a first BCH mapped to P-CCPCH is always present and one additional BCH mapped to S-CCPCH can be configured.\n\n4.1.2.2\tFACH - Forward Access Channel\n\nThe Forward Access Channel (FACH) is a downlink transport channel. The FACH is transmitted over the entire cell. The FACH can be transmitted using power setting described in [16].\n\n4.1.2.3\tPCH - Paging Channel\n\nThe Paging Channel (PCH) is a downlink transport channel. The PCH is always transmitted over the entire cell. The transmission of the PCH is associated with the transmission of physical-layer generated Paging Indicators, to support efficient sleep-mode procedures.\n\n4.1.2.4\tRACH - Random Access Channel\n\nThe Random Access Channel (RACH) is an uplink transport channel. The RACH is always received from the entire cell. The RACH is characterized by a collision risk and by being transmitted using open loop power control.\n\n4.1.2.7\tHS-DSCH - High Speed Downlink Shared Channel\n\nThe High Speed Downlink Shared Channel is a downlink transport channel shared by several UEs. The HS-DSCH can be associated with one downlink DPCH or F-DPCH, and one or several Shared Control Channels (HS-SCCH). The HS-DSCH is transmitted over the entire cell or over only part of the cell using e.g. beam-forming antennas.\n\n4.1.2.7A\tE-DCH - Enhanced Dedicated Channel\n\nThe Enhanced Dedicated Channel (E-DCH) is an uplink transport channel in CELL_FACH state and IDLE mode.\n\n4.2\tIndicators\n\nIndicators are means of fast low-level signalling entities which are transmitted without using information blocks sent over transport channels. The meaning of indicators is specific to the type of indicator.\n\nThe indicators defined in the current version of the specifications are: Acquisition Indicator (AI), Page Indicator (PI) and MBMS Notification Indicator (NI).\n\nIndicators may be either boolean (two-valued) or three-valued. Their mapping to indicator channels is channel specific.\n\nIndicators are transmitted on those physical channels that are indicator channels (ICH).",

The SON architecture can be a centralized, distributed or a hybrid solution.\n\nThis is the dynamic plug-and-play configuration of newly deployed eNBs. The eNB will by itself configure the Physical Cell Identity, transmission frequency and power, leading to faster cell planning and rollout.\n\nThe interfaces S1 and X2 are dynamically configured, as well as the IP address and connection to IP backhaul. To reduce manual work ANR (Automatic neighbour relations) is used. ANR configures the neighbouring list in newly deployed eNBs and is optimizing the list configuration during operation.\n\nDynamic configuration includes the configuration of the Layer 1 identifier, Physical cell identity (PCI) and Cell global ID (CGID). There are 504 different PCIs available in LTE, the PCI mapping shall fulfill the collision free condition as well as the confusion free. The PCI can be assigned either in a centralized or distributed way.\n\nWhen centralised assignment is used the OAM system will have a complete knowledge and control of the PCIs. When the distributed solution is used the OAM system assigns a list of possible PCIs to the newly deployed eNB, but the adoption of the PCI is in control of the eNB. The newly deployed eNB will request a report, sent either by User Equipment (UEs) over the air interface or by other eNBs over the X2 interface, including already in-use PCIs, see figure 1. - The eNB will randomly select its PCI from the remaining values.\n\nANR is used to minimize the work required for configuration in newly deployed eNBs as well as to optimize configuration during operation. Correct and up-to-date neighbouring lists will increase the number of successful handovers and minimize the number of dropped calls. Before a handover can be executed the source eNB requires the neighbouring information: PCI and CGID of the target eNB.\n\nThe PCI is included in every normal measurement report. The mapping between the PCI and CGID parameters can be done by using information from the OAM or reported by UEs decoding the target cell CGID on the broadcast channel in the target cell, see figure 2. The capability of decoding CGID is an optional UE feature.\n\nA network operator can put a cell on a ANR black list, to block certain handover candidates, for example from indoor to outdoor cells. 3GPP has also specified LTE Inter-Frequency and Inter-RAT (Radio Access Technology) ANR.\n\nFunctions for self-optimisation are mainly included in Release 9. It includes optimisation of coverage, capacity, handover and interference.\n\nMobility load balancing (MLB) is a function where cells suffering congestion can transfer load to other cells, which have spare resources. MLB includes load reporting between eNBs to exchange information about load level and available capacity.\n\nThe periodicity of the reporting can be requested in the range of 1 to 10 s. The report can contain, hardware load, S1 transport network load and Radio resource status. The Radio resource status reports are separated in Up Link and Down Link reports, including the total allocation guaranteed and non-guaranteed bit rate traffic, the percentage of allocated Physical Resource Block (PRB) and the percentage of PRBs available for load balancing.\n\nMLB can also be used between different Radio Technologies. In case of inter-RAT the load reporting RAN Information Management (RIM) protocol will be used to transfer the information via the core between the base stations of different radio technologies. A cell capacity class value, set by the OAM-system, will be used to compare and weigh the different technologies radio capacities against each other.\n\nA handover due to load balancing is carried out as a regular handover, but it may be necessary to amend parameters so that the User Equipment (UE) does not return to the congested cell. The amendment must take place in both cells, so that the handover settings remain coherent in both. The eNBs need to estimate how much the cell border needs to be shifted, expressed in dB, to avoid a quick return of the UE.\n\nMobility robustness optimization (MRO) is a solution for automatic detection and correction of errors in the mobility configuration. In Release 9 the focus is on errors causing Radio link failure (RLF) due to too late or early handover, or handover to an incorrect cell.\n\nIn case of late handover, see figure 3, the handover procedure in the source cell is initialized too late, since the UE is moving faster than the Handover (HO) parameter settings allow. Hence when the RRC HO command from the serving cell is transmitted the signal strength is too weak to reach the UE, now located in the target cell, connection is lost. The UE attempts a connection re-establishment, containing PCID and C-RNTI belonging to the source cell, but received by the target cell. The target eNB will then inform the source cell about RLF to adjust Handover parameters.\n\nIt is a bit more complicated to detect a too early handover, see figure 4. The UE has successfully been handed over from source cell A to target cell B, but since it was triggered too early the connection will drop almost immediately due to too poor radio conditions in the target cell B. The UE will then try to re-establish the connection, which will now take place in the original source cell, cell A, since this cell is the strongest one. The UE will use the PCID and RNTI from the target cell B and the source cell A will then consider this as a Radio Link Failure due to too late handover and send an indication to the target cell B. But the target cell B will now recognize the parameters in the indication, as given to a mobile that had just completed a handover to cell B from cell A now indicating failure. The target cell B will send back a report about too early Handover to adjust Handover parameters, to the source cell A.\n\nIn order to save energy some cells can be switched off when capacity is not needed. The power consumption in a base station is not only related to load, a number of functions requires power even if there are no users to serve. But, if a cell is switched off, in the legal operator license there are still requirements on coverage, the coverage must be maintained at all times! The suspension of the cell may occur when the last user leaves the cell, all incoming handovers during this period of time will then be rejected. The cells that remain on, providing coverage, can wake up a suspended cell when traffic load increase. This can be done with a wake-up call to the sleeping cell.\n\nRACH optimisation aims to minimise the number of attempts on the RACH channel, causing interference. The UE can be polled by the eNB for RACH statistics after connection. The number of preambles sent until successful RACH completion, and the number of contention resolution failure are in the statistics. But PRACH configuration parameters can also be distributed amongst eNBs, like zero correlation configuration, root sequence, high speed flag and PRACH frequency offset.\n\nFeatures for automatic detection and removal of failures and automatic adjustment of parameters are mainly specified in Release 10.\n\nCoverage and Capacity Optimization enables automatic correction of capacity problems depending on slowly changing environment, like seasonal variations.\n\nMinimization of drive tests (MDT), is enabling normal UEs to provide the same type of information as those collected in drive test. A great advantage is that UEs can retrieve and report parameters from indoor environments.",

    "context": "https://www.sharetechnote.com/html/IoT/IoT_WhatToChoose.html\n\nIoT: What to choose\n\nNow let's assume that you got the full unstanding of each of the IoT related technology individually and did a little bit of categorization, you may come up with some daisy chain like diagram as illustrated below.\n\nWhat is confusing you would not be the technical details of each individual technology. What confuse you would about 'how one technology differs from other technologies ?' or 'which technology I have to chose for my application or use model ?'\n\nThe simple answer to the question \"Which technology do I have to pick for my application or my use model ?\" is \"It depends on the nature of your application\".\n\nI know.. you would not take this as an answer. You would ask for more specific answers.\n\nIf you want to get more specific answers, you would have specific answers to a lot of specific questions as listed below. (This list would get extended as learn/observe more from various discussions/forums).\n\nI would not put my comments on each of the questions for now.. just to give you some time for you to think.. (good excuse for my laziness :)).\n\nThis is basically asking about the data rate of the end node in your IoT system. Is it collecting a simple data like Temperature, Humidity which takes up only several bytes at a time of transmission. Normally this kind of IoT device should be very low cost. It is less likely to let this kind of device to use relatively expensive network (like cellular network).\n\nThis is asking 'Are you going to use a simple sensors (like temperature, humidity) ?' or some other devices which requires a relatively large packet transmission/reception or which requires very high level data security.\n\nThis would be highly related to Q1. Usually the type of data to be collected and transmitted would determine the necessary data rate, but there might be some exceptions. For example, if you need very sophisticated data security and add a lot of additional portions to the original data to implement the security, the data rate that you would need would get much higher. Another exception can be the case where you want to upgrade/reconfigure your end-node remotely. Of course, this would not happen very often but if you really want to do this, the data rate should be pretty high for the end-node to download necessary firmware and configuration information.\n\nQ4. Does your end node device will both transmit and receive data ? or only transmit the data (no recieve) ?\n\nMost of the IoT application is Uplink centeric (transmission only in terms of end-device) and in some extreme case there are some application that is uplink only. It is understandable for most of IoT application to be Uplink dominant but there would be a lot of restriction if it goes with uplink only. For example, you have a very simple end-device (e.g, a temperature sensor) and transmitted it to a Gateway or Basestation. If the device is uplink only (transmission only), the device can only transmit the data and there is no way to verify whther it successfully reached the destination or not. To verify the successful transmission of the data, there should be some mechanism by which the destination (e.g, Gateway) can send Acknowledge message to the device that has sent the data. To do this, the system should allow downlink (i.e, reception in terms of end-device). Also, if you want to apply any form of data security or remote re-configuration or remote update, you need both uplink and downlink.\n\nLet me ask another question before this .. Are you going to use unlicensed band/frequency (i.e ISM band) or a licensed band / frequency (e.g, Cellular) ? If you decided to use ISM band, it is highly likely to use sub Ghz band (i.e, around 900 Mhz) or around 2.4 Ghz frequency. If you decided to use licensed band, it will be determined by which frequency will be allowed in the area where your IoT system will be installed.\n\nIf you selected unlicensed band, you are free to use any of the frequency .. but it is not only you who is free to use the frequency.. there might be a lot of other devices that uses the same frequency which might cause unwanted interference. If you decided to use the licensed frequency, there will be licensing / permission issue.\n\nIf the transmitter and reciever is communicating within the range of couple of meters or tens of meters, you can use many of the existing short range communication like Bluetooth, ZigBee etc. However, if it should extend to several km or tens of km, you have to use those technologies that can cover wide range like LPWAN (e.g, LoRa, SigFox etc) or Cellular technology.\n\nBasically IoT requires a cirtain type of Network structure whether it is small or large (in most case it is not peer to peer communication). Then you would have question on how to form such a network and how much control you want to have over the whole network. Some people would say 'I want to implement only the end Node(e.g, terminal sensor module) and get it connected to an exisiting network that are already established'. In this case, you would consider Cellular based IoT or SigFox. In this option, you would have less work to do but very limitted or no controllability for network. Some people would say 'I want to implement everything from the end node to the network and I want to have full control over the network'. In this case, you may like LoRa type of technology. You would have full controllability, but downside is that there are a lot of works for you to do.\n\nFor example, SKT deployed a Nation wide IoT service in South Korea around the end of 2016 based on LoRa technology. According to Ref [5], they were considering LoRa, SigFox, NB-LTE(and other LTE based IoT). LTE IoT was excluded for other reason, but between LoRa and SigFox, the controllability to Network was one of the factor to select LoRa.\n\nQ10. Do you need any security for the data being transmitted and received ? At which level, if you need ?\n\nI personally think this is pretty important issue since there are many cases where it is not easy to change / upgrade the software of a IoT end node once it is installed or take too much cost to visit every installation points and change software of the device. However, I don't see this issues widely discussed in the industry yet (as of early 2017). Probably they are afraid to bring up the issues that does not have any simple / easy solution. In theory, the smartest solution is to let the end node device itself to download the new software and upgrade it by itself. We have seen this type of software upgrade in cellular phone (smart phone) pretty commonly these days. We may think of utilizing the similar technologies to IoT devices. However, the biggest problem would be the bandwidth. Most of IoT device is designed for low data rate communication, but this kind of wireless software upgrade would take pretty big bandwidth. So if you think of this kind of wireless software upgrade, you would need to choose such a technology to provide big enough bandwidth for wireless woftware upgrade.\n\nQ12. What kind of protocol (phy, mac, application layer protocol) do you want to use ?\n\nThere are many different technologies that claim to be the best for IoT. Some of them would already be available at your time of deployment, but some technologies would be being talked a lot but not available or not mature yet. So if your deployment schedule is very near, you would need to choose a technology that are mature right now.\n\nFor example, SKT deployed a Nation wide IoT service in South Korea around the end of 2016 based on LoRa technology. According to Ref [5], they were considering LoRa, SigFox, NB-LTE(and other LTE based IoT). SigFox were excluded for other reason, but between LoRa and SigFox, LoRa was selected mainly due to availability. LoRa technology was already there when they were planning, but there were still a couple of years to go for LTE based IoT to be mature enough.\n\n[3] NarrowBand IoT Demystified: What are the benefits and why do we need it?

The untruncated name and some of the metadata are to be retrieved from authoritative data sources by the terminating service provider.\n\nDescription\n\neCNAM does not deliver messages from the originator across multiple networks to the terminating user. eCNAM is a service that resides in the terminating service provider's (SP) network, most likely in the Telephony Application Server (TAS). However, it utilizes the identity information received in SIP signalling.\n\nThe untruncated name is delivered in the \"display-name\" parameter of the From header field and/or P-Asserted-Identity header field that the terminating Application Server sends to the terminating UE.\n\nThe metadata will be delivered in one or more Call-Info header field(s). The eCNAM service logic in the AS assembles and formats several data elements (subject to local policy). eCNAM metadata may include type of call, location of a business, or language of the originator. Furthermore, eCNAM metadata may include the results of robocalling analytics that are used to alert the subscriber of possible scams. Typically, service providers partner with analytics providers that offer risk indicators about incoming calls (e.g., known scammers). The results of such analytics are relayed to the user in the form of text strings and/or icons to be displayed on his/her UE. The eCNAM Call-Info header fields support the delivery of text and icons. Given the changing nature of scams, the results of the analytics are expected to vary. eCNAM provides the advantage of a flexible \"envelope\" - namely the Call-Info header field(s) - that delivers different types of payload without having to modify existing standards frequently.\n\nReferences",

This service component controls the transfer of the trace records from the NEFs to the OSF. The conceptual model is illustrated in figure 5, which employs both the event report function (CCITT X.734 [14]) and the log control function (CCITT X.735 [15]).\n\nThe trace control function collects traceable events within the NEF and formats them into trace records. These trace records may be stored locally within the NEF filestore or transferred to the OSF in the form of event reports. This is controlled by means of the \"priority\" indicator, which is a part of the trace type. If the \"priority\" indicator is not set then the trace records shall stored within the local filestore and subsequently transferred to the OSF in bulk via FTAM.\n\nIf a trace is activated with the \"priority\" indicator set then the trace records shall be sent to the OSF either direct by the trace control function or through Event Forwarding Discriminators (EFDs).\n\nIf EFDs are used then all trace records are offered to the EFDs. The EFDs determine which of the records are to be transmitted to the OSF in the form of event reports and the Operation System Id field in the header is ignored. The EDFs have complex filter constructs, which allow the operator to define the criteria for destinations and filters.\n\nIf EFDs are not used then all priority records are forwarded to the OSF whose address is given in the Operation System Id field. The NEF is required to supply additional information to provide the OS management application entity title.\n\nFinally, the trace records may also be stored in the form of log entries within the log of the NEF. It is up to the operator to decide if the log function is needed in parallel with the event reporting and file store. Once stored, the log records may be individually accessed by the OSF via the appropriate object management functions. Care should be taken of filter criteria for log records to avoid unnecessary overheads.\n\nThis service component contains the following groups of TMN management functions:\n\n9.2\tTransfer of Records\n\n9.2.1\tBulk record transfer\n\nThis group of TMN functions is concerned with the bulk transfer of trace records from the NEF record filestore to the OSF.\n\nThe trace records shall be transferred from the NEF to the OSF by the use of FTAM services. For further details of the use of FTAM see GSM 12.01 [8].\n\nIn addition to the simple file transfer services provided by FTAM, peertopeer application process communication may also be supported. The use of CMIS services for the uploading of files from the NEF to the OSF is specified in the GSM 12.00 [7].\n\nWhen the procedure defined in GSM 12.00 [7] and GSM 12.01 [8] are used to transfer the trace records, the file type shall be traceRecords and the format of the file is given by the type TraceFileFormat.\n\n9.2.2\tLog control\n\nThis function permits the trace record to be stored and retrieved from logs within the NEF. The logging of these records is performed in accordance with the log control function specified in CCITT X.735 [15] and no additional management functions are required.\n\n9.2.3\tLog access\n\nThis TMN function controls the access to the log described above. Each log defined may contain one or more log entries. Each log entry contains a single trace record.\n\nFor further details concerning the use of logs, see CCITT X.735 [15].\n\nThe following system management functions are required:\n\n9.2.4\tEvent Reporting\n\n9.2.4.1\tEvent Forwarding Discriminators\n\nFor shortterm recording of tracing events and for more complicated filter conditions the event forwarding discriminator construct defined in CCITT X.734 [14] and CCITT X.721 [13] can be employed. The event forwarding discriminator construct is extremely flexible permitting the combination of a number of fields and logical operations with a wide variety of scheduling options. The EFD also controls the destinations to which the event reports are sent. Several such filters may be defined and scheduled for operation at different times and for different time periods.\n\nThe following system management functions are required:\n\n9.2.4.2\tDirect Transfer by Trace Control Function\n\nThis function permits the NEF to transmit trace records direct to the OSF. In general the trace record shall be sent on completion of the call or the traceable event. This function is controlled by means of the \"priority\" indicator, which is contained in the trace type. If the priority indicator is not set, then the trace records shall be stored on file within the NE filestore. These records may be subsequently collected via bulk record transfer as described in subclause 9.2.1. If the trace type specified on activation includes the \"priority\" indicator then all of the records shall be sent via trace reports to the OSF specified by the operation system id.\n\nThe following system management functions are required:",

The HPLMN operator will be responsible for all interworking connectivity and call termination fees associated with call or service termination.\n\nSpecifically, the serving PLMN identifier of the UE is needed for the home network.\n\nDetails are described in the TS 32.260 [20].",

    "context": "8.2.1\tBasic Handover procedure requiring a circuit connection between MSCA and 3G_MSCB\n\nThe procedure used for successful Inter-3G_MSC Handover from GSM to UMTS is shown in figure 24. Initiation of the GSM to UMTS handover procedure is described in clause 5. The procedure described in this clause makes use of messages from the 3GPP TS 48.008, 3GPP TS 25.413 and of the transport mechanism from the Mobile Application Part (MAP) (3GPP TS 29.002). After an Inter-3G_MSC handover further Intra-3G_MSC handovers may occur on 3G_MSCB, these handovers will follow the procedures specified in the previous clauses.\nThe GSM to UMTS handover is initiated as described in subclause 6.2.2. (This is represented by A-HO-REQUIRED in figure 24). Upon receipt of the A-HO-REQUIRED from BSS-A, MSCA shall send a MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request to 3G_MSCB including a complete A-HO-REQUEST message.\nThe MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request shall carry in the AHO-REQUEST all information needed by 3G_MSCB for allocating radio resources in RNS-B, see 3GPP TS 48.008.\n\nThe MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request shall also carry the identity of the target RNS to which the call is to be handed over, see 3GPP TS 29.002.\nIf MSC-A supports inter-system handover to a CSG cell and BSS-A includes a CSG ID for the target cell in the A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message, then MSC-A shall check the CSG membership of the UE for the target cell as described in subclause 4.1.1 before generating the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request. If the UE fails the CSG membership check and the target cell is a CSG cell, MSC-A shall send an A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED-REJECT to BSS-A.\nIf MSC-A supports inter-system handover to a CSG cell, the target cell belongs to the registered PLMN or an equivalent PLMN, and the HLR or the CSS provided CSG subscription data, MSC-A shall include the CSG subscription data for the registered PLMN and, if available, for the equivalent PLMNs in the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request.\n\n3G_MSCB will return the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER response after having retrieved a Handover Number from its associated VLR (exchange of the messages MAP-allocate-handover-number request and MAP-send-handover-report request). The Handover Number shall be used for routing the connection of the call from MSCA to 3G_MSCB.\nFor speech calls, if 3G_MSC-B supports the selection of codec based on the Iu-Supported Codecs List, 3G_MSCB shall select an Iu Selected codec from the Iu Supported Codecs List, generate associated RAB parameters and connect a transcoder. If the Iu Supported Codecs List was not received or 3G_MSC-B does not support the selection of codec based on the Iu-Supported Codecs List, 3G_MSCB shall select the appropriate default speech codec.\nFor handover to UTRAN Iu mode, 3G_MSC-B shall also generate a NAS Synch Indicator for the Iu-RELOCATION-REQUEST message. If the Iu Supported Codecs List was received by 3G_MSC-B and 3G_MSC-B supports the selection of codec based on the Iu-Supported Codecs List, then the Iu Selected codec shall be indicated in the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER response, sent from 3G_MSCB to MSCA.\n\nIf A over IP is supported by MSC-A, then for speech calls MSC-A may include the AoIP-Supported Codecs List (Anchor) in the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request to be used by 3G_MSC-B for subsequent intra-MSC-B intersystem handover to A over IP capable BSC. For a detailed description of the handling of this codec list by MSCA and 3G_MSC-B see 3GPP TS 23.153.\nIf radio resources are available in RNS-B the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER response will contain the complete A-HO-REQUEST-ACK message generated from the Iu-RELOCATION-REQUEST-ACK received from RNS-B, containing the radio resources definition to be sent by BSS-A to the UE/MS. If the radio resource allocation is not possible, the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER response containing an A-HO-FAILURE will be sent to MSCA. 3G_MSCB will do the same if a fault is detected on the identity of the cell where the call has to be handed over. 3G_MSCB simply reports the events related to the dialogue. It is up to MSCA to decide the action to perform if it receives negative responses or the operation fails due to the expiry of the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER timer.\n\nIf an error related to the TCAP dialogue or to the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request is returned from 3G_MSCB, this will be indicated to MSCA and MSCA will terminate the handover attempt. MSCA shall reject the handover attempt towards BSS-A. The existing connection to the UE/MS shall not be cleared.\nWhen the A-HO-REQUEST-ACK has been received, MSCA shall establish a circuit between MSCA and 3G_MSCB by signalling procedures supported by the network. In figure 24 this is illustrated by the messages IAM (Initial Address Message) and ACM (Address Complete Message) of Signalling System no 7. 3G_MSCB awaits the capturing of the UE/MS (subclause 6.2.2) on the radio path when the ACM is sent and MSCA initiates the handover execution when ACM is received (illustrated by the A-HO-COMMAND and described in subclause 6.2.2).\n\nIf the BSS-A was connected via an A interface over IP and no transcoding performed in the BSS then MSC-A shall remove the transcoder between the MSC and the other party.\n3G_MSCB transfers to MSCA the acknowledgement received from the correct UE/MS (A-HO-DETECT/A-HO-COMPLETE). The Iu-RELOCATION-DETECT, if received, is converted to A-HO-DETECT and transferred to MSCA using the MAP-PROCESS-ACCESS-SIGNALLING request. The Iu-RELOCATION-COMPLETE, when received from the correct UE/MS, is converted to A-HO-COMPLETE and included in the MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL request and sent back to MSCA. The circuit is through-connected in MSCA when the A-HO-DETECT or the AHOCOMPLETE is received from 3G_MSCB. The old radio channel is released when the A-HO-COMPLETE message is received from 3G_MSCB. The sending of the MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL request starts the MAP supervision timer for the MAP dialogue between MSCA and 3G_MSCB. When the MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL request including the A-HO-COMPLETE message is received in MSCA the resources in BSS-A shall be cleared.\n\nIn order not to conflict with the PSTN/ISDN signalling system(s) used between MSCA and 3G_MSCB, 3G_MSCB must generate an answer signal when Iu-RELOCATION-DETECT/COMPLETE is received.\n3G_MSCB shall release the Handover Number when the circuit between MSCA and 3G_MSCB has been established.\nIf the circuit between MSCA and 3G_MSCB cannot be established (e.g. an unsuccessful backward message is received instead of ACM). MSCA terminates the inter3G_MSC handover attempt by sending an appropriate MAP message, for example an ABORT.\nMSCA shall retain overall call control until the call is cleared by the fixed subscriber or the UE/MS and there is no further call control functions to be performed (e.g. servicing waiting calls, echo cancellers).\nWhen MSCA clears the call to the UE/MS it also clears the call control functions in MSCA and sends the MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL response to release the MAP resources in 3G_MSCB.\n\nMSCA may terminate the procedure at any time by sending an appropriate MAP message to 3G_MSCB. If establishment of the circuit between MSCA and 3G_MSCB has been initiated, the circuit must also be cleared.\nThe GSM to UMTS handover will be aborted by MSCA if it detects clearing or interruption of the radio path before the call has been established on 3G_MSCB.",

Even though the radio access and the core network signalling in principle supports up to 11 bearers, the UE capability was limited only to 8 data bearers. Since LTE Rel-8 operators have launched a number of new services, and it has become more and more evident that more than 8 radio bearers will be needed to support simultaneously all the services. Without this extension there can be risk of inconsistent end user service behaviour that will ultimately prevent adding further QoS based services for a UE. It also worth noting that LTE Rel-8 has a restriction of having 8 AM bearers or 5AM+3 UM data bearers, which limits further availability for emerging differentiated data services. As an example, there can be user cases and scenarios where up to 4 RLC AM might be needed.\n\nIn response to the aforementioned limitations, TSG RAN agreed to instantiate a new LTE Rel-15 WI aiming to remove those restrictions by increasing the number of supported data radio bearers.\n\nLTE Rel-8 functionality is limited to 8 data radio bearers, which was never revised in later releases. And even though radio access and the core network signalling supports in principle up to 11 data bearers, MAC header design has logical channel ID space only for 8 bearers.\n\nRAN WG2 decided to extend the MAC header logical channel ID space from 32 to 64 code points, which allows for not only extending the number of supported data radio bearers, but also introduces a possibility to add more MAC control elements in the future. After extensive discussions between RAN and SA WGs, it was concluded to extend the number of supported data radio bearers to 15 to minimize impact to the existing information elements on the NAS and CN signalling. It is also worth noting that extended number of LTE data radio bearers is also aligned with the 5G/NR technology, in which the minimum UE requirement is to support 16 data radio bearers.\n\nAs for RAN WG3, it has been concluded that radio access interfaces already can support up to 15 data radio bearers. In addition it, there also exist procedures to handle various error cases when e.g. one eNB does not support as many bearers as has been configured by the source eNB. As a summary, no changes were introduced in RAN WG3.\n\nFinally, it bears mentioning that even though this WI aimed at increasing the number of data radio bearers for LTE connected to EPC, same enhancements can be supported by a UE supporting LTE connected to 5GC, i.e. architecture options 5 and 7. In those deployment cases when both LTE and NR are connected to the same 5GC, it allows operator to deploy and use same services irrespective of the radio access technology that a UE is configured with.",

    "context": "3GPP-Specs#25211-f00#18\n\n5.3.2\tDedicated downlink physical channels\n\nThere are five types of downlink dedicated physical channels, the Downlink Dedicated Physical Channel (downlink DPCH), the Fractional Dedicated Physical Channel (F-DPCH), the E-DCH Relative Grant Channel (E-RGCH), the E-DCH Hybrid ARQ Indicator Channel (E-HICH), and the Fractional Transmitted Precoding Indicator Channel (F-TPICH).\n\nThe F-DPCH is described in subclause 5.3.2.6.\n\nWithin one downlink DPCH, dedicated data generated at Layer 2 and above, i.e. the dedicated transport channel (DCH), is transmitted in time-multiplex with control information generated at Layer 1 (known pilot bits, TPC commands, and an optional TFCI). The downlink DPCH can thus be seen as a time multiplex of a downlink DPDCH and a downlink DPCCH, compare subclause 5.2.1.\n\nFigure 9 shows the frame structure of the downlink DPCH. Each frame of length 10 ms is split into 15 slots, each of length Tslot = 2560 chips, corresponding to one power-control period.\n\nThe parameter k in figure 9 determines the total number of bits per downlink DPCH slot. It is related to the spreading factor SF of the physical channel as SF = 512/2k. The spreading factor may thus range from 512 down to 4.\n\nThe exact number of bits of the different downlink DPCH fields (Npilot, NTPC, NTFCI, Ndata1 and Ndata2) is given in table 11. What slot format to use is configured by higher layers and can also be reconfigured by higher layers.\n\nThere are basically two types of downlink Dedicated Physical Channels; those that include TFCI (e.g. for several simultaneous services) and those that do not include TFCI (e.g. for fixed-rate services). These types are reflected by the duplicated rows of table 11. It is the UTRAN that determines if a TFCI should be transmitted and it is mandatory for all UEs to support the use of TFCI in the downlink. The mapping of TFCI bits onto slots is described in [3].\n\nIn compressed frames, a different slot format is used compared to normal mode. There are two possible compressed slot formats that are labelled A and B. Slot format B shall be used in frames compressed by spreading factor reduction and slot format A shall be used in frames compressed by higher layer scheduling. The channel bit and symbol rates given in table 11 are the rates immediately before spreading.\n\nThe pilot bit patterns are described in table 12. The shadowed column part of pilot bit pattern is defined as FSW and FSWs can be used to confirm frame synchronization. (The value of the pilot bit pattern other than FSWs shall be \"11\".) In table 12, the transmission order is from left to right.\n\nIn downlink compressed mode through spreading factor reduction, the number of bits in the TPC and Pilot fields are doubled. Symbol repetition is used to fill up the fields. Denote the bits in one of these fields in normal mode by x1, x2, x3, …, xX. In compressed mode the following bit sequence is sent in corresponding field: x1, x2, x1, x2, x3, x4, x3, x4,…, xX,.\n\nThe relationship between the TPC symbol and the transmitter power control command is presented in table 13.\n\nMulticode transmission may be employed in the downlink, i.e. the CCTrCH (see [3]) is mapped onto several parallel downlink DPCHs using the same spreading factor. In this case, the Layer 1 control information is transmitted only on the first downlink DPCH. DTX bits are transmitted during the corresponding time period for the additional downlink DPCHs, see figure 10.\n\nIn case there are several CCTrCHs mapped to different DPCHs transmitted to the same UE different spreading factors can be used on DPCHs to which different CCTrCHs are mapped. Also in this case, Layer 1 control information is only transmitted on the first DPCH while DTX bits are transmitted during the corresponding time period for the additional DPCHs.",

The location information for each MS is stored in functional units called location registers. Functionally, there are two types of location registers:\nSee also 3GPP TS 23.002 where the network architecture is described, and 3GPP TS 23.008 where the data stored in the location registers are described.\nThe action taken by a MS in order to provide location information to the PLMN will be referred to as location updating.\n2.2\tLocation area and MSC area\nThe MSC area is composed of the area covered by all base stations controlled by the MSC. An MSC area may consist of several location areas. A location area is an area in which, after having performed a location update once, MSs may roam without being required to perform subsequent location updates for reason of location change. A location area consists of one or more cells.\n\nFor further details of the network architecture, see 3GPP TS 23.002.\n2.3\tLocation area identification\nThe Location Area Identification (LAI) plan is part of the base station identification plan. The base stations are identified uniquely (see 3GPP TS 23.003).\n2.4\tIMSI detach/attach operation\nThe support of IMSI detach/attach operation is mandatory in MSs. The facility is optional in the fixed infrastructure of the PLMN.\n2.4.1\tExplicit IMSI detach/attach\nExplicit IMSI detach operation is the action taken by an MS to indicate to the PLMN that the station has entered an inactive state (e.g. the station is powered down). Explicit IMSI attach operation is the action taken by an MS to indicate that the station has re-entered an active state (e.g. the station is powered up).\n2.4.2\tImplicit IMSI detach\n\nImplicit IMSI detach operation is the action taken by the VLR to mark an MS as detached when there has been no successful contact between the MS and the network for a time determined by the implicit detach timer. The value of the implicit detach timer is derived from the periodic location updating timer; when the MSC/VLR applies Mobility Management Congestion Control to a MS, the MSC/VLR may need to adjust the Implicit Detach timer as specified in clause 3.7.2. During an established radio contact, the implicit detach timer shall be prevented from triggering implicit detach. At the release of the radio connection, the implicit detach timer shall be reset and restarted. Implicit IMSI detach shall also be performed in the case of a negative response to an IMEI check.\n2.5\tUse of the term mobile station (MS) in the present document\n\nIn order to simplify the text the term Mobile Station (MS) as used in relation to location management refers to the entity where the IMSI is stored, i.e., in card operated MSs the term Mobile Station (MS) refers to the card.\n2.6\tPaging area\nAs an option, and for paging optimization purpose, the VLR may control Paging Areas. A Paging Area (PgA) is composed of up to 5 Location Areas, and the MSC area is composed of several Paging Areas. Paging areas may overlap each other. The Paging Area is stored in the HLR and updated at each paging area change. The Paging Area is sent by the HLR to the VLR at roaming number request and may be used by the MSC/VLR for paging (e.g. when LAI is not known, after MSC/VLR restart) (see 3GPP TS 23.018 [5a]).",

The location information for each MS is stored in functional units called location registers. Functionally, there are two types of location registers:\nSee also 3GPP TS 23.002 where the network architecture is described, and 3GPP TS 23.008 where the data stored in the location registers are described.\nThe action taken by a MS in order to provide location information to the PLMN will be referred to as location updating.\n2.2\tLocation area and MSC area\nThe MSC area is composed of the area covered by all base stations controlled by the MSC. An MSC area may consist of several location areas. A location area is an area in which, after having performed a location update once, MSs may roam without being required to perform subsequent location updates for reason of location change. A location area consists of one or more cells.\n\nFor further details of the network architecture, see 3GPP TS 23.002.\n2.3\tLocation area identification\nThe Location Area Identification (LAI) plan is part of the base station identification plan. The base stations are identified uniquely (see 3GPP TS 23.003).\n2.4\tIMSI detach/attach operation\nThe support of IMSI detach/attach operation is mandatory in MSs. The facility is optional in the fixed infrastructure of the PLMN.\n2.4.1\tExplicit IMSI detach/attach\nExplicit IMSI detach operation is the action taken by an MS to indicate to the PLMN that the station has entered an inactive state (e.g. the station is powered down). Explicit IMSI attach operation is the action taken by an MS to indicate that the station has re-entered an active state (e.g. the station is powered up).\n2.4.2\tImplicit IMSI detach\n\nImplicit IMSI detach operation is the action taken by the VLR to mark an MS as detached when there has been no successful contact between the MS and the network for a time determined by the implicit detach timer. The value of the implicit detach timer is derived from the periodic location updating timer; when the MSC/VLR applies Mobility Management Congestion Control to a MS, the MSC/VLR may need to adjust the Implicit Detach timer as specified in clause 3.7.2. During an established radio contact, the implicit detach timer shall be prevented from triggering implicit detach. At the release of the radio connection, the implicit detach timer shall be reset and restarted. Implicit IMSI detach shall also be performed in the case of a negative response to an IMEI check.\n2.5\tUse of the term mobile station (MS) in the present document\n\nIn order to simplify the text the term Mobile Station (MS) as used in relation to location management refers to the entity where the IMSI is stored, i.e., in card operated MSs the term Mobile Station (MS) refers to the card.\n2.6\tPaging area\nAs an option, and for paging optimization purpose, the VLR may control Paging Areas. A Paging Area (PgA) is composed of up to 5 Location Areas, and the MSC area is composed of several Paging Areas. Paging areas may overlap each other. The Paging Area is stored in the HLR and updated at each paging area change. The Paging Area is sent by the HLR to the VLR at roaming number request and may be used by the MSC/VLR for paging (e.g. when LAI is not known, after MSC/VLR restart) (see 3GPP TS 23.018 [5a]).",

A fallback operation to the legacy timing of n+4 is still supported by scheduling from the common search space (CSS), while the short processing time is applicable when scheduling from the user-specific search space (USS). The fallback results in possible collision between n+4 and n+3 timing in different/same DL subframe and/or same/different UL subframe. For example, the use of fallback results in possible uplink collision in the PUCCH format 1/1a/1b resource usage for the same UE when the two DL subframes have been scheduled targeting HARQ feedback in the same UL subframe. Collision handling has been specified to ensure a consistent UE behaviour.\n\nShort processing time is configured per component carrier (CC) by RRC and applies to both DL assignment to HARQ feedback and UL grant to UL transmission.\n\nShort processing time is associated with asynchronous HARQ operation on the UL, and hence PHICH is no longer considered for HARQ feedback of n+3 based scheduling (PHICH is still used for synchronous n+4 based scheduling). HARQ processes on DL are shared between n+4 and n+3 based scheduling, while there is no sharing of HARQ processes between synchronous (n+4) and asynchronous (n+3) HARQ on the UL. The HARQ content for a given UL subframe m can consist of HARQ bits for n+3 carriers as well as HARQ bits for n+4 carriers at the same time.\n\nSimilar to HARQ, shortened processing time also applies to CSI, so that a UE configured with shortened processing time for 1ms TTI will measure CSI on a reference resource no less than 3 subframes away (nCQI_ref greater or equal to 3) from the CSI report. For TM10, the legacy value of the delay between the CSI reference and the CSI report is reduced by 1 subframe (nCQI_ref = legacy value -1).\n\nSRS timing for UE configured with Short processing time is such that for a trigger received in subframe n, aperiodic SRS is transmitted in the first available subframe n+3 or later, subject to the given UL subframe being configured for SRS transmission.\n\nWhen the processing time is shortened, the timing advance takes up a proportionally larger part of the overall processing time available to the UE. A consequence of this is that the maximum timing advance for a CC configured with short processing time is reduced from 667 us to 200 us.",

However, the functional requirements for charging are always the same across all domains, services and subsystems. This clause describes a common approach for the definition of the logical charging functions, which provides a ubiquitous logical charging architecture for all 3GPP network domains, subsystems and services that are relevant for charging standardisation.\n\nIt should be noted that this common charging architecture provides only a common logical view and the actual domain / service / subsystem specific charging architecture depends on the domain / service / subsystem in question. The physical mapping of the common logical architecture onto each domain, subsystem or service is described in the respective middle tier TS, i.e. the TS 32.25x, TS 32.26xand TS 32.27x number ranges.\n\nFigure 4.2.1.1 provides an overview of the logical ubiquitous charging architecture and the information flows for offline and online charging, in both referent points and service based interface variants, respectively further detailed in clause 4.2.2 and clause 4.2.3.\n\nThe common charging functions are detailed further for the reference points variant, in clauses 4.3.1 for offline charging, and clause 4.3.2 for online charging, and for the service based interface variant in clause 4.3.3 for converged online and offline charging.

It is less likely to let this kind of device to use relatively expensive network (like cellular network).\n\nThis is asking 'Are you going to use a simple sensors (like temperature, humidity) ?' or some other devices which requires a relatively large packet transmission/reception or which requires very high level data security.\n\nThis would be highly related to Q1. Usually the type of data to be collected and transmitted would determine the necessary data rate, but there might be some exceptions. For example, if you need very sophisticated data security and add a lot of additional portions to the original data to implement the security, the data rate that you would need would get much higher. Another exception can be the case where you want to upgrade/reconfigure your end-node remotely. Of course, this would not happen very often but if you really want to do this, the data rate should be pretty high for the end-node to download necessary firmware and configuration information.\n\nQ4. Does your end node device will both transmit and receive data ? or only transmit the data (no recieve) ?\n\nMost of the IoT application is Uplink centeric (transmission only in terms of end-device) and in some extreme case there are some application that is uplink only. It is understandable for most of IoT application to be Uplink dominant but there would be a lot of restriction if it goes with uplink only. For example, you have a very simple end-device (e.g, a temperature sensor) and transmitted it to a Gateway or Basestation. If the device is uplink only (transmission only), the device can only transmit the data and there is no way to verify whther it successfully reached the destination or not. To verify the successful transmission of the data, there should be some mechanism by which the destination (e.g, Gateway) can send Acknowledge message to the device that has sent the data. To do this, the system should allow downlink (i.e, reception in terms of end-device). Also, if you want to apply any form of data security or remote re-configuration or remote update, you need both uplink and downlink.\n\nLet me ask another question before this .. Are you going to use unlicensed band/frequency (i.e ISM band) or a licensed band / frequency (e.g, Cellular) ? If you decided to use ISM band, it is highly likely to use sub Ghz band (i.e, around 900 Mhz) or around 2.4 Ghz frequency. If you decided to use licensed band, it will be determined by which frequency will be allowed in the area where your IoT system will be installed.\n\nIf you selected unlicensed band, you are free to use any of the frequency .. but it is not only you who is free to use the frequency.. there might be a lot of other devices that uses the same frequency which might cause unwanted interference. If you decided to use the licensed frequency, there will be licensing / permission issue.\n\nIf the transmitter and reciever is communicating within the range of couple of meters or tens of meters, you can use many of the existing short range communication like Bluetooth, ZigBee etc. However, if it should extend to several km or tens of km, you have to use those technologies that can cover wide range like LPWAN (e.g, LoRa, SigFox etc) or Cellular technology.\n\nBasically IoT requires a cirtain type of Network structure whether it is small or large (in most case it is not peer to peer communication). Then you would have question on how to form such a network and how much control you want to have over the whole network. Some people would say 'I want to implement only the end Node(e.g, terminal sensor module) and get it connected to an exisiting network that are already established'. In this case, you would consider Cellular based IoT or SigFox. In this option, you would have less work to do but very limitted or no controllability for network. Some people would say 'I want to implement everything from the end node to the network and I want to have full control over the network'. In this case, you may like LoRa type of technology. You would have full controllability, but downside is that there are a lot of works for you to do.\n\nFor example, SKT deployed a Nation wide IoT service in South Korea around the end of 2016 based on LoRa technology. According to Ref [5], they were considering LoRa, SigFox, NB-LTE(and other LTE based IoT). LTE IoT was excluded for other reason, but between LoRa and SigFox, the controllability to Network was one of the factor to select LoRa.\n\nQ10. Do you need any security for the data being transmitted and received ? At which level, if you need ?\n\nI personally think this is pretty important issue since there are many cases where it is not easy to change / upgrade the software of a IoT end node once it is installed or take too much cost to visit every installation points and change software of the device. However, I don't see this issues widely discussed in the industry yet (as of early 2017). Probably they are afraid to bring up the issues that does not have any simple / easy solution. In theory, the smartest solution is to let the end node device itself to download the new software and upgrade it by itself. We have seen this type of software upgrade in cellular phone (smart phone) pretty commonly these days. We may think of utilizing the similar technologies to IoT devices. However, the biggest problem would be the bandwidth. Most of IoT device is designed for low data rate communication, but this kind of wireless software upgrade would take pretty big bandwidth. So if you think of this kind of wireless software upgrade, you would need to choose such a technology to provide big enough bandwidth for wireless woftware upgrade.\n\nQ12. What kind of protocol (phy, mac, application layer protocol) do you want to use ?\n\nThere are many different technologies that claim to be the best for IoT. Some of them would already be available at your time of deployment, but some technologies would be being talked a lot but not available or not mature yet. So if your deployment schedule is very near, you would need to choose a technology that are mature right now.\n\nFor example, SKT deployed a Nation wide IoT service in South Korea around the end of 2016 based on LoRa technology. According to Ref [5], they were considering LoRa, SigFox, NB-LTE(and other LTE based IoT). SigFox were excluded for other reason, but between LoRa and SigFox, LoRa was selected mainly due to availability. LoRa technology was already there when they were planning, but there were still a couple of years to go for LTE based IoT to be mature enough.\n\n[3] NarrowBand IoT Demystified: What are the benefits and why do we need it?

The position information may be requested by and reported to a client (e.g., an application) associated with the UE, or by a client within or attached to the core network. The position information shall be reported in standard formats, such as those for cell-based or geographical co-ordinates, together with the estimated errors (uncertainty) of the position and velocity of the UE and, if available, the positioning method (or the list of the methods) used to obtain the position estimate.\n\nRestrictions on the geographic shape encoded within the 'position information' parameter may exist for certain LCS client types. The 5GS, including NG-RAN, shall comply with any shape restrictions defined in 5GS and, in a particular country, with any shape restrictions defined for a specific LCS client type in relevant national standards. For example, in the US, national standard J-STD-036-C-2 restricts the geographic shape for an emergency services LCS client to minimally either an \"ellipsoid point\" or an \"ellipsoid point with uncertainty circle\" as defined in TS 23.032 [4].\n\nIt shall be possible for the majority of the UEs within a network to use the LCS feature without compromising the radio transmission or signalling capabilities of the NG-RAN.\n\nThe uncertainty of the position measurement shall be network-implementation-dependent, at the choice of the network operator. The uncertainty may vary between networks as well as from one area within a network to another. The uncertainty may be hundreds of metres in some areas and only a few metres in others. In the event that a particular position measurement is provided through a UE-assisted process, the uncertainty may also depend on the capabilities of the UE. In some jurisdictions, there is a regulatory requirement for location service accuracy that is part of an emergency service. Further details of the accuracy requirements can be found in TS 22.071 [3].\n\nThe uncertainty of the position information is dependent on the method used, the position of the UE within the coverage area and the activity of the UE. Several design options of the NG-RAN system (e.g., size of cell, adaptive antenna technique, pathloss estimation, timing accuracy, ng-eNB and gNB surveys) shall allow the network operator to choose a suitable and cost-effective UE positioning method for their market.\n\nThere are many different possible uses for the positioning information. The positioning functions may be used internally by the 5GS, by value-added network services, by the UE itself or through the network, and by \"third party\" services. The feature may also be used by an emergency service (which may be mandated or \"value-added\"), but the location service is not exclusively for emergencies.\n\nDesign of the NG-RAN positioning capability as documented in this specification includes position methods, protocols and procedures that are either adapted from capabilities already supported for E-UTRAN, UTRAN and GERAN, or created separately from first principles. In contrast to GERAN and UTRAN but similarly to E-UTRAN, the NG-RAN positioning capabilities are intended to be forward compatible to other access types and other position methods, in an effort to reduce the amount of additional positioning support needed in the future. This goal also extends to user plane location solutions such as OMA SUPL ([15], [16]), for which NG-RAN positioning capabilities are intended to be compatible where appropriate.\n\nAs a basis for the operation of UE Positioning in NG-RAN, the following assumptions apply:",

For example, there can be one network slice for IoT, another one for supporting \"classic\" UEs and another one for V2X. More generally, there can be different requirements on functionality (e.g., priority, policy control), differences in performance requirements (e.g., latency, mobility and data rates), or they can serve only specific types of users (e.g., MPS users, Public Safety users, corporate customers, roamers, or hosting an MVNO). The different slices can be used simultaneously.\n\nEnd-to-end Network slicing is a major characteristic of the 5G System. It is supported by every deployed PLMN to the extent necessary to interoperate with other PLMNs, e.g. the IoT slice from operator A can interconnect directly with the IoT slice of operator B. Based on business scenario, the operator can decide how many network slices to deploy and what functions/features to share across multiple slices.\n\nThe characteristics of each slice are defined in terms of QoS, bit rate, latency, etc. For a given slice, these characteristics are either predefined in the 3GPP Standard or are operator-defined. There are three types of predefined slices: type 1 is dedicated to the support of eMBB, type 2 is for URLLC and type 3 is for MIoT support. These predefinitions allow inter-PLMN operation with reduced coordination effort between operators. As for the operator-defined slices, they enable more differentiation among network slices.\n\nA dedicated NF is introduced for slices handling: the \"Network Slice Selection Function\" (NSSF), which enables the selection of the appropriate slice(s). The UEs may use multiple Network Slices simultaneously. The Network Slice Selection policies in the UE links applications to Network slices.\n\nNetwork slicing also supports roaming scenarios. Finally, Network Slicing Interworking with EPS (with or without 4G's Dedicated Core Networks Selection Mechanism (e)DECOR) is possible.",

Primarily, the \"Virtual Reality Profiles for Streaming Media\" specification in TS.26.118 [2] was developed to support Virtual Reality (VR) in streaming applications. In addition, the media capabilities are enabled in Packet Switched Streaming (PSS) Services and Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service (MBMS) by updates of the specifications TS 26.234 [3] and TS 26.346 [4], respectively. The characterization results for audio media profile proponents are documented in TR 26.818 [5].\n\nBased on the findings in TR 26.918 [6], the work item developed the first set of Virtual Reality Profiles for Streaming Media. Virtual Reality (VR) is the ability to be virtually present in a space created by the rendering of natural and/or synthetic image and sound correlated by the movements of the immersed user allowing interacting with that world. Virtual reality typically assumes a user to wear a head mounted display (HMD), to completely replace the user's field of view with a simulated visual component, and to wear headphones, to provide the user with the accompanying audio. In the first set of technologies defined in TS 26.118, VR users are expected to be able to look around from a single observation point in 3D space, also referred to as three degrees of freedom (3DoF). It allows the user to (i) tilt side to side (Rolling), (ii) tilt forward and backward (Pitching), and (iii) turning left and right (Yawing). The specification defines a 3GPP 3DOF reference and coordinate system as well as an end-to-end architecture. In the reference client, it is assumed that pose information, i.e. the position derived by the head tracking sensor expressed by (azimuth; elevation; tilt angle), is continuously available to the VR renderer in order to render the viewport. Based on the system model, video and audio technologies are defined including system technologies (DASH and file format), suitable codecs and rendering technologies.\n\nSpecifically on video, three operation points (combination of elementary stream and rendering metadata) and three corresponding media profiles are defined, namely:\n\nFor PSS, all three profiles are added, the first one is mandatory ( 'shall'), the second one recommended ('should') and the third one allowed ('may'). For MBMS, the first two profiles are added, the first one is mandatory ( 'shall'), the second one is recommended ( 'should') and constrained to non-viewport adaptive streaming.\n\nFor audio, one solution was selected and is documented in TS 26.118, namely MPEG-H 3D Audio Baseline profile. This technology enables the distribution of channel, object and scene-based 3D audio. Additional interesting technologies enabling the distribution of channel, object and scene-based 3D audio were considered, and the characterization results of all proposed technologies are documented in TR 26.818 [5].\n\nIn addition to media specific metadata, system metadata is added to TS 26.118 to support rendering of 360 experiences on 2D screens, including the aspects of rendering without pose information. Basic requirements for a full audio-visual experience are documented under the umbrella of VR Presentations.\n\nThe completion of the work item provides a set of consistent technologies for Virtual Reality in Rel-15 for 5G Phase 1. It is providing a response to the demand identified during the successful joint 3GPP/VR-IF Workshop on Virtual Reality that took place in December 2017 [7], which was an integral part of the development of 3GPP Virtual Reality Profiles for Streaming Applications.\n\nReferences",

General concepts about transport channels are described in [12].\n\nA transport channel is defined by how and with what characteristics data is transferred over the air interface. A general classification of transport channels is into two groups:\n\n4.1.1\tDedicated transport channels\n\nThere exists two types of dedicated transport channel, the Dedicated Channel (DCH) and the Enhanced Dedicated Channel (E-DCH).\n\n4.1.1.1\tDCH - Dedicated Channel\n\nThe Dedicated Channel (DCH) is a downlink or uplink transport channel. The DCH is transmitted over the entire cell or over only a part of the cell using e.g. beam-forming antennas.\n\n4.1.1.2\tE-DCH - Enhanced Dedicated Channel\n\nThe Enhanced Dedicated Channel (E-DCH) is an uplink transport channel in CELL DCH.\n\n4.1.2\tCommon transport channels\n\nThere are six types of common transport channels: BCH, FACH, PCH, RACH, HS-DSCH and E-DCH.\n\n4.1.2.1\tBCH - Broadcast Channel\n\nThe Broadcast Channel (BCH) is a downlink transport channel that is used to broadcast system- and cell-specific information. The BCH is always transmitted over the entire cell and has a single non-zero transport format. In cells configured with broadcast distribution, a first BCH mapped to P-CCPCH is always present and one additional BCH mapped to S-CCPCH can be configured.\n\n4.1.2.2\tFACH - Forward Access Channel\n\nThe Forward Access Channel (FACH) is a downlink transport channel. The FACH is transmitted over the entire cell. The FACH can be transmitted using power setting described in [16].\n\n4.1.2.3\tPCH - Paging Channel\n\nThe Paging Channel (PCH) is a downlink transport channel. The PCH is always transmitted over the entire cell. The transmission of the PCH is associated with the transmission of physical-layer generated Paging Indicators, to support efficient sleep-mode procedures.\n\n4.1.2.4\tRACH - Random Access Channel\n\nThe Random Access Channel (RACH) is an uplink transport channel. The RACH is always received from the entire cell. The RACH is characterized by a collision risk and by being transmitted using open loop power control.\n\n4.1.2.7\tHS-DSCH - High Speed Downlink Shared Channel\n\nThe High Speed Downlink Shared Channel is a downlink transport channel shared by several UEs. The HS-DSCH can be associated with one downlink DPCH or F-DPCH, and one or several Shared Control Channels (HS-SCCH). The HS-DSCH is transmitted over the entire cell or over only part of the cell using e.g. beam-forming antennas.\n\n4.1.2.7A\tE-DCH - Enhanced Dedicated Channel\n\nThe Enhanced Dedicated Channel (E-DCH) is an uplink transport channel in CELL_FACH state and IDLE mode.\n\n4.2\tIndicators\n\nIndicators are means of fast low-level signalling entities which are transmitted without using information blocks sent over transport channels. The meaning of indicators is specific to the type of indicator.\n\nThe indicators defined in the current version of the specifications are: Acquisition Indicator (AI), Page Indicator (PI) and MBMS Notification Indicator (NI).\n\nIndicators may be either boolean (two-valued) or three-valued. Their mapping to indicator channels is channel specific.\n\nIndicators are transmitted on those physical channels that are indicator channels (ICH).",

At most possible occasions for paging, no message arrives for the UE and the power the UE consumed could have been saved. This feature allows the eNB to send the UE a 'wake-up signal' (WUS) to instruct the UE that it has to monitor NPDCCH for paging, and otherwise allows the UE to skip the paging procedures. This allows the UE to potentially keep parts of its hardware switched off for more of the time, and save the power of decoding NPDCCH and NPDSCH for paging. Depending on how long the network allows for the UE to 'wake up' after receiving a WUS, the UE may be able to keep switched on only a receiver dedicated to WUS detection, allowing much of the UE's conventional hardware to remain in a very low-power state.\n\nScheduling request (FDD)\n\nIn Rel-13/14 NB-IoT, scheduling request (SR) exists only as a higher-layer procedure, which triggers a random access procedure to request sufficient UL resource to send a buffer status report (BSR). Rel-15 has added new, more resource and power efficient, ways to achieve this goal which can be configured by the eNB.\n\nFor a connected mode UE, eNB is able to configure by RRC periodic NPUSCH resources for the UE to send BSR, so the eNB is informed when pending traffic has arrived in the UE's buffer. The resources are activated and de-activated ('released') by dynamic signalling on NPDCCH.\n\nA connected mode UE is able to send, in the physical layer, a request to the eNB to be granted NPUSCH resources to send a BSR. This can be done either by a dedicated signal using a pre-configured NPRACH transmission, or via 'piggybacking' the request onto HARQ ACK or NACK transmission from the UE if one is available, by applying a cover code to the ACK or NACK symbols.\n\nEarly data transmission (FDD)\n\nAn idle mode UE is able to transmit data in Msg3 of the random access procedure, carrying between 328 and 1000 bits. After successful reception by eNB, the random access procedure terminates and the UE does not transition to connected mode. The UE requests a grant for EDT if its pending data is smaller than a maximum permitted size configured by eNB, by using a pre-configured set of NPRACH resources for its preamble transmission. The eNB can allow the UE to transmit a smaller amount of data than the maximum permitted size, in order to reduce the power spent transmitting padding bits.\n\nQuick release of RRC connection (FDD and TDD)\n\nA NB-IoT UE has to wait up to 10 seconds, after the receipt of the RRCConnectionRelease message, in case lower layers do not indicate successful acknowledgement of the reception. This feature allows that, in case the UE is not polled, the UE can consider the receipt of the RRCConnectionRelease message to be successfully acknowledged as soon as the UE has sent HARQ ACK. This feature was introduced from the Rel-14 specifications.\n\nRelaxed monitoring for cell reselection (FDD and TDD)\n\nThis feature allows much of the RRM monitoring to be avoided in cases where an NB-IoT UE is stationary and/or the network topology is not changing, and UE battery life can be correspondingly extended. The network configures the UE with a 'NRSRP delta' threshold, and while the change in RSRP its current cell is less than the threshold, the UE does not need to monitor neighbouring cells for 24 hours. This feature was introduced from the Rel-14 specifications.\n\nRLC UM (FDD and TDD)\n\nRel-15 adds support for RLC unacknowledged mode (UM) to complement the acknowledged mode (AM) and transparent mode (TM) introduced in Rel-13. This reduces the need to send RLC signalling over the air for IoT traffic which may be latency and/or loss tolerant, or recoverable by the application layer.\n\nNarrowband measurement accuracy improvement (FDD)\n\nThe narrowband secondary synchronization signal (NSSS) or, on the serving cell, transmissions of MIB-NB on the narrowband physical broadcast channel (NPBCH) can be used for making NRSRP measurements, as alternatives to using narrowband reference signals (NRS). NSSS and NPBCH use more resource elements for their transmission than NRS, and this should reduce the amount of subframes the UE needs to process to achieve a given measurement accuracy.\n\nNPRACH range enhancement (FDD)\n\nNB-IoT is sometimes deployed in cells with radius of up to around 100 km. Rel-13 NPRACH supports cell radii up to 40 km with unambiguous determination of UE range. Beyond that distance, because NPRACH is a pure sine wave transmission, there can be ambiguities for the eNB to determine the UE's range. A new NPRACH format is introduced with a subcarrier spacing of 1.25 kHz and a cyclic prefix of 800 μs, together with frequency hopping, which is sufficient to allow unambiguous range determination up to 120 km.\n\nSmall cell support (FDD and TDD)\n\neNB power classes are defined in NB-IoT to allow deployment of eNBs as microcells, picocells and femtocells, which use lower maximum transmit power than macro eNBs.\n\nReduced system acquisition time (FDD)\n\nIn FDD, when SIB1-NB is being transmitted with 16 repetitions (the maximum supported), eNB can transmit additional subframes containing SIB1-NB repetitions on anchor carriers and non-anchor carriers to allow faster decoding of SIB1-NB and reduce the UE's power consumption during cell access. Compared to Rel-13 which supports up to 8 SIB1-NB repetitions, Rel-15 allows 16 repetitions.\n\nUE differentiation (FDD and TDD)\n\nThe network is able to collect and store in the MME information about the UE and its traffic profile. This can be used to improve the scheduling of the UE according to e.g. its battery life or power supply, mobility, and when it tends to have traffic to transmit.\n\nAccess barring enhancement (FDD and TDD)\n\nIn Rel-13, the network can bar UEs at times of high load on a cell-specific basis. This feature allows UEs to be barred on a per-coverage level basis, so that UEs in deeper coverage levels and needing more repetitions of their transmissions, can be barred separately from other, less resource-intensive, UEs.\n\nMixed standalone operation (FDD)\n\nIn Rel-13, a standalone anchor or non-anchor NB-IoT carrier can only be configured together with another standalone carrier. This feature allows configuration of standalone anchor carriers with in-band and guard-band non-anchor carriers, and of in-band and guard-band anchor carriers with standalone non-anchor carriers. This allows small slices of non-LTE spectrum to be used as a standalone NB-IoT carrier and be linked with NB-IoT carriers associated to LTE spectrum.\n\nPower headroom reporting enhancement (FDD)\n\nIn Rel-13, power headroom reports (PHR) are made by the UE from one of two tables depending on coverage, each containing four entries. This feature improves the granularity of PHR transmitted in Msg3 to have 16 levels.\n\nTDD\n\nSupport for TDD is introduced, incorporating the Rel-13 NB-IoT feature together with Rel-14 features: UE category NB2, 2 UL/DL HARQ processes, multi-carrier RACH and paging, and OTDOA [1]. All LTE UL/DL subframe configurations are supported, except for configurations 0 and 6, and all LTE special subframe configurations are supported. In addition, some Rel-15 features described above are agnostic to FDD/TDD and thus can be used for both.",

The architecture specification (a.k.a. Stage 2) started with a preliminary study in TR 23.799 [4], also called \"NextGen TR\", before being fully specified in TS 23.501 [1], TS 23.502 [2] and TS 23.503 [3].\n\nThe 5GC architecture relies on a so-called \"Service-Based Architecture\" (SBA) framework, where the architecture elements are defined in terms of \"Network Functions\" (NFs) rather than by \"traditional\" Network Entities. Via interfaces of a common framework, any given NF offers its services to all the other authorized NFs and/or to any \"consumers\" that are permitted to make use of these provided services. Such an SBA approach offers modularity and reusability.\n\nThe basic (SA, non-roaming) 5G System architecture is shown below (figure introduced by the editor):\n\nAt this stage, only the following essential Network Functions and elements are highlighted here:\n\nThe other NFs are introduced later.\n\nThe SBA approach enables a virtualized deployment. Indeed, a Network Function instance can be deployed as fully distributed, fully redundant, stateless and/or fully scalable. Several Network Function instances can be present within a same NF set. Conversely, the services can be provided from several locations.\n\nIn other words, when the services of a specific NF are invoked, this virtualization enables to route the UE's messages to any capable entity (within a pre-defined set of equivalent NFs).\n\nThis provides resiliency: any specific instance of the NF can e.g. be turned off for planned maintenance, and there will be auto-recovery without any service disruption.",

It is assumed that selection of a candidate UE/MS has already taken place within the BSC based upon the criteria presented in clause 5. The exact algorithm, in the BSC, for determining a candidate UE/MS is not addressed in the present document. The procedures discussed do not make use of the Mobile Application Part (MAP), represented by signalling function 4 in figures 4 and 6. The procedure described in this clause covers case ii).\nIn case of subsequent handover the following applies. If 3G_MSC-B supports location reporting at change of Service Area and if encapsulated BSSAP signalling is used on the E-interface, 3G_MSC-B shall always initiate the Location Reporting Control procedure at change of Service Area towards the target RNS since no request for Location Reporting can be received from MSC-A. In that case, the Location Reporting Control procedure shall be initiated by 3G_MSC-B after the Relocation Resource Allocation procedure has been executed successfully.\n\nThe change of Service Area shall be reported to MSC-A within an A-HANDOVER-PERFORMED message.\nIn the case of ongoing voice group calls, the handover does not take place since voice group calls are not supported in UMTS.\nThe successful operation of the procedure is as follows. When the BSS (BSS-A), currently supporting the UE, determines that the UE requires to be handed over to UMTS it will send an AHANDOVER-REQUIRED message to the 3G_MSC (3G_MSCA). The A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message shall contain a single cell, to which the UE can be handed over. When the 3G_MSCA receives the A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message it shall begin the process of handing over the UE to a new RNS (RNS-B). The 3G_MSCA shall generate an Iu-RELOCATION-REQUEST message to the selected RNS (RNS-B). For handover of a speech call to UTRAN Iu mode, 3G_MSC-A shall include a NAS Synch Indicator in the Iu-RELOCATION-REQUEST message.\n\nIf 3G_MSC-A supports inter-system handover to a CSG cell and BSS-A includes a CSG ID for the target cell in the A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message, then 3G_MSC-A shall check the CSG membership of the UE for the target cell as described in subclause 4.3.1 before generating the Iu-RELOCATION-REQUEST message. If the UE fails the CSG membership check and the target cell is a CSG cell, 3G_MSC-A shall send an A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED-REJECT to BSS-A.\nWhen RNS-B receives the Iu-RELOCATION-REQUEST message it shall take the necessary action to allow the UE to access the radio resource of RNS-B, this is detailed in the 3GPP TS 25.300 series and the 3GPP TS 25.200 series of 3GPP Technical Specifications. The switching of the radio resource through the necessary terrestrial resources is detailed in the 3GPP TS 25.430 series and 3GPP TS 25.413.\n\nOnce resource allocation has been completed by RNS-B, it shall return an Iu-RELOCATION-REQUEST-ACK. to 3G_MSCA. When this message is received by 3G_MSCA it shall begin the process of instructing the UE to tune to a new dedicated radio resource. An A-HANDOVER-COMMAND will be sent by the 3G_MSCA to BSS-A. On receipt of the A-HANDOVER-COMMAND message BSS-A will send the radio interface message RI-HANDOVER-COMMAND. The UE will then access the new radio resource. On detection of the UE, the RNS-B shall send an Iu-RELOCATION-DETECT to 3G_MSCA. When the UE is successfully communicating with the RNS-B an RRC-HANDOVER-COMPLETE message will be sent by the UE to RNS-B. The RNS-B will then send an Iu-RELOCATION-COMPLETE message to 3G_MSCA.\nAfter 3G_MSCA has received the Iu-RELOCATION-COMPLETE message from RNS-B, it shall begin to release the resources allocated on BSS-A. In figure 9 the resource is released by using the ACLEAR-COMMAND sequence.\n\nIf a failure occurs during the handover attempt, for example, A-HANDOVER-FAILURE returned from BSS-A or IuRELOCATION FAILURE returned from RNS-B, then 3G_MSCA will terminate the handover to RNS-B. Under these conditions 3G_MSCA may optionally take one of a number of actions:\nThe exact action taken is dependent on whether the failure occurs before or after the A-HANDOVER-COMMAND has been sent.\nIn all cases the existing connection to the UE shall not be cleared except in the case of expiry of the timer for receipt of Iu-RELOCATION-COMPLETE.\nDuring the period that the UE is not in communication with the network 3G_MSCA shall queue all appropriate messages. All messages shall be delivered to the UE once communication is resumed. In the case of an Intra-3G_MSC GSM to UMTS handover on 3G_MSCB then the messages shall be queued by 3G_MSCB.",

When BSS-B receives the AHANDOVER-REQUEST message it shall take the necessary action to allow the MS to access the radio resource of BSS-B, this is detailed in 3GPP TS 48.058 and in 3GPP TS 45.008. The switching of the radio resource through the necessary terrestrial resources is detailed in 3GPP TS 24.008 and 3GPP TS 48.008.\n\nOnce resource allocation has been completed by BSS-B it shall return an A-HANDOVER-REQUEST-ACK. to MSCA. When this message is received by MSCA it shall begin the process of instructing the MS to tune to a new dedicated radio resource. An A-HANDOVER-COMMAND will be sent by the MSCA to BSS-A. On receipt of the A-HANDOVER-COMMAND message BSS-A will send the radio interface message RI-HANDOVER-COMMAND, containing a Handover Reference number previously allocated by BSS-B, to the MS. The MS will then access the new radio resource using the Handover Reference number contained in the RI-HANDOVER-ACCESS message. The number will be checked by BSS-B to ensure it is as expected and the correct MS has been captured. If this is the correct MS then the BSS-B shall send an A-HANDOVER-DETECT to MSCA. When the MS is successfully communicating with the BSS-B a RI-HANDOVER-COMPLETE message will be sent by the MS to BSS-B. The BSS-B will then send an A-HANDOVER-COMPLETE message to MSCA.\n\nAfter MSCA has received the A-HANDOVER-COMPLETE message from BSS-B it shall begin to release the resources allocated on BSS-A. In figure 7 the resource is released by using the ACLEAR-COMMAND sequence.\nIn the case of ongoing GSM voice group calls the clearing of resources on BSS-A shall not be used if the resources are still be used on the down link.\nIf a failure occurs during the handover attempt, for example A-HANDOVER-FAILURE returned from BSS-A or BSS-B, then MSCA will terminate the handover to BSS-B. Under these conditions MSCA may optionally take one of a number of actions:\nThe exact action taken is dependent on whether the failure occurs before or after the A-HANDOVER-COMMAND has been sent.\nIn all cases the existing connection to the MS shall not be cleared except in the case of expiry of the timer for receipt of A-HANDOVER-COMPLETE.\n\nDuring the period that the MS is not in communication with the network MSCA shall queue all appropriate messages. All messages shall be delivered to the MS once communication is resumed . In the case of an Intra-MSC handover on MSCB then the messages shall be queued by MSCB.\nIn the case of ongoing GSM voice group calls if a failure occurs when handing over a user on a dedicated channel then the procedures described above may optionally be applied.\nFor the case of subsequent Inter-BSS Intra-MSC-B or Inter-BSS Intra-3G_MSC-B handover the following applies:\nIf handover to an A over IP capable BSS-B is performed, MSC-B/3G_MSC-B includes a Codec List (MSC preferred) in the A-HANDOVER-REQUEST message to BSS-B. MSC-B/3G_MSC-B may select the codecs for the Codec List (MSC preferred) from the channel type information and the AoIP-Supported Codecs List (Anchor), if this list was provided by MSC-A/3G_MSC-A in the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request. For a detailed description of the handling of these codec lists by MSC-A/3G_MSC-A and MSC-B/3G_MSC-B see 3GPP TS 23.153. If the AoIP-Supported Codecs List (Anchor) was not provided or MSCB/3G_MSC-B does not support the selection of codecs from the AoIP-Supported Codecs List (Anchor), then MSCB/3G_MSC-B shall create the Codec List (MSC preferred) using the channel type information received from MSCA/3G_MSC-A in the A-HANDOVER-REQUEST message included in the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request.\n\nAfter successful completion of the Intra-MSC-B handover or Intra-3G_MSC-B handover, if MSC-B/3G_MSC-B received the AoIP-Supported Codecs List (Anchor), MSC-B/3G_MSC-B may send the new AoIP-Selected Codec (Target) and AoIP-Available Codecs List (MAP) to MSC-A/3G_MSC-A in the MAP-PROCESS-ACCESS-SIGNALLING request transporting the AHANDOVER-PERFORMED message, if the following conditions are fulfilled: MSC-B/3G_MSC-B created a Codec List (MSC preferred) from the AoIP-Supported Codecs List (Anchor) received from MSC-A/3G_MSC-A, the target BSS-B uses A interface over IP and BSS-B does not insert a transcoder.",

    "context": "3GPP-Specs#25211-f00#08\n\n5.2.1.1\tDPCCH, DPCCH2, S-DPCCH and DPDCH\n\nThe uplink DPDCH is used to carry the DCH transport channel. There may be zero, one, or several uplink DPDCHs on each radio link.\n\nThe uplink DPCCH is used to carry control information generated at Layer 1. The Layer 1 control information consists of known pilot bits to support channel estimation for coherent detection, transmit power-control (TPC) commands, feedback information (FBI), and an optional transport-format combination indicator (TFCI). The transport-format combination indicator informs the receiver about the instantaneous transport format combination of the transport channels mapped to the simultaneously transmitted uplink DPDCH radio frame. There is one and only one uplink DPCCH on each radio link. The uplink DPCCH may also carry DL FET ACK/NACK signalling information for DL FET operation when DL_DCH_FET_Config = 1.\n\nThe uplink DPCCH2 is used to carry control information generated at Layer 1. The Layer 1 control information consists of known pilot bits to support channel estimation for coherent detection, and transmit power-control (TPC) commands. When DPCCH2 is configured there is one and only one uplink DPCCH2 for all radio links. When DPCCH2 is configured, the UE shall transmit DPCCH2 only in the slots in which DPCCH is transmitted.\n\nThe uplink S-DPCCH is used to carry control information generated at Layer 1. The Layer 1 control information consists of known pilot bits to support channel sounding and channel estimation for coherent detection. There is up to one uplink S-DPCCH on each radio link in the case that UL_CLTD_Enabled as defined in [5] is TRUE. Figure 1 shows the frame structure of the uplink DPDCH, the uplink DPCCH, the uplink DPCCH2 and the uplink S-DPCCH. Each radio frame of length 10 ms is split into 5 subframes, each of 3 slots, each of length Tslot = 2560 chips, corresponding to one power-control period. The DPDCH, DPCCH, S-DPCCH and DPCCH2 are always frame aligned with each other.\n\nThe parameter k in figure 1 determines the number of bits per uplink DPDCH slot. It is related to the spreading factor SF of the DPDCH as SF = 256/2k. The DPDCH spreading factor may range from 256 down to 4. The spreading factor of the uplink DPCCH, the uplink DPCCH2 and the uplink S-DPCCH is always equal to 256, i.e. there are 10 bits per uplink DPCCH/S-DPCCH/DPCCH2 slot.\n\nThe exact number of bits of the uplink DPDCH and the different uplink DPCCH fields (Npilot, NTFCI, NFBI, and NTPC) is given by table 1 and table 2. What slot format to use is configured by higher layers and can also be reconfigured by higher layers. The exact number of bits of the uplink S-DPCCH is given by table 2A.\n\nThe uplink DPCCH2 reuses slot format #1 of DPCCH, and the exact number of bits is given in table 2.\n\nThe channel bit and symbol rates given in table 1, table 2 and table 2A are the rates immediately before spreading. The pilot patterns are given in table 3 and table 4, the TPC bit pattern is given in table 5.\n\nThe FBI bits are used to support techniques requiring feedback from the UE to the UTRAN Access Point for operation of closed loop mode transmit diversity. The use of the FBI bits is described in detail in [5].\n\nThere are two types of uplink dedicated physical channels; those that include TFCI (e.g. for several simultaneous services) and those that do not include TFCI (e.g. for fixed-rate services). These types are reflected by the duplicated rows of table 2. It is the UTRAN that determines if a TFCI should be transmitted and it is mandatory for all UEs to support the use of TFCI in the uplink. The mapping of TFCI bits onto slots is described in [3].\n\nDPCCH slot format 5 is used when DL_DCH_FET_Config is configured by higher layers. In this case, over a 20ms Compression Interval (CI) consisting of 30 slots, the bits in the TFCI field carry TFCI information in the first 10 slots, and may carry an ACK/NACK indicator for DL FET in the remaining 20 slots. The ACK/NACK for DL FET is sent when DL_DCH_FET_Config = 1.\n\nIn compressed mode, DPCCH slot formats with TFCI fields are changed. There are two possible compressed slot formats for normal slot formats 0 and 2. They are labelled A and B and the selection between them is dependent on the number of slots that are transmitted in each frame in compressed mode. When DL_DCH_FET_Config is configured by higher layers, UL DPCCH slot format 5 is used in compressed mode. In compressed mode when UL_DCH_FET_Config is configured by higher layers, TFCI bits represent TFCI information in the first 10 slots that are not in compressed-mode gaps in a 20ms CI. The TFCI bits in subsequent slots that are not in the compressed mode gaps represent ACK/NACK indication for DL FET when DL_DCH_FET_Config = 1.\n\nIf UL_DTX_Active is TRUE (see [5]), the number of transmitted slots per radio frame may be less than the number shown in Table 2 and Table 2A.\n\nThe pilot bit pattern for S-DPCCH is the same as that for uplink DPCCH with Npilot = 8. The Nfixed bits in the S-DPCCH are fixed to \"10\".\n\nThe pilot bit pattern for DPCCH2 is the same as that for uplink DPCCH with Npilot = 8.\n\nThe pilot bit patterns are described in table 3 and table 4. The shadowed column part of pilot bit pattern is defined as FSW and FSWs can be used to confirm frame synchronization. (The value of the pilot bit pattern other than FSWs shall be \"1\".)\n\nThe relationship between the TPC bit pattern and transmitter power control command is presented in table 5.\n\nMulti-code operation is possible for the uplink dedicated physical channels. When multi-code transmission is used, several parallel DPDCH are transmitted using different channelization codes, see [4]. However, there is only one DPCCH per radio link, one DPCCH2 if DPCCH2 is configured and up to one S-DPCCH in the case that UL_CLTD_Enable is TRUE.\n\nA period of uplink DPCCH transmission prior to the start of the uplink DPDCH transmission (uplink DPCCH power control preamble) shall be used for initialisation of a DCH. The length of the power control preamble is a higher layer parameter, Npcp , signalled by the network [5]. The UL DPCCH shall take the same slot format in the power control preamble as afterwards, as given in table 2. When Npcp > 0 the pilot patterns of table 3 and table 4 shall be used. The timing of the power control preamble is described in [5], subclause 4.3.2.3. The TFCI field is filled with \"0\" bits.",

In a previous Rel-14 work item IQoE [1], this QoE functionality was enhanced for the DASH streaming specification TS 26.247 [2], giving the operator better possibilities to control such metrics feedback. The current Rel-15 work item EQoE_MTSI [3] introduced the same enhancements also to the MTSI specification TS 26.114 [4], keeping the QoE functionalities for DASH and MTSI services aligned.\n\nThe enhancements introduced by EQoE_MTSI in TS 26.114 are:\n\nReferences\n\nSummary based on the input provided by China Unicom, Huawei, China Telecom in RP-172192 revised in RP-181821.\n\nThe benefit of understanding customers' experience, e.g. throughput, data loss, latency, for streaming services has attracted operators' attention. ITU-T P.NATS has released the standards on the model and evaluation of MOS models for streaming services in December 2016. SA4 has specified information about Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP, DASH, services to be collected from the DASH application on the UE and agreed to support MDT enhancement option for both QoE metrics configuration and QoE metrics reporting [1].A WI on QoE Measurement Collection for streaming services in UTRAN was approved at RAN#73 and a 'container based solution' has been specified [2]. SA5 has studied the management solution for collection of QoE information and proposed use cases, potential requirements and possible solutions. A WI was approved to specify the function Management of QoE measurement collection [3].\n\nBased on the work above, the operators can collect and utilize the QoE measurement information of streaming services to better understand the user experience and optimize their network in E-UTRAN. This work item specified the core requirement for Quality of Experience (QoE) Measurement Collection for streaming services in E-UTRAN [4].\n\nThis feature enables the network to collect QoE measurement information from the UE. The feature is activated by Trace Function from the MDT framework. Both signalling based and management based initiation cases are allowed. For the signalling based case, the QoE Measurement Collection is initiated towards a specific UE from CN nodes using the MDT mechanism; for the management based case, the QoE Measurement Collection is initiated from OAM targeting an area (without targeting a specific UE).\n\nThe QoE measurement configuration from OAM or CN in E-UTRAN is included in a container of RRCConnectionReconfiguration message and forwarded to the UE similar to in UTRAN. For transferring the QoE measurement report, a new SRB4 and a new uplink RRC message \"application layer measurement report\" are introduced. SRB4 is configured via RRCConnectionReconfiguration meassage. A container in the new message is defined to send the QoE measurement report.\n\nThe QoE measurement configuration and measurement reporting are supported in RRC_CONNECTED state only. E-UTRAN can release the QoE measurement configuration towards the UE at any time. If not explicitly released by the eNB, QoE measurement will be continued in case of intra-eNB HO and inter-eNB HO and both source and target cell belong to defined same measurement reporting area.\n\nReferences",

    "context": "3GPP-Specs#32240-f50#26\n\n5.1\tCharging data generation and quota supervision\n\nThe CTF embedded in all charging relevant network elements collects charging information within the NE concerning the use of network resources by the mobile end users. These network resources may pertain to bearer (e.g. CS, PS), subsystem (e.g. IMS sessions) or service (e.g. MMS) usage / consumption. The various charging levels are further described in clause 5.3.\n\nThe purpose of offline charging is to transform the charging information into CDRs that are post-processed within the BD, e.g. for the purpose of generating bills. While the collection of charging information used for the CDRs occurs during the network resource usage, there is no impact of offline charging on the use of the resources. All activities involved in the transformation of the charging information into end user bills, and the collection of the end user charges incurred in these bills, occur offline to, or after, the network resource usage.\n\nThe purpose of online charging is to furnish charging information to the OCS in order to perform Credit-Control before the network resource usage is permitted. To this end, a prepaid subscriber account has to exist in the OCS, against which the resource usage can be billed. Hence all activities to assess the requested resource usage, to determine its value in monetary or other units, and to debit these units from the subscriber account, must occur prior to or at least, during the resource usage, i.e. online with respect to resource usage. Depending on the circumstances, a final evaluation must occur when resource usage ends. Hence, two cases must be distinguished:\n\nCharging information is collected by the CTF based on chargeable events that describe the user(s) and their requested network resource usage. The chargeable events are specific to each domain / service / subsystem and specified in the respective middle tier TS. For each chargeable event, a matching charging event is formed and immediately sent to its destination, i.e. the CDF in offline charging or the OCF in online charging. Again, the event information is specific to the domain / service / subsystem and defined in the respective middle tier TS. While the accounting metrics (provided by the Accounting Metrics Collection part of the CTF) used in online and offline charging are generally identical, the information comprising chargeable events (determined by the Accounting Data Forwarding part of the CTF) may be different between online and offline charging. Note also that online and offline charging may occur simultaneously, i.e. for the same resource usage the CTF may send an offline charging event to the CDF and an online charging event to the OCF. In that particular case, Credit-Control occurs for that resource usage but at the same time, CDRs are created in offline charging.  Alternatively, if CDRs are required for online charged resource usage, this can be achieved by generating these CDRs in the OCS, as depicted in clause 4.3.2.3.\n\nBoth online and offline charging can be categorised into two distinct classes, namely event based charging and session based charging. Event based charging implies that a chargeable event is defined as a single end-user-to-network transaction, e.g. the sending of a multimedia message. This chargeable event is then mapped to an appropriate charging event, resulting in a single CDR or in a single Credit-Control and resource usage authorisation procedure. In contrast, session based charging is characterised by the existence of a user session, such as a circuit call, an IP CAN bearer, or an IMS session. This user session is then matched by a charging session, resulting in the generation of multiple chargeable/charging events and the creation of one or more CDRs in offline charging or the performance of a Credit-Control session in online charging. The following paragraphs describe the event versus session based charging in more detail for both online and offline charging.\n\nFor both event and session based charging, it has been specified above that the NE shall disallow the requested resource usage when the associated chargeable event is not authorised by the OCS. The most typical case for the OCS to refuse authorisation is the expiry of the subscriber account. However, depending on operator policy, even in the case of account expiry the OCS may determine to allow the resource usage to occur / to continue. For example, if the interruption of the user session renders the complete session useless to the end user, it would be unfair to debit the user's account for the portion of the session that was executed. While the decision making procedures and the special treatment of this situation are internal to the OCS, the important aspect to note is that the OCS must grant authorisation towards the network in order to allow the event to occur or the session to continue, effectively making the event or (remainder of the) session free of charge.\n\nClause 5.2 provides a detailed analysis of the possible relationships between charging events, Credit-Control processes, CDRs and CDR files as well as their triggers.\n\nBoth CDR and online charging data generation and contents should be flexible and unnecessary redundancy in data should be avoided. Clause 5.4 describes how the generation of charging data can be configured by the network operator in order to support the above requirement.\n\nCharging data are collected for successful and selected unsuccessful resource usage attempts. The resource usage attempt is seen as being successful in the network element (where the chargeable event is detected) when the user event is successfully completed, or the user session has started. Further details, such as the indication of failure and failure reasons in charging events and CDRs, are specified in the middle tier TSs.",

Single Cell Point To Multiploint (SC-PTM) uses the eMBMS system architecture, providing enhancements in the air interface to improve radio efficiency and to reduce latency. SC-PTM supports broadcast/multicast services over single cell, and the broadcast/multicast area can be dynamically adjusted cell by cell according to user's distribution.\n\nSC-PTM transfers the broadcast/multicast services using LTE downlink shared channel (i.e. PDSCH), and it is scheduled using a common RNTI (i.e. Group-RNTI) for a group of users. The SC-PTM scheduling is quite agile and radio resources could be dynamically assigned in time and frequency domain by PDCCH based on real time traffic load TTI by TTI.\n\nSC-PTM is especially suitable for scenarios where broadcast/ multicast service is expected to be delivered to a limited number of cells due to user interests and the concerned cells may dynamically change due to user movement. SC-PTM allows efficient radio utilisation and flexible deployment of number of applications, e.g. critical communications, traffic information for cars and on-demand TV services, etc.\n\nLTE Broadcast Test Specifications demonstrate Device Conformity - 3GPP news article July 2015",

A slot transmission is simply a shortening of the current subframe transmission in half, while a subslot transmission consist of either a 2-symbol or a 3-symbol transmission duration.\n\nThe subslot division in a subframe is fixed in the UL while it varies depending on the first potential symbol for PDSCH in the DL, as shown in Figure 13.8-2. Each subframe is divided into up to 6 subslots. Subslot operation is not defined for lDataStart=4.\n\nThe slot operation is defined for both FS1 and FS2, while subslot operation is only defined for FS1. FS3 is not supported.\n\nThe combinations of slot and subslot operation on DL and UL are shown in Table 1. The asymmetric operation of subslot in DL and slot in UL is primarily allowed to improve coverage for the UL control channel.\n\nIn a carrier aggregation setting, an sTTI DL/UL combination is configured per component carrier (CC). A CA PUCCH group should have the same UL/DL sTTI configuration for the sTTI-configured SCells and the cell carrying PUCCH. However Different DL/UL sTTI lengths can be configured for the serving cells across different PUCCH groups. sTTI operation can also be configured in a DL only Scell. The maximum number of supported UL and DL sTTI carriers is the same as in 1 ms TTI operation. Cross-carrier scheduling is not supported for sTTI.\n\nThe physical channels for subslot and slot operation are given in Table 13.8-3.\n\nAs can be seen, although the transmission duration of the data channels (PDSCH/PUSCH) also follows the slot and subslot transmission duration, they are not defined as new physical channels. Except for some changes on the transport block size (TBS), resource allocation scheme and DL/UL UE-specific reference signal pattern, the main characteristics of the 1 ms data channels have been maintained. Both UL and DL control channels, on the other hand, have been significantly re-designed motivating to treat them as separate physical channels in the specification. SPUCCH follows subslot and slot duration (including also SR with a periodicity down to 1 subslot), while SPDCCH has either 1 os, 2 os or 3 os duration, transmitted at the start of each subslot/slot, and may span only configured frequency resources as illustrated in Figure 13.8-3.\n\nA fallback mode to 1 ms transmission is also supported for subslot and slot operation, the fallback is dynamic and can occur on a subframe to subframe basis. The UE needs to monitor both 1 ms and subslot/slot based control. Collision handling in case of simultaneous subslot/slot and subframe transmission in UL on the same CC has been specified to ensure a consistent UE behaviour.\n\nBoth CRS-based and DMRS-based demodulation is supported for SPDCCH and in case of CRS-based SPDCCH, the mapping of the SPDCCH can be configured to be either over 1 or 2 symbols in time (1 symbol illustrated above in Figure 3). In case of DMRS-based SPDCCH, the control is always mapped over 2 symbols for slot-based SPDCCH, while for subslot it aligns with the subslot duration (2 or 3 symbols).\n\nTo efficiently make use of the control resources not used in a subslot/slot, a re-use mechanism is specified to re-use the control region for data, illustrated in Figure 4. Both a semi-static and dynamic mechanism is specified. The efficiency of the re-use depends on the configuration (ideal re-use assumed in Figure 13.8-4).\n\nTo further minimize overhead, the DL DMRS can be shared between two consecutive subslots within a slot . The presence of the DL DMRS for PDSCH in subslot operation is indicated in the DL DCI (present or not). In UL the DMRS can be shared between all three subslots of a slot. The UL DMRS presence and position is indicated in the UL DCI. A possible configuration of the UL DMRS in a subframe that minimizes DMRS overhead is illustrated in Figure 13.8-5.\n\nThe specification also allows for DMRSs symbols to be shared between UEs in the UL, also referred to as DMRS multiplexing. In this case, an IFDMA based DMRS is typically used which allows users of different resource allocation to share the DMRS symbol by the use of different IFDMA combs, maintaining orthogonality between UEs.\n\nAs with short processing time for 1 ms, subslot/slot transmissions are associated with asynchronous HARQ operation on the UL. The processing time compared to regular 1 ms operation and the maximum timing advance are also reduced for both slot and subslot operation. In case of subslot operation, the UE can in its capability indicate the support of different processing timeline sets with associated maximum timing advance depending on the DL control channel configuration (DMRS-based SPDCCH, 1os CRS-based SPDCCH or 2os CRS-based SPDCCH). The processing timelines and associated maximum timing advance is summarized in Table 13.8-4. As can be seen, for each processing timeline set, there are two possible processing timelines (for example n+4 and n+6 for Set 1). Which one to use is under network control and configured by RRC (depending on the timing advance assigned to the UE).\n\nThe number of HARQ processes has been increased to 16 for slot/subslot operation and the HARQ processes can be shared between subslot/slot and 1 ms operation (with the restriction that the TBS and number of codewords limitations of subslot/slot need to be respected in case of initial transmission on 1 ms with a later retransmission on subslot/slot).\n\nA new set of DCI formats, named DCI format 7.x is associated with sTTI for slot and subslots scheduling. Among the specific features of these DCI formats, resource allocation has been modified to reflect the shorter TTI and therefore the granularity in RB allocation is increased.\n\nAdditional functionality also specified in the feature is sTTI specific aperiodic CSI reporting which includes measuring on a slot/subslot CSI reference resource as well as faster triggering and faster processing time for the CSI to be reported. Periodic CSI reporting is not supported.\n\nAlso, semi-persistent scheduling is specified for sTTI with similar functionality as in legacy operation. A contention based SPS operation is allowed where different UEs can be assigned different cyclic shifts and IFDMA combs for the DMRS, but fully/partially overlapping resource allocation.\n\nReferences",

In order to support these charging mechanisms, the network performs real-time monitoring of resource usage on the above three levels in order to detect the relevant chargeable events. The charging levels are further described in clause 5.3.\n\nIn offline charging, the resource usage is reported from the network to the BD after the resource usage has occurred. In online charging, a subscriber account, located in an OCS or CCS, is queried prior to granting permission to use the requested network resource(s).\n\nTypical examples of network resource usage are a voice call of certain duration, the transport of a certain volume of data, or the submission of a MM of a certain size. The network resource usage requests may be initiated by the UE (MO case) or by the network (MT case).\n\nOffline and online charging may be performed simultaneously and independently for the same chargeable event. Clause 5.5 provides further insight into potential utilisation of the charging information produced by the offline and online charging mechanisms.\n\n4.1.1\tOffline charging\n\nOffline charging is a process where charging information for network resource usage is collected concurrently with that resource usage. The charging information is then passed through a chain of logical charging functions that are further explained in clause 4.3.1 and clause 4.3.3. At the end of this process, CDR files are generated by the network, which are then transferred to the network operator's BD for the purpose of subscriber billing and/or inter-operator accounting (or additional functions, e.g. statistics, at the operator's discretion). The BD typically comprises post-processing systems such as the operator's billing system or billing mediation device.\n\nIn conclusion, offline charging is a mechanism where charging information does not affect, in real-time, the service rendered.\n\n4.1.2\tOnline charging\n\nOnline charging is a process where charging information for network resource usage is collected concurrently with that resource usage in the same fashion as in offline charging. However, authorization for the network resource usage must be obtained by the network prior to the actual resource usage to occur. This authorization is granted by the OCS or CCS upon request from the network.\n\nWhen receiving a network resource usage request, the network assembles the relevant charging information and generates a charging event towards the OCS or CCS in real-time. The OCS or CCS then returns an appropriate resource usage authorization. The resource usage authorization may be limited in its scope (e.g. volume of data or duration), therefore the authorization may have to be renewed from time to time as long as the user's network resource usage persists.\n\nNote that the charging information utilized in online charging is not necessarily identical to the charging information employed in offline charging.\n\nIn conclusion, online charging is a mechanism where charging information can affect, in real-time, the service rendered and therefore a direct interaction of the charging mechanism with the control of network resource usage is required.\n\n4.1.3\tConverged charging\n\nConverged charging is a process where online and offline charging are combined. The charging information is utilized by CCS in one converged charging service which offers charging with and without quota management, as well as charging information record generation.",

It is mainly for 5G Radio System. Even though no 3GPP specification about 5G is available, this project will contribute a lot in 5G community. Refer to OpenAirInterface home page for the details.\n\nOpenAirInterface (OAI) Software Alliance aims to further the software towards future 3GPP releases for 5G. The main goal of the alliance is to create an ecosystem of industrial/non-profit/academic organizations to implement reference solution for 3GPP standards. The OAI is striving to become a tool used by both the industry and academic for using community driven development to accelerate innovation in 5G wireless technologies, and to bring the huge economic success to this part of information technology. The OAI targets a reference implementation of Release 14 LTE based on the current 4G implementation and to progressively add enhancements from 3GPP study items defining the future 5G standard.\n\nOpenAirInterface is an open source implementation of 3GPP stack. It covers different parts of 3GPP stack (eNodeB, UE, MME, HSS, S-GW, P-GW). The software runs on general purpose computing platform (for ex. Intel/ARM) and interfaces with wide variety of SDR platforms (EXMIMO, USRP, BladeRF, LimeSDR).\n\nThe OAI currently implements Rel 8/10 stack for eNB/UE/EPC. It runs on standard Ubuntu Linux 14.04 LTS with low-latency kernel for eNB/UE. OAI requires Intel processors which support (SSE3/SSE4), however support for AVX2 is optional. It is also a requirement to have USB3/PCIe on a PC which interfaces with SDR platforms (USRP, BladeRF, EXMIMO and LimeSDR). The code compiles with standard GNU toolchain that comes with Linux. OAI can be also run in simulation mode (oaisim), the details of which are provided by Open Air Usage tutorials on the gitlab server@EURECOM.\n\nThe OAI software packages used to deploy an operators core network, the Enhanced Packet Core or EPC, are collectively known as openairCN while the access network software for base stations and terminals goes under the name of openair5G.\n\nThe EPC is quickly being integrated with other open source software packages providing telecommunication services and solutions for network management (e.g. openIMS, Clearwater IMS, OpenDayLight, Open Source MANO (OSM), OpNFV) on the generic cloud computing platform OpenStack. To ease integration with OpenStack software packages, and because revenues from the EPC are less dependent on intellectual property agreements, openairCN is distributed with a standard Apache V2.0 license, which is quite common in cloud computing software. The access network software openair5G, on the other hand, is freely distributed by the OAI under the terms stipulated by a new open source licence, the OAI Public License, catering to the intellectual property agreements used in 3GPP and allowing contributions from 3GPP members holding patents on key procedures used in the standard. The OAI is working closely with ETSI to harmonise the software licence with the intellectual property policy of 3GPP. The end result is that groups can use the software as any Apache V2.0 software for non-commercial purposes (e.g. for study and research) while for commercial exploitation of the community software, users are bound to respect intellectual property agreements associated with the 3GPP standard as with proprietary hardware and software. For details on OAI licensing model, please refer to OAI License Model page.\n\nSince, the evolution of 5G is still under discussion within academia/industry, we plan to identify different areas in which different members of the alliance create projects. The projects are created with the goal of furthering these strategic areas within the alliance and making sure the output of the project is merged back with the main repository at some point. The strategic areas of the alliance ratified by the board are listed here.\n\nIn order to install OAI successfully, it is important to follow HW/SW requirements. Almost all the technical documentation is hosted on EURECOM gitlab server. The entry point for wiki for openair5G is OAI Wiki/Home and the entry point for openairCN is OAI-CN Wiki/Home is here. There are several tutorials inside Gitlab page to run OAI in various modes (Emulation, Simulation, real-time with COTS UE, etc). The mailing lists for both user and developer community is OAI Wiki/Mailinglist. The gitlab workflow/coding guidelines/contributing guidelines are here.\n\nOAI hosts several training/workshops periodically for roadmap discussions with the community and also to train the community regarding the software implementation. For more information, refer to OAI Community/Workshop.\n\nThe Alliance offers several membership models for companies, non-profit institutions and individual contributors. The membership is free for individuals/non-profit organizations, however there is fee for corporations. For more info regarding membership, refer to OSA/JoinUs.\n\nQ2. Is there any operating system requirement ? (What type of linux ? what version ? etc) What is Operating System details that has been verified by OAI developers.\n\nQ4. What kind of hardware can be used to run OAI and what are those which has been verified by OAI developer ?\n\nQ4-1. Would OAI be runnable on USRP Embedded Sieries ? (Any verification activity done ?)\n\n[Ans] Yes, but we have not tried it. OAI needs to be ported to ZynQ to run on USRP Embedded series.\n\nQ4-2.There are many different series of USRP. Is there any specific series/model that is not usable for OAI ? (In terms of performance etc)\n\n[Ans] It is not recommended to use USRP N series as it is not able to do LTE sampling rate (30.72 for 20 MHz). In order to use USRP N-series, LTE sampling rate needs to be implemented in software on a PC\n\nQ5. Is there any additional libraries or tools that are required to OAI stack ? (e.g, GNU Radio or FFTW etc)\n\n[Ans] There are additional libraries required but they are installed automatically by OAI scripts (Refer to OAI Autobuild for details).\n\nQ7. Is it possible to develop use OAI as software simulator without hardware ? (Like Matlab LTE toolbox)\n\n[Ans] Yes, it has a simulation mode called oaisim (Refer to OIA Wiki/OpenAirUsage for details).\n\n[Ans] 5 Mhz and 10 Mhz has been most extensively tested as of now (Apr 2016) and 20 MHz is close to being released as well, but theoretically it should work with all bands\n\nQ10.

Operators have met this challenge by increasing capacity with new radio spectrum, adding multi-antenna techniques and implementing more efficient modulation and coding schemes.\n\nHowever, these measures alone are insufficient in the most crowded environments and at cell edges where performance can significantly degrade. Operators are also adding small cells and tightly-integrating these with their macro networks to spread traffic loads, widely maintain performance and service quality while reusing spectrum most efficiently.\n\nOne way to expand an existing macro-network, while maintaining it as a homogeneous network, is to \"densify\" it by adding more sectors per eNB or deploying more macro-eNBs. However, reducing the site-to-site distance in the macro-network can only be pursued to a certain extent because finding new macro-sites becomes increasingly difficult and can be expensive, especially in city centres. An alternative is to introduce small cells through the addition of low-power base stations (eNBs, HeNBs or Relay Nodes (RNs)) or Remote Radio Heads (RRH) to existing macro-eNBs. Site acquisition is easier and cheaper with this equipment which is also correspondingly smaller.\n\nSmall cells are primarily added to increase capacity in hot spots with high user demand and to fill in areas not covered by the macro network - both outdoors and indoors. They also improve network performance and service quality by offloading from the large macro-cells. The result is a heterogeneous network with large macro-cells in combination with small cells providing increased bitrates per unit area. See Figure 1.\n\nHeterogeneous network planning was already used in GSM. The large and small cells in GSM are separated through the use of different frequencies. This solution is still possible in LTE. However, LTE networks mainly use a frequency reuse of one to maximize utilization of the licensed bandwidth.\n\nIn heterogeneous networks the cells of different sizes are referred to as macro-, micro-, pico- and femto-cells; listed in order of decreasing base station power. The actual cell size depends not only on the eNB power but also on antenna position, as well as the location environment; e.g. rural or city, indoor or outdoor . The HeNB (Home eNB) was introduced in LTE Release 9 (R9). It is a low power eNB which is mainly used to provide indoor coverage, femto-cells, for Closed Subscriber Groups (CSG), for example, in office premises. See Figure 2.\n\nSpecific to HeNBs, is that they are privately owned and deployed without coordination with the macro-network. If the frequency used in the femto-cell is the same as the frequency used in the macro-cells, and the femto-cell is only used for CSG, then there is a risk of interference between the femto-cell and the surrounding network.\n\nThe Relay Node (RN) is another type of low-power base station added to the LTE R10 specifications. The RN is connected to a Donor eNB (DeNB) via the Un radio interface, which is based on the LTE Uu interface. See Figure 2. When the frequencies used on Uu and Un for the RN are the same, there is a risk of self interference in the RN. From the UE perspective the RN will act as an eNB, and from the DeNB's view the RN will be seen as a UE. As also mentioned, RRHs connected to an eNB via fibre can be used to provide small cell coverage.\n\nIntroducing a mix of cell sizes and generating a heterogeneous network adds to the complexity of network planning. In a network with a frequency reuse of one, the UE normally camps on the cell with the strongest received DL signal (SSDL), hence the border between two cells is located at the point where SSDL is the same in both cells. In homogeneous networks, this also typically coincides with the point of equal path loss for the UL (PLUL) in both cells. In a heterogeneous network, with high-power nodes in the large cells and low-power nodes in the small cells, the point of equal SSDL will not necessarily be the same as that of equal PLUL. See Figure 3.\n\nA major issue in heterogeneous network planning is to ensure that the small cells actually serve enough users. One way to do that is to increase the area served by the small cell, which can be done through the use of a positive cell selection offset to the SSDL of the small cell. This is called Cell Range Extension (CRE). See Figure 4.\n\nA negative effect of this is the increased interference on the DL experienced by the UE located in the CRE region and served by the base station in the small cell. This may impact the reception of the DL control channels in particular.\n\nA number of features added to the 3GPP LTE specification can be used to mitigate the above-mentioned interference problem in heterogeneous networks with small cells:\n\nICIC was introduced in R8. The eNBs can communicate using ICIC via the X2 interface to mitigate inter-cell interference for UEs at the cell edge. The X2AP message used for this is called \"Load Information\". See Figure 5. Through the \"Load Information\" message an eNB can inform neighbouring eNBs about: UL interference level per Physical Resource Block (PRB); UL PRBs that are allocated to cell edge UEs, and hence are sensitive to UL interference; and if DL Tx power is higher or lower than a set threshold value. The eNBs receiving these messages can use the received information to optimize scheduling for UEs at cell edges.\n\nICIC has evolved to better support heterogeneous network deployments -- especially interference control for DL control channels. Enhanced ICIC (eICIC) was introduced in LTE R10. The major change is the addition of time domain ICIC, realized through use of Almost Blank Subframes (ABS). ABS includes only control channels and cell-specific reference signals, no user data, and is transmitted with reduced power. When eICIC is used, the macro-eNB will transmit ABS according to a semi-static pattern. During these subframes, UEs at the edge, typically in the CRE region of small cells, can receive DL information, both control and user data. The macro-eNB will inform the eNB in the small cell about the ABS pattern. See Figure 6.\n\nICIC is evolved in LTE R11 to further enhanced ICIC (feICIC). The focus here is interference handling by the UE through inter-cell interference cancellation for control signals, enabling even further cell range extension.\n\neICIC and feICIC are especially important when Carrier Aggregation (CA) is not used.\n\nCarrier Aggregation (CA) is introduced in R10, with backward compatibility to R8, to increase the total bandwidth available to UEs and hence their maximum bitrates. When CA is used a number of R8 carriers, referred to as Component Carriers (CC), are aggregated and any CA-capable UE can be allocated resources on all CCs, while R8/R9 UEs can only be allocated resources on one CC. Cross-carrier scheduling is an important feature in heterogeneous networks. Using cross-carrier scheduling it is possible to map the Physical DL control channels (PDCCH) on different CCs in the large and small cells. See Figure 7. The PDCCH, carrying DL Control Information (DCI) with scheduling information, must be received by the UEs at the cell edge; PDCCH may be transmitted with higher power than the traffic channels. Hence, using different carriers for the PDCCH in the large and small cells reduces the risk of PDCCH interference.\n\nFrom LTE R11 onwards it is possible to handle CA with CCs requiring different timing advance (TA); for example, combining CCs from eNBs with CCs from RRHs. See Figure 8.\n\nOne way to ensure that a UE is using both the best DL and the best UL carrier in a heterogeneous network is to use CoMP, introduced in LTE R11. With CoMP a number of transmission/reception points (i.e. eNBs, RNs or RRHs) can be coordinated to provide service to a UE - for example, data can be transmitted at the same time in the same PRBs from more than one transmission point to one UE, or data can be received from one transmission point in one subframe and from another transmission point in the next subframe. CoMP can be used both in DL and UL. When CoMP is used in a heterogeneous network a number of macro-cells and small cells can be involved in data transmission to and from one UE. Especially useful in heterogeneous networks is the possibility for a UE in the cell range extension region to utilize the best UL in the small cell and the best DL in the macro-cell. See Figure 9. This, however, requires that the macro-eNB and the base station in the small cell are synchronized, and most likely it will require a combination of macro-eNB with RRHs in the small cell.\n\nFurther enhancements regarding heterogeneous network and small cells are coming in future 3GPP Releases. At the time of writing, Release 12 is still in the process of being formulated with some features in the study phase and others, such as work on interference management for neighbour TDD cells, dual connectivity between the macro cell and small cells, mobility planning within hyper-dense environments and advances in carrier aggregation combinations already in the normative phase (specifications).\n\nFuture updates to this paper will include what has been achieved with the completion of Release 12 during the second half of 2014.\n\n\"...Coordinating the low-power layer of small cells with the macro network improves performance across the entire network while also further boosting efficiencies in spectrum use and power consumption, automating network configuration and optimization. The upcoming 3GPP Release 12 (due to be frozen September 2014) standardises various capabilities in these developments including dual connectivity, small cell on/off and 256 QAM...\" ...Read the full article",

The downlink DPCH can thus be seen as a time multiplex of a downlink DPDCH and a downlink DPCCH, compare subclause 5.2.1.\n\nFigure 9 shows the frame structure of the downlink DPCH. Each frame of length 10 ms is split into 15 slots, each of length Tslot = 2560 chips, corresponding to one power-control period.\n\nThe parameter k in figure 9 determines the total number of bits per downlink DPCH slot. It is related to the spreading factor SF of the physical channel as SF = 512/2k. The spreading factor may thus range from 512 down to 4.\n\nThe exact number of bits of the different downlink DPCH fields (Npilot, NTPC, NTFCI, Ndata1 and Ndata2) is given in table 11. What slot format to use is configured by higher layers and can also be reconfigured by higher layers.\n\nThere are basically two types of downlink Dedicated Physical Channels; those that include TFCI (e.g. for several simultaneous services) and those that do not include TFCI (e.g. for fixed-rate services). These types are reflected by the duplicated rows of table 11. It is the UTRAN that determines if a TFCI should be transmitted and it is mandatory for all UEs to support the use of TFCI in the downlink. The mapping of TFCI bits onto slots is described in [3].\n\nIn compressed frames, a different slot format is used compared to normal mode. There are two possible compressed slot formats that are labelled A and B. Slot format B shall be used in frames compressed by spreading factor reduction and slot format A shall be used in frames compressed by higher layer scheduling. The channel bit and symbol rates given in table 11 are the rates immediately before spreading.\n\nThe pilot bit patterns are described in table 12. The shadowed column part of pilot bit pattern is defined as FSW and FSWs can be used to confirm frame synchronization. (The value of the pilot bit pattern other than FSWs shall be \"11\".) In table 12, the transmission order is from left to right.\n\nIn downlink compressed mode through spreading factor reduction, the number of bits in the TPC and Pilot fields are doubled. Symbol repetition is used to fill up the fields. Denote the bits in one of these fields in normal mode by x1, x2, x3, …, xX. In compressed mode the following bit sequence is sent in corresponding field: x1, x2, x1, x2, x3, x4, x3, x4,…, xX,.\n\nThe relationship between the TPC symbol and the transmitter power control command is presented in table 13.\n\nMulticode transmission may be employed in the downlink, i.e. the CCTrCH (see [3]) is mapped onto several parallel downlink DPCHs using the same spreading factor. In this case, the Layer 1 control information is transmitted only on the first downlink DPCH. DTX bits are transmitted during the corresponding time period for the additional downlink DPCHs, see figure 10.\n\nIn case there are several CCTrCHs mapped to different DPCHs transmitted to the same UE different spreading factors can be used on DPCHs to which different CCTrCHs are mapped. Also in this case, Layer 1 control information is only transmitted on the first DPCH while DTX bits are transmitted during the corresponding time period for the additional DPCHs.",

    "context": "https://www.sharetechnote.com/html/Handbook_LTE_LTEU_LTER.html\n\nLTE Adv: LAA/LTE-U\n\nRecently (from 2014 as far as I remember), there has been pretty much discussion (even real testing going on) on LTE being extended to non-standard mode of operation (Non 3GPP yet at least up to this point, as of Jan 2015).\n\nNote : In early second half of 2016, I saw a company to try LTE-U device for the first timie, and as it approaches to the end of the year, I saw many companies testing LTE-U devices. Now in early 2017 we are at the stage of testing LAA.\n\nTwo of the technology falling into this category is LTE-U and LTE-R. LTE-U has been proposed and start being implemented in the industry for about a year and LTE-R just start being proposed as Integrated wireless railway network to be commercialized .\n\nAs of Jun 2016, I don't see/hear anything about LTE-R.. but I saw the drastic evolution of unlicensed LTE that created several different technologies (names) to the list. It started with LTE-U and evolved to LAA, eLAA and recently we are hearing of new branches like MulteFire and LWA. I don't know how many other technologies are waiting to be newly evolved and which of these technologies\nwill survive to the end.. some of them are now pretty well defined but there are a lot of other features to be defined technically. I will keep following them up and try to write down whatever has been clarified.\n\nFollowings are the brief descriptions for each of these technologies. I will put further details under separate section if more technical details are published. Also, I put many whitepapers and YouTube links under Reference section. I would recommend you to go through those materials when you have free time and use this page as reminder afterwards. (The contents of this table\nis mostly based on Ref [7] )\n\nFollowings are the list of topics that gives you further details of various LTE-Unlicensed technologies.\n\nIn every wireless communication, the communicating parties (transmitter and reciever) need to allocatie a certain amount of resources in both time domain and frequency domain. However, we don't have much control over frequency domain resource allocation because those resources are fixed permanently or semi-statically. So it is usually not in the scope of scheduling. When it comes to scheduling, Time Domain resource allocation tend to be more important.\n\nIn 3GPP based technology (i.e, Cellular Communication Technology like LTE), the time domain scheduling is obvious and determinstic even when there are many devices are in communication because all of the time domain resources determined by the central master (Base Station /Node B/eNode B). However, in 802.11 based technology(i.e LAN, Wireless LAN etc) there is no central controling master in terms of scheduling. In this case, there is always possibility that transmission signal from one device interfere with communication of other devices. To prevent (or at least reduce) this situation, we need a special algorithm for Time Domain Scheduling. Time Domain Scheduling in this case mean 'Determine when to transmit and how long it transmit'.\n\nThen why we need to care of this kind of thing in LTE-Unlicensed technology ? Basically LTE Unlicensed technology (e.g, LTE-U, LAA etc) refer to a technology in which LTE operates in 802.11 frequency region. So LTE need to keep the rule set by 802.11 in order not to prevent the communiction between existing 802.11 devices.\n\nThere are many variations of the time domain scheduling, but the basic idea and logic is same. Basic idea is 'Your transmission should not interfere with communication between others' and the basic logic is 'Before you transmit anything, check if the chennel(medium) is already being used by others'. This logic can be illustrated as follows.\n\nThen you may have some questions as follows : How to check (i.e, how to figure out) whether the channel (medium) is being used by other ? and how long the device need to check before it make any decision ?\n\nIn the effort to answer these questions, you will come across many terms that may confuse you for so long. I tried to list up those confusing words and how these are related to each other in following illustration. If you are new to this area, I would suggest you to understand 'what is CS and ED ?' first and then try to understand how CS / ED is used in higher level technology like CSMA/CD, CSMA/CA, CCS, LBT, CSAT etc. Already feel headache ? :)\n\nCS / ED : CS stands for Carrier Sensing and ED stands for Energy Detection. The fundamental concept is same. The term CS is more frequently used in 802.11 area especially for Wired LAN Area. In this technology, the device measures the energy level in the channel (medium) mostly in the form of voltage and compares the measured voltage with a specified value (threshold value). ED stands for Energy Detection. it is more frequently used in wireless/cellular technology. In this method, the device measures the energy level in the channel (medium) mostly in the form of Power and compares the measured power with a specified value (threshold value)\n\nCSMA/CD or CSMA/CA : As the term CSMA(Carrier Sensing Multiple Access) implies, these are technology of figuring out whether a channel is available or not based on CS method. You don't need to know the details of thechnology under the context of LTE-Unlicensed technology, but if you are really interested in thses method refer to CSMA/CD and CSMA/CA page.\n\nCCA : CCA stands for Clear Channel Assessment. As the word implies, this is a method to figure out the channel is clear (i.e, nobody is using the channel). CCA perform ED(Energy Detection) for a certain period of time and make a decision whether the channel is clear or not. It is a common method being used in 802.11 (WLAN) technology.\n\nHow long CCA perform ED before it make decision ? It depends on higher layer technology (e.g, 802.11 FHSS, 802.11 OFDM, LBT). However, the minimum time span is 18 us sec.\n\nWhat is the threshold energy level to make decision whether the channel is being used by some other device or not ? This also varies depending on power class of the device and reciever antenna gain. However, the base threshold is -70 dBm.\n\nNOTE : Refer to 802.11 specification and ETSI EN 300 328 if you want to get full details and requirement for CCA.\n\nLBT: LBT stands for Listen Before Talk. According to ETSI EN 300 328, LBT is defined as 'mechanism by which an equipment applies clear channel assessment (CCA) before using the channel' (In this document, you can find a couple of variations of LBT depending on different situations). As you see in the terminology itself, 'Listen Before Talk' indicate two major process, the first one is 'Listen' and the second part is 'Talk'. The meaning of 'Talk' is obvious. It means 'Transmit Data'. The tricky part is 'what does it exactly mean by 'Listen''. In more technical definition, 'Listen' mean 'perform CCA(Clear Channel Assessment)'. You can find a more detailed description on LBT in IEEE P802.19-08/0034r0 (The specific value (i.e, transmission time, threshold value may vary depending on application, but I think this explains overal LBT mechanism in easier way than other documents).\n\nCSAT : CSAT stands for Carrier Sensing Adaptive Transmission. CSAT is very similar to CSMA or LBT(Listen Before Talk), the main difference is that CSAT monitors(senses) the medium for much longer duration (around tens of msec to 200 msec) comparing to normal WiFi CSMA, so that it would not interfere not only with WiFi\ndata transmission (QoS traffic) but also with more sporadic transmission like discovery signals (Ref [2]). Unlike other techiques described in this section (defined with focus on 802.11 technology), CSAT is defined by LTE-U Forum with focus on 3GPP technology.\n\nIn LTE, every transmission within a specified spectrum is well managed/scheduled both for downlink and uplink. So Network can figure out exactly when to transmit something and when UE will transmit something.. but in Unlicensed band transmission and reception by the existing WiFi device is not as predictable as in LTE. Basically anybody can transmit in anytime as long as it complies with\nCSMA/CA procedure.\n\nIn this kind of situation, how LTE network can schedule transmission in Unlicensed band ?\n\nOne method is for LTE cell to perform a special channel selection procedure and allocate the channel only when it is clean. \nIn channel selection process, network measures the energy level within the allowed band and use those area in which the energy level is under a certain threshold (e.g, -62 dBm over 20 Mhz BW).\n\nThe Cell performs this kind of channel selection algorithm in on-going mode and if needed it will select more suitable channel and switch to it.\n\nWhat if you (a Cell) fail to find any clean channel at the initial channel selection process ?\n\nIn this case, the cell use another mechanism called CSAT (Carrier-Sensing Adaptive Transmission). Technically, CSAT is very similar to CSMA or LBT(Listen Before Talk), the main difference is that CSAT monitors(senses) the medium for much longer duration (around tens of msec to 200 msec) comparing to normal WiFi CSMA, so that it would not interfere not only with WiFi\ndata transmission (QoS traffic) but also with more sporadic transmission like discovery signals (Ref [2]).\n\nAccording to Reference [5], there seems to be roughly three levels of Coexistence strategy regarding LTE-U. Most of these techniques are already mentioned in previous section, but let me rewrite in a little bit different words.\n\nChannel Selection : This says \"Use WiFi band only when it is not being used (i.e, the band is clean)\". To figure out whether it is being used or not, you have to measure the engergy level of the target band as described above.\n\nTime-domain coexistence techniques : Even when it fail to find any clean channel in channel selection stage, there is still some chance. Even though there is no clean channel at the point of channel selection, there might be some empty slots if you look at the time domain scheduling with relatively high granularity.\nTo find out this kind of time domain opportunity and in order not to make an interference at any time, they are considering several different technology like CSAT, eCSAT, LBT. My personal question were 'do we have to support all these technology everywhere (every devices)?'. This question was answered by Reference [5] as follows.\n\nFor non listen-before-talk (LBT) markets such as the US, South Korea, China and India, CSAT (Carrier Sensing Adaptive Transmission) can be used without changing Rel-10 Carrier Aggregation protocols for co-channel coexistence. For LBT markets such as Europe and Japan, Rel-13 LAA will enable channel sharing with Wi-Fi by performing clear channel assessment (CCA) based channel availability sensing and adapting the transmission duration on a fine timescale, ranging from 1ms-10ms\n\nOpportunistic SCell operation : To me, this sounds like a rule (not a technology). Basically this says \"Use the unlicensed band only when it is really necessary (e.g, in real demand on high throughput or when the primary cell is overloaded). Release the unlicensenced and fall back to anchor carrier when\nthe demand for unlicenced band is not critical.\n\nInterplay of these coexistance technical components are well illustrated as follows in Ref [2].\n\nLTE-U stands for LTE-Unlicensed. This is the first real implementation of the whole LTE-Unlicensed family as far as I remember. Since this is already implemented and tested relatively widely and a lot of details are known, I thought I got enough information to write this subject in a separate page. Refer to LTE-U page for the details.\n\nIn other LTE-Unlincensed technology, LTE borrow only radio spectrum from WLAN and all the transmission/reception technology except radio spectrum purely based on LTE. However, in LWA LTE borrows not only WLAN radio spectrum but also WLAN Access Point for transmitting data. This key difference is illustrated as below. To implement this key difference, we would need to implement many other\ntechnical components. The most important part would be to implmenet special interface between LTE eNB and WLAN AP. Then you may ask.. at which layer the eNB and WLAN will be connected ? It would be quicker to interact if they can get connected at lower layer (e.g, PHY/MAC), but LTE PHY/MAC and WLAN PHY/MAC is completely different.. so hard to make any connection at this layer. So they will use higher layer (specifically PDCP) for this connection. As you know, there is no PDCP layer in WLAN. So connecting at PDCP\nlayer might be a little bit misleading. More accruately speaking, LTE PDCP packet will be encapsulated into WLAN MAC frame.\n\nNow LWA is defined in 3GPP specification and I created a separate page for 3GPP LWA because it will be a long story. Refer to LWA page for the 3GPP details.\n\nAround the end of 2016, I start hearing of implementing this both on UE modem and Network, UE testing equipment side. Now (as of early 2017) I am hearing of testing this feature on real UE. So I decided to create separate page for this. Read LAA page for the details.\n\nPutting very simple way, Multipath Aggregation (more formally Multipath TCP Aggregation : mptcp) is LTE-WLAN aggregation at TCP level as illustrated below. The key component in this architecture would be MP Proxy (Multipath Proxy) and this part is being defined in IETF (Ref [12] )\n\nAs of now (Jan 2015), I don't have any specific information other than Integrated wireless railway network to be commercialized .\n\n[1] LTE-U/LAA, MuLTEfire and Wi-Fi; making best use of unlicensed spectrum (Qualcomm)\n\n[9] Cracking Google Project Fi & LTE/Wi-Fi Aggregation with Qualcomm - Wi-Fi Now Episode 5 (YouTube)\n\n[10] The LTE-U vs. Wi-Fi debate continues empowering carriers with seamless Wi-Fi - Wi-Fi Now Episode 15 (YouYube)\n\n[15] ETSI EN 300 328 Wideband transmission systems;Data transmission equipment operating in the 2,4 GHz ISM band and using wide band modulation techniques;",

This service component controls the transfer of the trace records from the NEFs to the OSF. The conceptual model is illustrated in figure 5, which employs both the event report function (CCITT X.734 [14]) and the log control function (CCITT X.735 [15]).\n\nThe trace control function collects traceable events within the NEF and formats them into trace records. These trace records may be stored locally within the NEF filestore or transferred to the OSF in the form of event reports. This is controlled by means of the \"priority\" indicator, which is a part of the trace type. If the \"priority\" indicator is not set then the trace records shall stored within the local filestore and subsequently transferred to the OSF in bulk via FTAM.\n\nIf a trace is activated with the \"priority\" indicator set then the trace records shall be sent to the OSF either direct by the trace control function or through Event Forwarding Discriminators (EFDs).\n\nIf EFDs are used then all trace records are offered to the EFDs. The EFDs determine which of the records are to be transmitted to the OSF in the form of event reports and the Operation System Id field in the header is ignored. The EDFs have complex filter constructs, which allow the operator to define the criteria for destinations and filters.\n\nIf EFDs are not used then all priority records are forwarded to the OSF whose address is given in the Operation System Id field. The NEF is required to supply additional information to provide the OS management application entity title.\n\nFinally, the trace records may also be stored in the form of log entries within the log of the NEF. It is up to the operator to decide if the log function is needed in parallel with the event reporting and file store. Once stored, the log records may be individually accessed by the OSF via the appropriate object management functions. Care should be taken of filter criteria for log records to avoid unnecessary overheads.\n\nThis service component contains the following groups of TMN management functions:\n\n9.2\tTransfer of Records\n\n9.2.1\tBulk record transfer\n\nThis group of TMN functions is concerned with the bulk transfer of trace records from the NEF record filestore to the OSF.\n\nThe trace records shall be transferred from the NEF to the OSF by the use of FTAM services. For further details of the use of FTAM see GSM 12.01 [8].\n\nIn addition to the simple file transfer services provided by FTAM, peertopeer application process communication may also be supported. The use of CMIS services for the uploading of files from the NEF to the OSF is specified in the GSM 12.00 [7].\n\nWhen the procedure defined in GSM 12.00 [7] and GSM 12.01 [8] are used to transfer the trace records, the file type shall be traceRecords and the format of the file is given by the type TraceFileFormat.\n\n9.2.2\tLog control\n\nThis function permits the trace record to be stored and retrieved from logs within the NEF. The logging of these records is performed in accordance with the log control function specified in CCITT X.735 [15] and no additional management functions are required.\n\n9.2.3\tLog access\n\nThis TMN function controls the access to the log described above. Each log defined may contain one or more log entries. Each log entry contains a single trace record.\n\nFor further details concerning the use of logs, see CCITT X.735 [15].\n\nThe following system management functions are required:\n\n9.2.4\tEvent Reporting\n\n9.2.4.1\tEvent Forwarding Discriminators\n\nFor shortterm recording of tracing events and for more complicated filter conditions the event forwarding discriminator construct defined in CCITT X.734 [14] and CCITT X.721 [13] can be employed. The event forwarding discriminator construct is extremely flexible permitting the combination of a number of fields and logical operations with a wide variety of scheduling options. The EFD also controls the destinations to which the event reports are sent. Several such filters may be defined and scheduled for operation at different times and for different time periods.\n\nThe following system management functions are required:\n\n9.2.4.2\tDirect Transfer by Trace Control Function\n\nThis function permits the NEF to transmit trace records direct to the OSF. In general the trace record shall be sent on completion of the call or the traceable event. This function is controlled by means of the \"priority\" indicator, which is contained in the trace type. If the priority indicator is not set, then the trace records shall be stored on file within the NE filestore. These records may be subsequently collected via bulk record transfer as described in subclause 9.2.1. If the trace type specified on activation includes the \"priority\" indicator then all of the records shall be sent via trace reports to the OSF specified by the operation system id.\n\nThe following system management functions are required:",

The process of directed retry involves the assignment of a UE/MS to a radio channel on a cell other than the serving cell. This process is triggered by the assignment procedures, as described in 3GPP TS 48.008, and employs internal or external GSM to UMTS handover procedures as described in subclauses 6.2.2 and 8.2. The successful procedure for a directed retry in case of an intra-3G_MSC GSM to UMTS handover is as shown in figure 40a and as described below.\nIf during the assignment phase, as represented by the A-ASSIGNMENT-REQUEST message, a GSM to UMTS handover becomes necessary, due to radio conditions, congestion or inability to provide the requested bearer service in GSM, then the UE/MS may be handed over to a UMTS cell. If the requested bearer service cannot be provided in GSM, 3G_MSC-A shall indicate in the A-ASSIGNMENT-REQUEST message that handover to UMTS should be performed. When the decision has been made to handover the UE/MS the BSS-A may send an A-ASSIGNMENT-FAILURE message, indicating 'directed retry', before sending the A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message to 3G_MSCA, indicating 'directed retry'. However BSS-A may alternatively send the A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message, indicating 'directed retry', without sending the A-ASSIGNMENT-FAILURE message. Other cause values may be used instead of \"Directed Retry\" in the A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message, this will allow the 3G_MSC to take different actions dependent on the received cause. Upon receipt of the A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message from BSS-A, then 3G_MSCA shall initiate the GSM to UMTS handover as described in subclauses 6.2.2 and 8.2. No resources shall be cleared in the 3G_MSCA or BSS-A for this connection.\n\nAfter receipt of the Iu-RELOCATION-COMPLETE message from RNS-B the assignment procedure shall be considered to be complete and the resources on BSS-A shall be cleared.\nIf a failure occurs during the handover attempt, for example A-HANDOVER-FAILURE returned from BSS-A or Iu-RELOCATION FAILURE from RNS-B then 3G_MSCA will terminate the GSM to UMTS handover to RNS-B. Under these conditions 3G_MSCA may optionally take one of a number of actions:\nThe procedures for Inter-3G_MSC GSM to UMTS handover are also applicable to the directed retry process.

When switched on, the model modifies the AoAs of the paths arriving at the subscriber unit.  It is for use in both the urban macro and urban micro scenarios.\n\nUrban-canyons exist in dense urban areas served by macro-cells, and for at-rooftop micro-cells.  When this model is used, the spatial channel for all subscribers in the simulated universe will be defined by the statistical model given below.  Thus for the SCM channel generation steps given in Clause 5.3, Step 9 is replaced with steps 9a-d given below, which describe the AoAs of the paths arriving at the subscriber in the urban canyon scenario.\n\nThe following procedure is used to determine the subscriber mean AoAs of the six paths.  This model does not use a building grid, but assigns angles based on statistical data presented in the figures below.  The procedure is defined in terms of the subscriber terminal:\n\nStep 9a. Select a random street orientation from: U(0, 360˚) which also equals the direction of travel for the UE.\n\nStep 9b. Select a random orientation for the subscriber antenna array from U(0, 360).\n\nStep 9c. Given  the predefined fraction of UEs to experience the urban canyon effect, Select a uniform random draw for the parameter .\n\nStep 9d. If   select the UE AoAs for all arriving paths to be equal, with 50% probability of being from the direction of the street orientation obtained in step 9a, and 50% the street orientation plus an offset of 180.  If  select the directions of arrival for all paths using the standard SCM UE AoA model given in Clause 5.3, step 9.\n\nIn Figure 5.3, the urban canyon procedure is simulated to show the effects of the model on the composite UE angle spread.  The parameter , which describes the percentage of mobiles that will experience the urban canyon effects.  The figure illustrates the result of selecting the AoAs, where each of the paths has a fixed 35˚ angle spread.\n\nThe parameter , is set to a relatively high percentage of occurrence to emphasize the urban canyon effects, while the remaining occurrences assume some mixed arrivals to model various other conditions such as cross streets or where signals arrive from between buildings or from unknown paths at various angles.",

Single Cell Point To Multiploint (SC-PTM) uses the eMBMS system architecture, providing enhancements in the air interface to improve radio efficiency and to reduce latency. SC-PTM supports broadcast/multicast services over single cell, and the broadcast/multicast area can be dynamically adjusted cell by cell according to user's distribution.\n\nSC-PTM transfers the broadcast/multicast services using LTE downlink shared channel (i.e. PDSCH), and it is scheduled using a common RNTI (i.e. Group-RNTI) for a group of users. The SC-PTM scheduling is quite agile and radio resources could be dynamically assigned in time and frequency domain by PDCCH based on real time traffic load TTI by TTI.\n\nSC-PTM is especially suitable for scenarios where broadcast/ multicast service is expected to be delivered to a limited number of cells due to user interests and the concerned cells may dynamically change due to user movement. SC-PTM allows efficient radio utilisation and flexible deployment of number of applications, e.g. critical communications, traffic information for cars and on-demand TV services, etc.\n\nLTE Broadcast Test Specifications demonstrate Device Conformity - 3GPP news article July 2015",

The downlink DPCH can thus be seen as a time multiplex of a downlink DPDCH and a downlink DPCCH, compare subclause 5.2.1.\n\nFigure 9 shows the frame structure of the downlink DPCH. Each frame of length 10 ms is split into 15 slots, each of length Tslot = 2560 chips, corresponding to one power-control period.\n\nThe parameter k in figure 9 determines the total number of bits per downlink DPCH slot. It is related to the spreading factor SF of the physical channel as SF = 512/2k. The spreading factor may thus range from 512 down to 4.\n\nThe exact number of bits of the different downlink DPCH fields (Npilot, NTPC, NTFCI, Ndata1 and Ndata2) is given in table 11. What slot format to use is configured by higher layers and can also be reconfigured by higher layers.\n\nThere are basically two types of downlink Dedicated Physical Channels; those that include TFCI (e.g. for several simultaneous services) and those that do not include TFCI (e.g. for fixed-rate services). These types are reflected by the duplicated rows of table 11. It is the UTRAN that determines if a TFCI should be transmitted and it is mandatory for all UEs to support the use of TFCI in the downlink. The mapping of TFCI bits onto slots is described in [3].\n\nIn compressed frames, a different slot format is used compared to normal mode. There are two possible compressed slot formats that are labelled A and B. Slot format B shall be used in frames compressed by spreading factor reduction and slot format A shall be used in frames compressed by higher layer scheduling. The channel bit and symbol rates given in table 11 are the rates immediately before spreading.\n\nThe pilot bit patterns are described in table 12. The shadowed column part of pilot bit pattern is defined as FSW and FSWs can be used to confirm frame synchronization. (The value of the pilot bit pattern other than FSWs shall be \"11\".) In table 12, the transmission order is from left to right.\n\nIn downlink compressed mode through spreading factor reduction, the number of bits in the TPC and Pilot fields are doubled. Symbol repetition is used to fill up the fields. Denote the bits in one of these fields in normal mode by x1, x2, x3, …, xX. In compressed mode the following bit sequence is sent in corresponding field: x1, x2, x1, x2, x3, x4, x3, x4,…, xX,.\n\nThe relationship between the TPC symbol and the transmitter power control command is presented in table 13.\n\nMulticode transmission may be employed in the downlink, i.e. the CCTrCH (see [3]) is mapped onto several parallel downlink DPCHs using the same spreading factor. In this case, the Layer 1 control information is transmitted only on the first downlink DPCH. DTX bits are transmitted during the corresponding time period for the additional downlink DPCHs, see figure 10.\n\nIn case there are several CCTrCHs mapped to different DPCHs transmitted to the same UE different spreading factors can be used on DPCHs to which different CCTrCHs are mapped. Also in this case, Layer 1 control information is only transmitted on the first DPCH while DTX bits are transmitted during the corresponding time period for the additional DPCHs.",

The information offered here is as by way of a supplement to the formal 3GPP drafting rules given in TR 21.801, which you are fervently recommended to read as well.\n\nContents[Hide]How to startCover page logo(s)Stock textStructure of your SpecReferencesBibliographyClauses 2.3 Information transfer2.3.1 Call establishment messages2.3.2 Information exchange messages2.4 Some new topic2.3 Information transfer2.3.0 Introduction2.3.1 Call establishment messages2.3.2 Information exchange messages2.4 Some new topicAnnexesChange historyFigures, tables, notes, examples, equationsAutomatic numberingBullet pointsLanguage and linguistic styleLanguage-ise or -ize ?Omitted articlesGerman punctuationCurly quotes (Smart quotes)Style and idiomDefined terms and abbreviationsNormative and informative textLinguistic conventions - verbsActive or passiveLayoutUse of tradenames, registered trademarks, etc. in SpecsTable of contents and history tableASN.1 in Technical SpecificationsPresentation of draft to TSG for informationPresentation of draft to TSG for approvalCombined information and approvalSpec brought under change controlAnd finally ... \nCongratulations, you have volunteered (or have been volunteered) to be rapporteur for a new TS or TR. We will refer to TSs and TRs collectively as \"Specs\", except where there is an important distinction to be made.\n\nWhy are you called \"rapporteur\" rather than \"editor\"? The word \"rapporteur\" has been used for a long time in international standardization circles, particularly the ITU. It is a French word meaning literally \"reporter\", and therein lies the clue: you are required not only to draft the Spec, but also to act as a centre of technical knowledge on it, to whom other 3GPP delegates can pose technical questions and propose modifications. You must also be prepared to respond to questions from the wider community including those uninvolved with 3GPP. And depending on the habits of your working group and TSG, you may also be required to provide regular written status updates on the progress of the draft.\n\nOnce a rapporteur, always a rapporteur. You will remain designated as the rapporteur for your Spec for ever and a day unless you tell MCC (for example, your group's Secretary) that you are no longer able to continue in the role because, for example, you are changing roles within your empoyer, or changing company and the new employer will not support you, or you are retiring, taking monastic orders, intending to die, etc. If you are unable to continue as rapporteur, in the first instance ask your employer if there is anybody willing to take over the role from you. Failing that, let your group's Chairman know, and he will actively seek a replacement from amongst the active delegates. He can be expected to do this with enthusiasm, because the default, if he cannot find a new rapporteur, is that he has to take on the role himself!\n\nMake sure MCC knows of any change in your contact coordinates (email, telephone, etc) - particularly, of couse, if you change company.\n\nIf you change to a company which is not a 3GPP Individual Member, you must relinquish your rapporteurship and may not attend any further 3GPP meetings.\n\nSo, start by downloading the stock TS or TR skeleton document from the 3GPP file server and saving it on your PC. You can download it using either FTP or HTTP.\n\n(There is a reason for retaining the .doc format: the .docx format does not support certain features of the .doc format, in particular the Equation Editor, which is very widely used in 3GPP Specs, especially those from TSG RAN. We intend to retain the .doc format for Specs for the foreseeable future. For practical hints on editing documents containing old-style equations, follow this link.)\n\nYou are not constrained to use Microsoft Word to edit your Spec: you can use any word processor which can handle the .doc(x) format (both reading and saving).\n\nThe skeleton Spec file contains all you need to get started, plus quite a lot which you probably won't need in your final spec, but you can delete that later on. There is also quite a lot of guidance text, rendered in blue. DO read the guidance text and follow its instructions. When you have done what a particular element of guidance has proposed, you should delete the corresponding blue text.\n\nYou will see that the skeleton Spec provides you with several options for which logos to retain on the cover page. Follow the blue guidance text to decide which lines to delete.\n\nYou will see that the skeleton Spec already includes a certain amount of stock text in, for example, the Foreword, and in clauses 2 and 3. DO NOT modify this stock text in any way.\n\nDO NOT change the structure of the early part of the Spec skeleton, though the unnumbered Introduction clause is optional and if you think there is no need for an introduction, you can delete it. Clauses 1 (Scope), 2 (References), and 3 (Definitions) must remain - though you might wish to delete the \"symbols\" subclause 3.2 if you have none, in which case you should renumber the \"abbreviations\" subclause to avoid leaving a gap.\n\nThis brings us to another apparently minor, though actually important point: 3GPP Specs are divided into clauses, and NOT into sections or chapters. This terminology is important when you are referencing particular places in a Spec, be those places in the same Spec or in other Specs.\n\nClause 4 of the skeleton Spec contains some useful guidance about the use of the various built-in paragraph and character styles. DO read this text - before you delete it. Ultimately, the main body of your new Spec will start at clause 4.\n\nClauses 4 onwards are up to you. Use them to provide the main contents of the Spec.\n\nDO list every document which is mentioned in the body of your Spec in clause 2 \"References\". Follow the format of the examples shown in the skeleton document. Any external document can be referenced except:\n\nThe * asterisked * conditions are waived if your Spec is itself a 3GPP-internal TR.\n\nIt is strongly recommended that references to any non-3GPP document - for example, an ITU Recommendation or an Internet Draft - be to a specific version (i.e. identified by a particular edition or version, or by publication date). Some TSGs insist on this condition.\n\nIf you reference a 3GPP Spec which is not included or intended to be included in the same Release as that of your Spec, you must ensure that the reference indicates the Release in which the document can be found.\n\nDO reference a particular 3GPP Spec (or ITU Recommendation, etc.) DO NOT make a generic reference to an entire series of Specs (or Recommendations, etc). Thus reference, say,\n32.401\n32.402\n32.403\nas three separate references, rather than a singe reference to\n32.40x series.\n\nOne of the duties of a rapporteur is to regularly monitor the state of all external documents referenced from his Spec. If any ceases to be available - for example, is withdrawn by its publisher, or goes permanently out of print, or vanishes from a web site - then the reference must be removed or deleted from your Spec by means of a CR. If the reference gave normative provisions essential to the implementation of your Spec, considerable rework might be required.\n\nDO reference other documents; DO NOT copy text from those documents and include it in your Spec. As sure as eggs is eggs, the other document will one day be revised, and the extract which you have copied into your Spec will no longer accord with that revised document.\n\nThe only justifiable exception to the do-not-copy rule is where it is known that the external document is not publicly available (according to the definition above). In this case, it is permissible to copy short exerpts into your Spec - although the text may need editorial revision to ensure it abides by the formal drafting rules, and thus not be a verbatim copy. If it is unavoidable to copy lengthy passages or indeed entire documents, then the best approach to this is to include the original document within the zip file of your spec, and to create an annex in your Spec which explicitly \"references\" that external document by filename, and indicates that the file can be found within this Spec's zip file. When doing such copying and where the source material is not a 3GPP document, always ensure that no violation of copyright conditions are entailed. If in any doubt, consult your MCC Project Manager, who will investigate and if necessary obtain permission to reproduce the text (or figures, etc). Be aware that this might result in a delay in finalization of your Spec, and in the worst case, permission to reproduce may not be forthcoming, in which case your Spec will have to be redrafted to avoid the copied part.\n\nBy convention, once a Spec is under change control, modifying existing reference numbers by inserting or deleting of references is strongly deprecated.\n\nHence always add a new reference at the end of the existing list, and if a reference becomes obsolete, leave it in the list, but delete the text and replace it with \"void\": so that, for example\n\n...\n[3] 3GPP TS 32.102: \"3G Telecom Management architecture\".\n[4] 3GPP TS 32.106: \"3G Performance Management\".\n[5] ITU-T Recommendation X.710: \"Common management information service definition for CCITT applications\".\n[6] ITU-T Recommendation X.711: \"Common management information protocol specification for CCITT applications\".\n...\n\n[3] 3GPP TS 32.102: \"3G Telecom Management architecture\".\n[4] 3GPP TS 32.106: \"3G Performance Management\".\n[5] (void)\n[6] ITU-T Recommendation X.711: \"Common management information protocol specification for CCITT applications\".\n\nIt may be desirable to provide a list of further reading material, particularly in a TR. DO NOT include this in the References clause, but rather, DO create a Bibliography (informative) annex and list the material there, using the same layout conventions as in the References clause, except that the list will be unnumbered.\n\nAs you will have gathered, level 1 clauses are numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, etc, and are to be rendered in style Heading 1. There is no limit to how many clauses your Spec may have, but avoid both excessively long clauses and too fine a granularity.\n\nMany if not most clauses will have subclauses, and those subclauses may well have further subclauses. Bigger fleas have smaller fleas upon their backs to bite 'em. And smaller fleas have lesser fleas, and so ad infinitum. Level two clauses must be rendered in style Heading 2, level 3 in Heading 3, and so on. You can subdivide a clause down to six levels. (Notice that only the higher levels are listed in the table of contents, which would otherwise become too unwieldy.) If absolutely necessary, you can go beyond six levels, but for all clause title lines from six onwards, use style H6 (not Heading 6).\n\nFor clause numbers, retain the arabic numeral system for all levels. Do not insert a full-stop at the end of the clause number, and separate the clause number from its title by exactly one tab character.\n\nAvoid \"hanging paragraphs\" - that is, the paragraphs rendered in red in the hypothetical example below:\n\nVarious message types may be used to transfer information across the interface. The type used depends on the context of the transfer.\n\nMessage sets shall be consistent, with no message types shared amongst two or more sets.\n\nThese messages shall be exchanged between entities to establish a call blah blah blah.\n\nThese messages shall be exchanged between entities to exchange information between those entities in a circular and auto-tautological manner blah blah blah.\n\nReference to the hanging paragraphs is ambiguous: if a reference cites clause 2.3 of the above document, does it mean just the two red paragraphs, or does it mean everything below the header for clause 2.3 and above the header for clause 2.4? Thus the following structure should be used, since it is completely unambigous, since reference to clause 2.3 obviously includes all its subclauses, since its entire content consists of subclauses.\n\nVarious message types may be used to transfer information across the interface. The type used depends on the context of the transfer.\nMessage sets shall be consistent, with no message types shared amongst two or more sets.\n\nThese messages shall be exchanged between entities to establish a call blah blah blah.\n\nThese messages shall be exchanged between entities to exchange information between those entities in a circular and auto-tautological manner blah blah blah.\n\nThe main body of your Spec will be followed by at least one annex. Annexes are labelled A, B, C, etc. If you want more than 26 annexes, label the next ones AA, AB, AC, etc.\n\nUse annexes to contain supplementary information or details which if included in the main body would make the Spec too turgid to understand on first reading. Every annex except the change history (see below) MUST be referred to from somewhere within the main body of the Spec. Such references set the context of the annexes, which would otherwise be floating out of orbit, like uncharted asteroids.\n\nEvery annex of a TS must be clearly labeled as being either \"normative\" or \"informative\". Try to avoid placing informative text in a normative annex, other than where it is necessary to explain or exemplify a passage of normative content. Under no circumstances put any normative text in an informative annex.\n\n3GPP TRs which are intended to be \"published\" by the participating 3GPP Standards Development Organizations can contain no normative text - they are purely informative - so in a TR the template omits the \"normative\" and \"informative\" tag on annexes. Note that TSs and TRs use different styles for their annex title lines in order that both are rendered elegantly in the table of contents. Annex title lines in TSs must be in style Heading 8, whilst those in TRs must be in Heading 9. However, TRs which are designated as internal to 3GPP are often used as temporary placeholders for provisions which will ultimately find themselves moved into normative clauses of TSs; for this reason, the no-normative-text-in-TRs rule is relaxed for internal TRs. Nevertheless, the intended use should be made clear in the Scope clause of the TR.\n\nNote that clause numbers in annexes are to be styled as Heading 1 for A.1, A.2, A.3, etc; Heading 2 for A.1.1, A.1.2, A.1.3, etc; Heading 3 for A.1.1.1, A.1.1.2, A.1.1.3, etc and so on. That is, the annex letter and the dot following it do not count towards the heading level.\n\nThe last annex of your Spec must be entitled \"Change history\" and must be updated each time you release a new numbered version of the Spec.\n\nDuring the drafting of a Spec, the text may go through a large number of iterations in the course of a single meeting or even between one meeting and the next. It might be impractical to update the version number for each and every iteration, and in this case, you must avoid the confusion which could arise where several instances of a Spec might be found, all bearing the same version number, by one or other of the following expedients:\n\nIt is usual to issue a formal new version at or shortly after the end of a working group meeting, when you, the rapporteur, have incorporated all the text changes in all the draft CRs or text proposals agreed during the meeting. When issuing a new version, indicate the date that this version was created (and not the date it was presented to the WG or the date it was distributed by email, etc.).\n\nYour Spec will probably need to include at least some of these elements - a picture is worth a thousand words - and a common approach is needed throughout your Spec.\n\nEach figure and table must be numbered, with a separate number series used for each. Two approaches to numbering are in common use:\n\nYou may choose the approach you prefer, but do adopt the same approach for numbering both figures and tables, do not mix the two systems.\n\nFigures have their number and title below the figure; the figure must be in style TH and the caption line containing the number and title in style TF. Tables have their caption lines above the table, in style TH. The text in the body of tables must use styles TAH (heading rows), TAL / TAC / TAR for left-justified / centered / right-justified text for normal rows, and TAN for notes within the frame of the table.\n\nNotes and examples need not be numbered unless there are more than one note or example in a given (sub)clause, in which case those notes should be numbered 1, 2, 3, ... and the series restarted whenever a new clause number is encountered.\n\nFor equations, either of the above numbering mechanisms may be used, but it will generally be found useful to number them so that they may be easily referred to from elsewhere in the Spec, or indeed from external Specs. The equation editor of early versions of Word is not compatible with later versions. To edit a TS or TR containing an equation (e.g. for the purpose of creating a Change Request to it) using MS Word version 2007 or later, it is advisable to convert the file to .docx format, perform the necessary edits, and save the modified file back in .doc format.\n\nA note, introduced with the word \"Note\" and rendered in the special paragraph style \"NO\" is a formal construct. DO NOT write normative text in a note: in-line notes are always purely informative. However, notes which are in the frame of a figure (normally below the graphic, but always above the caption line) or of a table may contain normative provisions. Such notes must have an explicit reference from somewhere within the figure or table to place them in context.\n\nEditor's notes (which have a dedicated paragraph style) can be used as reminders of things to be added in the Spec at a later date. There are no rules about numbering editor's notes. In principle, when the Spec is 100% conplete, no editor's notes should remain.\n\nDuring drafting, it is likely that clauses and subclauses will need to be added, deleted, or moved from place to place. You might find it useful to use automatic clause numbering to maintain a sequential series of clause numbers. Similarly for figures, tables, notes, etc, Word provides the {seq} field code to make numbering and cross referencing easier and less error-prone. If you do use automatic numbering - and even more so if you don't - keep the numbering logical, consistent, and sequential throughout the Spec.\n\nAt the moment when the Spec is approved by the TSG to come under change control, your MCC Project Manager will freeze the clause numbering, and thereafter it must be maintained manually, thus ensuring that existing clause (and figure, table, ...) numbers remain unchanged from version to version and from Relase to Release. Keeping those numbers constant ensures that references to particular clauses (etc) from other Specs will remain correct even as new clauses etc are added to your Spec.\n\nUse bullet points to present lists. A list is much easier to read and digest than a block of continuous text with items separated by commas. An itemized list should use as bullet characters a dash (hyphen), though where there are sub-items, a different character can be used to make the heirarchical level of the item clear. Use numbered items if you need to refer to individual items of the list from elsewhere in the text. The discussion on automatic numbering above applies equally to numbered list items.\n\nFollow the bullet or number character with a tab to ensure correct alignment of the paragraph.\n\nDO use the appropriate paragraph style: B1 for top level, B2 for second level, etc. These styles will automatically indent items from the left margin an appropriate distance according to their level. DO NOT use Normal style then manually indent.\n\n3GPP Specs are to be written in English. All 3GPP business is conducted in English, so anybody offering themselves as a rapporteur will obviously have at least a fair command of the language.\n\nBut which English? Most rapporteurs will be familiar with either British English or American English, and these are the varieties you should aim to use.\n\nThe guidance for a rapporteur is: choose one or the other, and stick to it throughout the entire Spec. This means you may have to adjust text proposals coming from delegates who speak the \"other\" English before you incorporate them into your document. It is important that a Spec reads as a uniform document, and not as a collection of contributions having different spellings and linguistic styles.\n\nFor further ventilation on the style and vagaries of English, see the ETSI Guide to the use of English.\n\nA frequent cause of disagreement is the spelling of \"-ize\" words, such as \"standardize\". The suffix \"-ize\" is used to form verbs meaning \"bring into some state\" specified by the noun or adjective of the stem. Thus \"standardize\" means to bring into a standard state.\n\nMany of the native languages - Finnish, Russian and other Slavic languages, Japanese, Mandarin Chinese, ... - spoken by rapporteurs do not have one or other of the definite article \"the\" or the indefinite article \"a\" (\"an\" before a vowel sound), and these writers may have to rely on their colleagues who are more used to using articles to advise them as to where, in English, they are necessary and when they are not. Even rapporteurs whose native language does have these articles may find that their usage differs in English.\n\nActually, this clause relates to all punctuation other than non-standard English punctuation (of which there are at least two schools of thought anyway). The basic advise is to keep sentences short enough that little or no punctuation (other than the terminal full-stop / period) is needed. Germans in particular tend to write sentences with very long subjects, and to separate the subject from its verb with a comma. This is probably a reflection of the need to breath at that point in the sentence, but has the effect of breaking the thought train so that a native English speaker (at least) will probably have to go back to the beginning of the sentence and re-read it mentally omitting that comma.\n\nExample: Terminal equipment in the powered up but idle state which receives the auto-wake-up command and which is capable of providing visual feedback to the user, shall inform the user of the event.\n\nDisable this feature of your word processor. 3GPP Specs must use \"straight\" quotes, not the \"comma-shaped\" characters to which most installations of Word default.\n\nUse double quotation marks, not single, since single quotation marks can be confused for appostrophes. However, if it is unavoidable to nest quotations within quotations, use double marks for the outer ones, and single marks for the inner ones.\n\nBearing in mind your international readership, you should keep the style of the language of your Spec as simple as possible, compatible with being clear and unambiguous. Native English speakers, in particular, should take care not to use colloquial words or phrases, or regional idioms. Restrict your vocabulary insofar as possible to words which are likely to be readily understood by the vast majority of your readership.\n\nIf your Spec will make repeated use of a term or an abbreviation, make sure it is defined. The definition must appear in one of:\n\nIf you are inventing a new term, first ask yourself whether that term or something very similar is already in use elsewhere in 3GPP. If so, try to re-use that existing term. If not, by all means create a new term, but try to make it sufficiently different from any existing term so as to minimize the possibility of confusion between them.\n\nIf your new term is likely to used beyond the bounds of your own Spec, consider making it generally available by inserting it in TR 21.905. It will then automatically be available for use within your Spec.\n\nIt may seem like a convenience to the reader of your Spec to copy the definition of a term from some other document so it is readily to hand rather than making the reader go off to the other document to search for it; but convenience for the reader is in this case secondary to rigorously correct terminology. Avoid duplicating a definition which is already to be found in TR 21.905 or in some other 3GPP Spec. If any element of a Spec is replicated, it is certain that, with the passage time, those replicas will mutate and 3GPP will end up with multiple definitions of the same term. This is obviously undesirable.\n\nIf you find that you cannot avoid re-using an existing term but cannot avoid giving it a slightly different meaning in your Spec to that which it has elsewhere, then the definition you include in clause 3 of your Spec will override all other definitions of that term. It might be worth adding in a note below the formal definition that this differs from the same term defined in other Specs.\n\nYou should use a defined term to express the same concept each time you use it. You are not writing a gothic novel or a bed-time story. You are writing a technical specification or report. Thus once you have a term with a particular meaning, continue to use that term - and no other - each time you want to express that concept. If the term is lengthy or complex, you may want to use it in abbreviated form; the same considerations apply to abbreviations as apply to terms. This practice may make your Spec less readable, but it will more more rigorously technically precise, and faulty logic or ambiguities will be more easily detected.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing section on Language, you should realize that 3GPP TSs (and to a lesser extent, TRs) are not written in everyday English, but have to observe some conventions of language which are laid down in the formal drafting rules. Provisions of a Spec (that is to say, passages of text, including figures and tables) are divided into \"normative\" and \"informative\" types.\n\nNormative content lays down the requirements of a TS: things which have to be complied with, or it is recommended to comply with, or are possible to comply with.\n\nInformative content gives information or possibly guidance to implementors, but with which it is not necessary (or possible) for equipment to comply with.\n\n3GPP Specs are not written in \"ordinary\" English, but in a special \"standardese\" where certain conventions over auxiliary verbs apply. These conventions can be confusing for some non-native English speakers, whose own languages may have no equivalent to these words.\n\nRecommendations, use \"should\": \"If there is supplementary information to convey, the equipment should send an information message.\"\n\nPermissions, use \"may\": \"The equipment may send an information message if it wishes to convey status information to the remote equipment.\"\n\nDescribing events which are outside the scope of the Spec, but which need to be taken into consideration, use \"will\": \"The remote equipment will respond with an acknowledge message.\"\n\nNote that in the \"recommendation\" above, the recommendation was qualified with a condition: \"if xxx then yyy\". If at all possible, \"should\" is to be avoided, because, despite being a recommendation, it leaves the choice entirely to the implementer. Far better to specify a rigorous option with a mandatory action, as in \"If there is supplementary information to convey, the equipment shall send an information message.\"\n\nThe use of \"may\" is even woolier, since there is not even a recommendation as to which action is more desirable, to do or not to do. Again, avoid \"may\" if at all possible. Note that the negative of \"may\" is \"need not\", since \"may not\" is ambiguous.\n\nDespite very many examples of the contrary, it is usually better to express provisions in the active voice rather than the passive voice, since the former explicitly states who or what is to carry out the action, whereas the latter can leave this unstated and therefore vague.\n\nThus prefer\n\"The user equipment shall confirm the receipt of the notification by returning an acknowlege message.\"\nto\n\"On receipt of the notification, an acknowledge message shall be returned.\"\nIn the second example, it is not clear whether the duty of returning the acknowledge message is on the user equipment or on some other entity such as the distant end gateway.\n\nUse the paragraph and font styles included in the template. It is seldom necessary - and always undesirable - to add new styles, and absolutely forbidden to modify existing styles\n\nYou may use italic and bold font for emphasis, but NOT underlining, because this can be confused with revision marking. For the same reason, avoid coloured font. If it is absolutely necessary to use coloured font, DO supply a key so that the reader knows the significance of each colour. But ideally, stick to automatic font colour (normally black).\n\nDO NOT add blank paragraphs or manual page breaks to introduce vertial white space. This is never necessary. If your document throws a page break in an undesirable place, use Word's paragraph properties to, for example, keep all lines of a paragraph together, to enable widow/orphan control, to keep-with-next. In this way, you let Word insert page breaks where necessary, and prevent it from inserting them where undesirable.\n\nDO NOT add vertical white space (leading) using blank paragraphs, except to ensure a clause title line does not immediately follow after a table (where layout can go wrong if this is not done). DO rely on the built-in paragraph styles to govern vertical spacing.\n\nIn a word - don't. If at all possible, avoid using registered names or marks in your Spec, and use generic terms instead. If being specific is unavoidable, research the ownership of the tradename or mark, and acknowledge that organization's marks at the start of the Spec, at the foot of page 2.\n\nEach time you edit the draft Spec, remember to refresh the table of contents, and to update the history box at the end of the document to show the meeting at or shortly after which you edited it, the tdoc number (if any) of the new version, the changes wrought (for example by listing the tdocs bringing agreed text proposals to the Spec), and the new version number.\n\nBe aware that the page numbers in the table of contents will vary as a function of the paper size (e.g. A4 or Letter) and margin settings on your default or chosen printer. Therefore, do not rely on the page number shown in the table of contents, but rather on the clause number. Never use page numbers in references, either within a Spec or to external 3GPP Specs.\n\nMany TSs include data structure descriptions in ASN.1. If you are proposing to add formal ASN.1 to a Spec (i.e. contributing a pCR or CR tdoc) and you need to define new Object Identifiers, then follow the instructions on how to allocate OI node values which you can find on the ASN.1 page.\n\nMore information on this, and the following, procedural aspects can be found in the 3GPP TSG Working Procedures, TR 21.900.\n\nWhen the working group is agreed that a draft Spec is mature enough - subjectively at least 60% complete - it must be sent to the next TSG meeting for information. This simply gives the document wider visibility, and allows feedback from a wider circle of competence than just the working group delegates.\n\nThe decision that a Spec is ready to be sent for information will be recorded in the meeting report. Send the working-group-agreed text to your MCC Project Manager. The version number will at this point be 0.<something>.<something> (unless it has already been seen by the TSG and is going round the loop again). The Project Manager will now run a final critical eye over your Spec and make any necessary minor improvements which may be necessary to ensure alignment with the 3GPP Drafting Rules (and the guidance on this page).\n\nIt sometimes happens that the actual Spec is not available by the end of the meeting, and the rapporteur needs a few days to incorporate all the finally agreed text. Remember that your MCC Project Manager will need additional time to do his final check on the document, and that he may have several Specs to handle in the same time scale. When he has finished his check, he will raise the Spec to version 1.0.0 and send it back to you, the rapporteur.\n\nWhen presented to the TSG, the Spec must be accompanied by a special cover sheet which indicates the progress made since the previous presentation to the TSG (obviously this part will be left blank the first time it is presented). It is your responsibility to fill in the cover sheet, and to obtain a TSG tdoc number, and to prepare the tdoc containing your cover sheet plus the MCC-adjusted version of the Spec itself.\n\nIt is normally only necessary to present a draft Spec to the TSG for information once. Drafting then resumes in the Working Group. DO make sure you use the version seen by the TSG (normally 1.0.0) as the starting point for further modifications, NOT the version you yourself last edited.\n\nWhen the working group is agreed that a draft Spec is mature enough - subjectively at least 80% complete - it must be sent to the next TSG meeting for approval.\n\nThe steps involved are similar to those above for presenting for information, except that this time, MCC will raise the WG-agreed document to version 2.0.0. The same cover sheet is used in the TSG tdoc, but obviously containing updated information. Pay particular attention to describe in some detail the remaining points of contention or incomplete elements. This text may be used to influence the decision as to whether the work is complete or not (i.e. the percentage completion of the work item concerned).\n\nIf the TSG approves the draft Spec, then it will be brought under change control - see below.\n\nIf, however, the TSG does not consider the Spec to be ripe enough for approval, it may ask the WG to continue to develop it, and this presentation for approval step will have to be repeated, with the rapporteur producing versions 2.y.z until it is again considered to be ready for approval. Again, the MCC Project Manager must give it a final once-over for conformity to the rules.\n\nIdeally, when a Spec is brought for approval, there should be no, or at least very few, remaining \"editor's notes\" and \"for further study\" elements.\n\nAlthough in contradiction of the formal working procedures (TR 21.900), in cases of urgency, a working group may decide to bring a mature Spec for information and for approval at a single TSG meeting, in effect combining the above proceeses. In this case, the Spec will be raised to version 1.0.0 (not 2.0.0), and the TSG may (or may not) immediately approve it to come under change control.\n\nOnce a Spec has been approved by the TSG to be brought under change control, the MCC Project Manager will raise it to version x.0.0 where x represents the Release in question. From this point onwards, you, the rapporteur, have no right to edit the Spec. All changes must be done via formal change requests. However, you still have an important role to play in, for example,\n\nNevertheless, the bulk of your creative work has reached a successful conclusion so ... congratulations!\n\nYou may be interested to read ETSI's A Guide to Writing World Class Standards published (2020 version supersedes 2014), a guide to rapporteurs and contributors to standardization.\n\nPage last reviewed / updated ...\nLink to 2020 version of A Guide to Wirting World Class Standards, replacing 2014 version [2020-08-28]\nto indicate actions if a Spec's rapporteur can no longer continue in the role; to update guidance text on the use of .doc and .docx file formats [2019-01-05]\nto add a hint on how to edit Specs containing equations [2014-09-24]\nto \"hide\" supplementary informative text in rollover pop-up boxes [2014-05-06]\nto incorporate remarks from F Firmin and M Pope [2014-03-20]\nclarification on hanging paragraps and clause styles in annexes [2015-01-06]\nto correct a spelling mistake [2016-08-05]\nadding explanatory info tip on how to copy figures from one document to another [2018-03-07]\nto add instructions relating to ASN.1 Object Identifiers [2018-04-10]",

The base requirement was to provide at least the same security features as LTE.\n\nNon-Standalone NR Security\n\nThe NSA architecture uses LTE as the master radio access technology, while the new radio access technology (i.e. NR) serves as secondary radio access technology with User Equipment's (UEs) connected to both radios. Except for capability negotiation, security procedures for EN-DC basically follow the specifications for dual connectivity security for LTE. The WI summary for EDCE5 security (cf. corresponding clause above) provides details.\n\nEvolution of the trust model\n\nMoving on from the Non-Standalone deployment, in a Standalone 5G system, the trust model has evolved. Trust within the network is considered as decreasing the further one moves from the core. This has impact on decisions taken in 5G security design, thus we present the trust model in this section.\n\nThe trust model in the UE is reasonably simple: there are two trust domains, the tamper proof UICC on which the Universal Subscriber Identity Module (USIM) resides as trust anchor and the Mobile Equipment (ME). The ME and the USIM together form the UE.\n\nThe network side trust model for roaming and non-roaming cases are shown in the two following figures respectively, which shows the trust in multiple layers, like in an onion.\n\nThe Radio Access Network (RAN) is separated into distributed units (DU, or gNB-DU) and central units (CU, or gNB-CU) - DU and CU together form the gNB, as seen above. The DU does not have any access to customer communications as it may be deployed in unsupervised sites. The CU and Non-3GPP Inter Working Function (N3IWF - not shown in the figures), which terminates the Access Stratum (AS) security, will be deployed in sites with more restricted access.\n\nIn the Core Network, the Access Management Function (AMF) serves as termination point for Non-Access Stratum (NAS) security. Currently, i.e. in the 3GPP 5G Phase 1 specification, the AMF is collocated with the SEcurity Anchor Function (SEAF) that holds the root key (known as anchor key) for the visited network. The security architecture is defined in a future proof fashion, as it allows separation of the security anchor from the mobility function that could be possible in a future evolution of the system architecture.\n\nThe AUthentication Function (AUSF) keeps a key for reuse, derived after authentication, in case of simultaneous registration of a UE in different access network technologies, i.e. 3GPP access networks and non-3GPP access networks such as IEEE 802.11 Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN). Authentication credential Repository and Processing Function (ARPF) keeps the authentication credentials. This is mirrored by the USIM on the side of the client, i.e. the UE side. The subscriber information is stored in the Unified Data Repository (UDR). The Unified Data Management (UDM) uses the subscription data stored in UDR and implements the application logic to perform various functionalities such as authentication credential generation, user identification, service and session continuity etc. Over the air interface, both active and passive attacks are considered on both control plane and user plane. Privacy has become increasingly important leading to permanent identifiers being kept secret over the air interface.\n\nIn the roaming architecture, the home and the visited network are connected through SEcurity Protection Proxy (SEPP) for the control plane of the internetwork interconnect. This enhancement is done in 5G because of the number of attacks coming to light recently such as key theft and re-routing attacks in SS7 and network node impersonation and source address spoofing in signalling messages in DIAMETER that exploited the trusted nature of the internetwork interconnect.\n\n5G Phase 1 Security (Release 15)\n\n5G Phase 1 brings several enhancements to LTE security, some of the key points are presented in this section. Details of 5G Phase 1 security can be found in TS 33.501 [1].\n\nPrimary authentication: Network and device mutual authentication in 5G is based on primary authentication. This is similar to LTE but there are a few differences. The authentication mechanism has in-built home control allowing the home operator to know whether the device is authenticated in a given network and to take final call of authentication. In 5G Phase 1 there are two mandatory authentication options: 5G Authentication and Key Agreement (5G-AKA) and Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)-AKA', i.e. EAP-AKA'. Optionally, other EAP based authentication mechanisms are also allowed in 5G - for specific cases such as private networks. Also, primary authentication is radio access technology independent, thus it can run over non-3GPP technology such as IEEE 802.11 WLANs.\n\nSecondary authentication: Secondary authentication in 5G is meant for authentication with data networks outside the mobile operator domain. For this purpose, different EAP based authentication methods and associated credentials can be used. A similar service was possible in LTE as well, but now it is integrated in the 5G architecture.\n\nInter-operator security: Several security issues exist in the inter-operator interface arising from SS7 or Diameter [5,6] in the earlier generations of mobile communication systems. To counter these issues, 5G Phase 1 provides inter-operator security from the very beginning.\n\nPrivacy: Subscriber identity related issues have been known since LTE and earlier generations of mobile systems. In 5G a privacy solution is developed that protects the user's subscription permanent identifier against active attacks. A home network public key is used to provide subscriber identity privacy.\n\nService based architecture (SBA): The 5G core network is based on a service based architecture, which did not exist in LTE and earlier generations. Thus 5G also provides adequate security for SBA.\n\nCentral Unit (CU) - Distributed Unit (DU): In 5G the base-station is logically split in CU and DU with an interface (the F1) between them. Security is provided for the CU-DU interface. This split was also possible in LTE, but in 5G it is part of the architecture that can support a number of deployment options (e.g. co-located CU-DU deployment is also possible). The DUs, which are deployed at the very edge of the network, don't have access to any user data when confidentiality protection is enabled. Even with the CU-DU split, the air interface security point in 5G remains the same as in LTE, namely in the radio access network.\n\nKey hierarchy: The 5G hierarchy reflects the changes in the overall architecture and the trust model using the security principle of key separation. One main difference in 5G compared to LTE is the possibility for integrity protection of the user plane.\n\nMobility: Although mobility in 5G is similar to LTE, the difference in 5G is the assumption that the mobility anchor in the core network can be separated from the security anchor.\n\nReferences",

Operators have met this challenge by increasing capacity with new radio spectrum, adding multi-antenna techniques and implementing more efficient modulation and coding schemes.\n\nHowever, these measures alone are insufficient in the most crowded environments and at cell edges where performance can significantly degrade. Operators are also adding small cells and tightly-integrating these with their macro networks to spread traffic loads, widely maintain performance and service quality while reusing spectrum most efficiently.\n\nOne way to expand an existing macro-network, while maintaining it as a homogeneous network, is to \"densify\" it by adding more sectors per eNB or deploying more macro-eNBs. However, reducing the site-to-site distance in the macro-network can only be pursued to a certain extent because finding new macro-sites becomes increasingly difficult and can be expensive, especially in city centres. An alternative is to introduce small cells through the addition of low-power base stations (eNBs, HeNBs or Relay Nodes (RNs)) or Remote Radio Heads (RRH) to existing macro-eNBs. Site acquisition is easier and cheaper with this equipment which is also correspondingly smaller.\n\nSmall cells are primarily added to increase capacity in hot spots with high user demand and to fill in areas not covered by the macro network - both outdoors and indoors. They also improve network performance and service quality by offloading from the large macro-cells. The result is a heterogeneous network with large macro-cells in combination with small cells providing increased bitrates per unit area. See Figure 1.\n\nHeterogeneous network planning was already used in GSM. The large and small cells in GSM are separated through the use of different frequencies. This solution is still possible in LTE. However, LTE networks mainly use a frequency reuse of one to maximize utilization of the licensed bandwidth.\n\nIn heterogeneous networks the cells of different sizes are referred to as macro-, micro-, pico- and femto-cells; listed in order of decreasing base station power. The actual cell size depends not only on the eNB power but also on antenna position, as well as the location environment; e.g. rural or city, indoor or outdoor . The HeNB (Home eNB) was introduced in LTE Release 9 (R9). It is a low power eNB which is mainly used to provide indoor coverage, femto-cells, for Closed Subscriber Groups (CSG), for example, in office premises. See Figure 2.\n\nSpecific to HeNBs, is that they are privately owned and deployed without coordination with the macro-network. If the frequency used in the femto-cell is the same as the frequency used in the macro-cells, and the femto-cell is only used for CSG, then there is a risk of interference between the femto-cell and the surrounding network.\n\nThe Relay Node (RN) is another type of low-power base station added to the LTE R10 specifications. The RN is connected to a Donor eNB (DeNB) via the Un radio interface, which is based on the LTE Uu interface. See Figure 2. When the frequencies used on Uu and Un for the RN are the same, there is a risk of self interference in the RN. From the UE perspective the RN will act as an eNB, and from the DeNB's view the RN will be seen as a UE. As also mentioned, RRHs connected to an eNB via fibre can be used to provide small cell coverage.\n\nIntroducing a mix of cell sizes and generating a heterogeneous network adds to the complexity of network planning. In a network with a frequency reuse of one, the UE normally camps on the cell with the strongest received DL signal (SSDL), hence the border between two cells is located at the point where SSDL is the same in both cells. In homogeneous networks, this also typically coincides with the point of equal path loss for the UL (PLUL) in both cells. In a heterogeneous network, with high-power nodes in the large cells and low-power nodes in the small cells, the point of equal SSDL will not necessarily be the same as that of equal PLUL. See Figure 3.\n\nA major issue in heterogeneous network planning is to ensure that the small cells actually serve enough users. One way to do that is to increase the area served by the small cell, which can be done through the use of a positive cell selection offset to the SSDL of the small cell. This is called Cell Range Extension (CRE). See Figure 4.\n\nA negative effect of this is the increased interference on the DL experienced by the UE located in the CRE region and served by the base station in the small cell. This may impact the reception of the DL control channels in particular.\n\nA number of features added to the 3GPP LTE specification can be used to mitigate the above-mentioned interference problem in heterogeneous networks with small cells:\n\nICIC was introduced in R8. The eNBs can communicate using ICIC via the X2 interface to mitigate inter-cell interference for UEs at the cell edge. The X2AP message used for this is called \"Load Information\". See Figure 5. Through the \"Load Information\" message an eNB can inform neighbouring eNBs about: UL interference level per Physical Resource Block (PRB); UL PRBs that are allocated to cell edge UEs, and hence are sensitive to UL interference; and if DL Tx power is higher or lower than a set threshold value. The eNBs receiving these messages can use the received information to optimize scheduling for UEs at cell edges.\n\nICIC has evolved to better support heterogeneous network deployments -- especially interference control for DL control channels. Enhanced ICIC (eICIC) was introduced in LTE R10. The major change is the addition of time domain ICIC, realized through use of Almost Blank Subframes (ABS). ABS includes only control channels and cell-specific reference signals, no user data, and is transmitted with reduced power. When eICIC is used, the macro-eNB will transmit ABS according to a semi-static pattern. During these subframes, UEs at the edge, typically in the CRE region of small cells, can receive DL information, both control and user data. The macro-eNB will inform the eNB in the small cell about the ABS pattern. See Figure 6.\n\nICIC is evolved in LTE R11 to further enhanced ICIC (feICIC). The focus here is interference handling by the UE through inter-cell interference cancellation for control signals, enabling even further cell range extension.\n\neICIC and feICIC are especially important when Carrier Aggregation (CA) is not used.\n\nCarrier Aggregation (CA) is introduced in R10, with backward compatibility to R8, to increase the total bandwidth available to UEs and hence their maximum bitrates. When CA is used a number of R8 carriers, referred to as Component Carriers (CC), are aggregated and any CA-capable UE can be allocated resources on all CCs, while R8/R9 UEs can only be allocated resources on one CC. Cross-carrier scheduling is an important feature in heterogeneous networks. Using cross-carrier scheduling it is possible to map the Physical DL control channels (PDCCH) on different CCs in the large and small cells. See Figure 7. The PDCCH, carrying DL Control Information (DCI) with scheduling information, must be received by the UEs at the cell edge; PDCCH may be transmitted with higher power than the traffic channels. Hence, using different carriers for the PDCCH in the large and small cells reduces the risk of PDCCH interference.\n\nFrom LTE R11 onwards it is possible to handle CA with CCs requiring different timing advance (TA); for example, combining CCs from eNBs with CCs from RRHs. See Figure 8.\n\nOne way to ensure that a UE is using both the best DL and the best UL carrier in a heterogeneous network is to use CoMP, introduced in LTE R11. With CoMP a number of transmission/reception points (i.e. eNBs, RNs or RRHs) can be coordinated to provide service to a UE - for example, data can be transmitted at the same time in the same PRBs from more than one transmission point to one UE, or data can be received from one transmission point in one subframe and from another transmission point in the next subframe. CoMP can be used both in DL and UL. When CoMP is used in a heterogeneous network a number of macro-cells and small cells can be involved in data transmission to and from one UE. Especially useful in heterogeneous networks is the possibility for a UE in the cell range extension region to utilize the best UL in the small cell and the best DL in the macro-cell. See Figure 9. This, however, requires that the macro-eNB and the base station in the small cell are synchronized, and most likely it will require a combination of macro-eNB with RRHs in the small cell.\n\nFurther enhancements regarding heterogeneous network and small cells are coming in future 3GPP Releases. At the time of writing, Release 12 is still in the process of being formulated with some features in the study phase and others, such as work on interference management for neighbour TDD cells, dual connectivity between the macro cell and small cells, mobility planning within hyper-dense environments and advances in carrier aggregation combinations already in the normative phase (specifications).\n\nFuture updates to this paper will include what has been achieved with the completion of Release 12 during the second half of 2014.\n\n\"...Coordinating the low-power layer of small cells with the macro network improves performance across the entire network while also further boosting efficiencies in spectrum use and power consumption, automating network configuration and optimization. The upcoming 3GPP Release 12 (due to be frozen September 2014) standardises various capabilities in these developments including dual connectivity, small cell on/off and 256 QAM...\" ...Read the full article",

The SON architecture can be a centralized, distributed or a hybrid solution.\n\nThis is the dynamic plug-and-play configuration of newly deployed eNBs. The eNB will by itself configure the Physical Cell Identity, transmission frequency and power, leading to faster cell planning and rollout.\n\nThe interfaces S1 and X2 are dynamically configured, as well as the IP address and connection to IP backhaul. To reduce manual work ANR (Automatic neighbour relations) is used. ANR configures the neighbouring list in newly deployed eNBs and is optimizing the list configuration during operation.\n\nDynamic configuration includes the configuration of the Layer 1 identifier, Physical cell identity (PCI) and Cell global ID (CGID). There are 504 different PCIs available in LTE, the PCI mapping shall fulfill the collision free condition as well as the confusion free. The PCI can be assigned either in a centralized or distributed way.\n\nWhen centralised assignment is used the OAM system will have a complete knowledge and control of the PCIs. When the distributed solution is used the OAM system assigns a list of possible PCIs to the newly deployed eNB, but the adoption of the PCI is in control of the eNB. The newly deployed eNB will request a report, sent either by User Equipment (UEs) over the air interface or by other eNBs over the X2 interface, including already in-use PCIs, see figure 1. - The eNB will randomly select its PCI from the remaining values.\n\nANR is used to minimize the work required for configuration in newly deployed eNBs as well as to optimize configuration during operation. Correct and up-to-date neighbouring lists will increase the number of successful handovers and minimize the number of dropped calls. Before a handover can be executed the source eNB requires the neighbouring information: PCI and CGID of the target eNB.\n\nThe PCI is included in every normal measurement report. The mapping between the PCI and CGID parameters can be done by using information from the OAM or reported by UEs decoding the target cell CGID on the broadcast channel in the target cell, see figure 2. The capability of decoding CGID is an optional UE feature.\n\nA network operator can put a cell on a ANR black list, to block certain handover candidates, for example from indoor to outdoor cells. 3GPP has also specified LTE Inter-Frequency and Inter-RAT (Radio Access Technology) ANR.\n\nFunctions for self-optimisation are mainly included in Release 9. It includes optimisation of coverage, capacity, handover and interference.\n\nMobility load balancing (MLB) is a function where cells suffering congestion can transfer load to other cells, which have spare resources. MLB includes load reporting between eNBs to exchange information about load level and available capacity.\n\nThe periodicity of the reporting can be requested in the range of 1 to 10 s. The report can contain, hardware load, S1 transport network load and Radio resource status. The Radio resource status reports are separated in Up Link and Down Link reports, including the total allocation guaranteed and non-guaranteed bit rate traffic, the percentage of allocated Physical Resource Block (PRB) and the percentage of PRBs available for load balancing.\n\nMLB can also be used between different Radio Technologies. In case of inter-RAT the load reporting RAN Information Management (RIM) protocol will be used to transfer the information via the core between the base stations of different radio technologies. A cell capacity class value, set by the OAM-system, will be used to compare and weigh the different technologies radio capacities against each other.\n\nA handover due to load balancing is carried out as a regular handover, but it may be necessary to amend parameters so that the User Equipment (UE) does not return to the congested cell. The amendment must take place in both cells, so that the handover settings remain coherent in both. The eNBs need to estimate how much the cell border needs to be shifted, expressed in dB, to avoid a quick return of the UE.\n\nMobility robustness optimization (MRO) is a solution for automatic detection and correction of errors in the mobility configuration. In Release 9 the focus is on errors causing Radio link failure (RLF) due to too late or early handover, or handover to an incorrect cell.\n\nIn case of late handover, see figure 3, the handover procedure in the source cell is initialized too late, since the UE is moving faster than the Handover (HO) parameter settings allow. Hence when the RRC HO command from the serving cell is transmitted the signal strength is too weak to reach the UE, now located in the target cell, connection is lost. The UE attempts a connection re-establishment, containing PCID and C-RNTI belonging to the source cell, but received by the target cell. The target eNB will then inform the source cell about RLF to adjust Handover parameters.\n\nIt is a bit more complicated to detect a too early handover, see figure 4. The UE has successfully been handed over from source cell A to target cell B, but since it was triggered too early the connection will drop almost immediately due to too poor radio conditions in the target cell B. The UE will then try to re-establish the connection, which will now take place in the original source cell, cell A, since this cell is the strongest one. The UE will use the PCID and RNTI from the target cell B and the source cell A will then consider this as a Radio Link Failure due to too late handover and send an indication to the target cell B. But the target cell B will now recognize the parameters in the indication, as given to a mobile that had just completed a handover to cell B from cell A now indicating failure. The target cell B will send back a report about too early Handover to adjust Handover parameters, to the source cell A.\n\nIn order to save energy some cells can be switched off when capacity is not needed. The power consumption in a base station is not only related to load, a number of functions requires power even if there are no users to serve. But, if a cell is switched off, in the legal operator license there are still requirements on coverage, the coverage must be maintained at all times! The suspension of the cell may occur when the last user leaves the cell, all incoming handovers during this period of time will then be rejected. The cells that remain on, providing coverage, can wake up a suspended cell when traffic load increase. This can be done with a wake-up call to the sleeping cell.\n\nRACH optimisation aims to minimise the number of attempts on the RACH channel, causing interference. The UE can be polled by the eNB for RACH statistics after connection. The number of preambles sent until successful RACH completion, and the number of contention resolution failure are in the statistics. But PRACH configuration parameters can also be distributed amongst eNBs, like zero correlation configuration, root sequence, high speed flag and PRACH frequency offset.\n\nFeatures for automatic detection and removal of failures and automatic adjustment of parameters are mainly specified in Release 10.\n\nCoverage and Capacity Optimization enables automatic correction of capacity problems depending on slowly changing environment, like seasonal variations.\n\nMinimization of drive tests (MDT), is enabling normal UEs to provide the same type of information as those collected in drive test. A great advantage is that UEs can retrieve and report parameters from indoor environments.",

This will enable broader range of verticals to integrate with 3GPP systems. Currently, multiple northbound API-related specifications already exist (e.g. APIs for Service Capability Exposure Function (SCEF) defined in TS 23.682 [1], APIs for the interface between MBMS service provider and BM-SC defined in TR 26.981 [2]).\n\nFor API consumers or invokers (in particular for 3rd party API developers), a consistent and uniform API framework across multiple northbound API specifications is necessary. In 3GPP Release-15, a Common API Framework (CAPIF) was introduced to support the common API aspects (e.g. authentication, authorization, publishing, discovery, access control policy, etc.), which allows the northbound service APIs to be integrated into CAPIF, such that the API invokers can utilize a single framework for accessing and invoking the 3GPP northbound APIs.\n\nTR 23.722 [3] is a (Stage 2) technical report that analyses existing API frameworks, and identifies requirements and potential architecture solutions to support a common approach for API development within 3GPP, including recommendations for the normative work.\n\nTS 23.222 [4] specifies the (Stage 2) functional architecture model, procedures and information flows needed to support the CAPIF, and guidelines for a consistent development of northbound API (service and CAPIF APIs) in 3GPP.\n\nTS 29.222 [5] specifies the detailed (Stage 3) APIs messages and protocols needed to support CAPIF, based on the Stage 2 functional architecture.\n\nThe CAPIF functional model is illustrated in Figure 2-1. The functional model describes the CAPIF core function (CCF) and API provider domain functions i.e. API exposing function (AEF), API publishing function (APF) and API management function (AMF), and as well as the reference points between these functions and the API invoker/consumer.\n\nThe functional model as described in TS 23.222 [4], specified architecture-level procedures and information flows for common API aspects, including onboarding, offboarding, publishing, unpublishing, update of service APIs, discovery, registration, authentication, authorization, logging, auditing, monitoring, and topology hiding.\n\nIt further specified the application of the functional model to CAPIF deployments (both centralized and distributed deployment), and also CAPIF relationship with network exposure functions defined in 3GPP systems (EPS and 5GS).\n\nThe detailed API specification (Stage 3) supporting the CAPIF functional model is provided in TS 29.222 [5], which translates the procedures and interactions over the reference points into following 9 API services (8 CAPIF core function services and 1 API exposing function service):\n\nReferences\n\n11.2.2\tNorthbound APIs for SCEF - SCS/AS Interworking\n\nSummary based on the input provided by Huawei, HiSilicon in SP-171032.\n\nStarting from Rel-13, 3GPP defined the Service Capabilities Exposure Function (SCEF) framework for exposure of those 3GPP network capabilities to the application domain. However, up until Rel-15, 3GPP specified neither the SCEF functional architecture nor its interactions with Service Capability Servers or Application Servers (SCS/AS), i.e. with the application domain. 3GPP was relying on other standardization fora such as OMA or oneM2M.\n\nTriggered by interactions with oneM2M, 3GPP started with Rel-15 to specify the northbound APIs from SCEF to support oneM2M specifications to facilitate a useable end-to-end M2M architecture.\n\nThe services and capabilities offered by SCEF to Service Capability Servers or Application Servers (application domain) include:\n\nThe interface between the SCEF and the SCS/AS is referred to as \"T8\" interface.

The vertical separations are the Ressource Blocks (RB), as defined in the previous section, i.e. a group of 12 subcarriers. The horizontal separations are the OFDM symbols. Four OFDM symbols together with 20 RBs form a so-called \"SS/PBCH (Synchronization Signals/ Physical Broadcast Channel) block\".\n\nThe PSS and NSS are transmitted over 127 subcarriers, i.e. about 10.5 RBs. (They are designed to carry the Physical Cell ID (PCID) selected from 1008 candidates.)\n Once synchronised with the PSS and NSS, the mobiles can retrieve the full SS/PBCH structure, and thus \"listen\" to the Physical Broadcast Channel (PBCH) and its associated Demodulation reference signals (DM-RS).\n\nThe PBCH carries only the minimum system information necessary for initial access, such as system frame number (SFN), initial configurations for PDCCH, PDSCH and DM-RS, and information required to determine the frame timing such as SS/PBCH block index and half-frame index. These are referred to as \"System Information Block 1 (SIB1)\".\n\nOne or multiple SS/PBCH blocks can be transmitted by using transmission beamforming within a half frame, with configurable periodicity from 5 ms to 160 ms. The maximum number of SS/PBCH blocks and the applicable subcarrier spacing for SS/PBCH block transmission are dependent on the frequency range, as shown in Table 5.5.4.3-1. They can be identical or different from the subcarrier spacing used for other DL transmissions.\n\nSIB1 and other system information (SIB2 and onwards) are carried by PDSCH which is scheduled by PDCCH. SIB1 contains necessary information to perform random access procedure for initial access.\n\nPaging message is carried by PDSCH which is scheduled by PDCCH. Numerology used for SIB1 transmission on a NR cell is indicated in master information block (MIB) carried by PBCH and is commonly applied to transmissions for other system information (SIB2 and onwards), Paging, Msg.2 (\"Message 2\", as explained below) and Msg.4 transmissions on the same cell.\n\nFor random access in NR, a four-step procedure consisting of Msg.1, Msg.2, Msg.3 and Msg.4 is defined. For Msg.1 i.e., PRACH transmission in random access, NR supports two types of PRACH sequences as the preamble sequence:\n\nFour different PRACH preamble formats based on the long ZC sequence are defined and corresponding numerology is defined for each PRACH preamble format as shown in Table 5.5.4.3-2.\n\nIn addition, nine different PRACH preamble formats based on the short ZC sequence are defined and corresponding numerology is defined for each PRACH preamble format as shown in Table 5.5.4.3-3.\n\nMsg.2 and Msg.4 for random access are carried by PDSCH that are scheduled by PDCCH.\n\nMsg.3 for random access is carried by PUSCH which is scheduled by random access response (RAR) in Msg.2 or PDCCH in case of retransmission.\n\nFor mobility measurement, SS/PBCH block and/or CSI-RS can be utilized in NR. SS/PBCH block based reference signal received power (RSRP), reference signal received quality (RSRQ) and signal-to-noise and interference ratio (SINR) are defined, and CSI-RS based RSRP, RSRQ and SINR are also defined. For radio link monitoring (RLM), SS/PBCH block and/or CSI-RS can be utilized as RLM reference signal in NR. One or multiple SS/PBCH blocks and/or CSI-RS resources are configured to be monitored to evaluate whether the radio link is in-sync status (i.e., in good quality) or out-of-sync status.",

The position information may be requested by and reported to a client (e.g., an application) associated with the UE, or by a client within or attached to the core network. The position information shall be reported in standard formats, such as those for cell-based or geographical co-ordinates, together with the estimated errors (uncertainty) of the position and velocity of the UE and, if available, the positioning method (or the list of the methods) used to obtain the position estimate.\n\nRestrictions on the geographic shape encoded within the 'position information' parameter may exist for certain LCS client types. The 5GS, including NG-RAN, shall comply with any shape restrictions defined in 5GS and, in a particular country, with any shape restrictions defined for a specific LCS client type in relevant national standards. For example, in the US, national standard J-STD-036-C-2 restricts the geographic shape for an emergency services LCS client to minimally either an \"ellipsoid point\" or an \"ellipsoid point with uncertainty circle\" as defined in TS 23.032 [4].\n\nIt shall be possible for the majority of the UEs within a network to use the LCS feature without compromising the radio transmission or signalling capabilities of the NG-RAN.\n\nThe uncertainty of the position measurement shall be network-implementation-dependent, at the choice of the network operator. The uncertainty may vary between networks as well as from one area within a network to another. The uncertainty may be hundreds of metres in some areas and only a few metres in others. In the event that a particular position measurement is provided through a UE-assisted process, the uncertainty may also depend on the capabilities of the UE. In some jurisdictions, there is a regulatory requirement for location service accuracy that is part of an emergency service. Further details of the accuracy requirements can be found in TS 22.071 [3].\n\nThe uncertainty of the position information is dependent on the method used, the position of the UE within the coverage area and the activity of the UE. Several design options of the NG-RAN system (e.g., size of cell, adaptive antenna technique, pathloss estimation, timing accuracy, ng-eNB and gNB surveys) shall allow the network operator to choose a suitable and cost-effective UE positioning method for their market.\n\nThere are many different possible uses for the positioning information. The positioning functions may be used internally by the 5GS, by value-added network services, by the UE itself or through the network, and by \"third party\" services. The feature may also be used by an emergency service (which may be mandated or \"value-added\"), but the location service is not exclusively for emergencies.\n\nDesign of the NG-RAN positioning capability as documented in this specification includes position methods, protocols and procedures that are either adapted from capabilities already supported for E-UTRAN, UTRAN and GERAN, or created separately from first principles. In contrast to GERAN and UTRAN but similarly to E-UTRAN, the NG-RAN positioning capabilities are intended to be forward compatible to other access types and other position methods, in an effort to reduce the amount of additional positioning support needed in the future. This goal also extends to user plane location solutions such as OMA SUPL ([15], [16]), for which NG-RAN positioning capabilities are intended to be compatible where appropriate.\n\nAs a basis for the operation of UE Positioning in NG-RAN, the following assumptions apply:",

This service component controls the transfer of the trace records from the NEFs to the OSF. The conceptual model is illustrated in figure 5, which employs both the event report function (CCITT X.734 [14]) and the log control function (CCITT X.735 [15]).\n\nThe trace control function collects traceable events within the NEF and formats them into trace records. These trace records may be stored locally within the NEF filestore or transferred to the OSF in the form of event reports. This is controlled by means of the \"priority\" indicator, which is a part of the trace type. If the \"priority\" indicator is not set then the trace records shall stored within the local filestore and subsequently transferred to the OSF in bulk via FTAM.\n\nIf a trace is activated with the \"priority\" indicator set then the trace records shall be sent to the OSF either direct by the trace control function or through Event Forwarding Discriminators (EFDs).\n\nIf EFDs are used then all trace records are offered to the EFDs. The EFDs determine which of the records are to be transmitted to the OSF in the form of event reports and the Operation System Id field in the header is ignored. The EDFs have complex filter constructs, which allow the operator to define the criteria for destinations and filters.\n\nIf EFDs are not used then all priority records are forwarded to the OSF whose address is given in the Operation System Id field. The NEF is required to supply additional information to provide the OS management application entity title.\n\nFinally, the trace records may also be stored in the form of log entries within the log of the NEF. It is up to the operator to decide if the log function is needed in parallel with the event reporting and file store. Once stored, the log records may be individually accessed by the OSF via the appropriate object management functions. Care should be taken of filter criteria for log records to avoid unnecessary overheads.\n\nThis service component contains the following groups of TMN management functions:\n\n9.2\tTransfer of Records\n\n9.2.1\tBulk record transfer\n\nThis group of TMN functions is concerned with the bulk transfer of trace records from the NEF record filestore to the OSF.\n\nThe trace records shall be transferred from the NEF to the OSF by the use of FTAM services. For further details of the use of FTAM see GSM 12.01 [8].\n\nIn addition to the simple file transfer services provided by FTAM, peertopeer application process communication may also be supported. The use of CMIS services for the uploading of files from the NEF to the OSF is specified in the GSM 12.00 [7].\n\nWhen the procedure defined in GSM 12.00 [7] and GSM 12.01 [8] are used to transfer the trace records, the file type shall be traceRecords and the format of the file is given by the type TraceFileFormat.\n\n9.2.2\tLog control\n\nThis function permits the trace record to be stored and retrieved from logs within the NEF. The logging of these records is performed in accordance with the log control function specified in CCITT X.735 [15] and no additional management functions are required.\n\n9.2.3\tLog access\n\nThis TMN function controls the access to the log described above. Each log defined may contain one or more log entries. Each log entry contains a single trace record.\n\nFor further details concerning the use of logs, see CCITT X.735 [15].\n\nThe following system management functions are required:\n\n9.2.4\tEvent Reporting\n\n9.2.4.1\tEvent Forwarding Discriminators\n\nFor shortterm recording of tracing events and for more complicated filter conditions the event forwarding discriminator construct defined in CCITT X.734 [14] and CCITT X.721 [13] can be employed. The event forwarding discriminator construct is extremely flexible permitting the combination of a number of fields and logical operations with a wide variety of scheduling options. The EFD also controls the destinations to which the event reports are sent. Several such filters may be defined and scheduled for operation at different times and for different time periods.\n\nThe following system management functions are required:\n\n9.2.4.2\tDirect Transfer by Trace Control Function\n\nThis function permits the NEF to transmit trace records direct to the OSF. In general the trace record shall be sent on completion of the call or the traceable event. This function is controlled by means of the \"priority\" indicator, which is contained in the trace type. If the priority indicator is not set, then the trace records shall be stored on file within the NE filestore. These records may be subsequently collected via bulk record transfer as described in subclause 9.2.1. If the trace type specified on activation includes the \"priority\" indicator then all of the records shall be sent via trace reports to the OSF specified by the operation system id.\n\nThe following system management functions are required:",

The AMF then sends a location services request to an LMF. The LMF processes the location services request which may include transferring assistance data to the target UE to assist with UE-based and/or UE-assisted positioning and/or may include positioning of the target UE. The LMF then returns the result of the location service back to the AMF (e.g., a position estimate for the UE.

Most of these main characteristics would lead to some addition / modification of PLDC and MAC frame structure. These detailed changes will be summarized in each corresponding sections. If you are not familiar with WLAN frame structure and basic operations I would recommend you to go through WLAN Frame structure and WLAN protocol page first.\n\nAs in almost every evolution of every communication technology (except IoT), the major motivation of 802.11ac is to achieve much higher throughput than the previous highest throughput technology (802.11n in this case). I am pretty sure that you will see another technology targeted for even higher throughput than 802.11ac (We are already hearing of 802.11ad).\n\nThen what is the technical strategy to achieve this high throughput ? Overall strategy is also same as other technology (If you have seen the evolution process of celluar technology (e.g, WCDMA -> HSPA -> DC HSPA or LTE -> LTE MIMO -> Carrier Aggregation etc), you will easily understand the strategy. Some of the technologies for this evolution can be listed as follows\n\nWith the list in mind, if you try to correlate each of these technologies to each items of specification of 802.11ac, it will be much easier to get the big picture or motivation of those specification.\n\nJust to give you more practical insight on this motivation, I would compare 802.11n (the most advanced technology before 802.11ac) and 802.11ac with the respect t the features/technologies listed above. (NOTE : I got most of these information from Ref [13]. I would recommend you to read through this document at least once if you have time)\n\nNo new technology can be invented overnight. We all understand this. However, we don't want to wait forever until everything is ready all at once. A common practice in this case is to split those requirement/wishlist into multiple chunks and attack them chunk by chunk. In some technology, they call these chunk as 'Stage' (like Stage 1, Stage 2 etc) and in some technology they call them as 'Phase' (e.g, Phase 1, Phase 2 etc). In 802.11ac, they call them as Wave (e.g, Wave 1, Wave 2 etc). 802.11ac has been evolved as two Waves (at least as of now, Aug 2016) as listed below.\n\nIf you have a 802.11ac WLAN Card (device), the first thing you have to do is to figure out the Access Point (AP) around the device support 802.11ac. (Actually you don't need to figure out this, your WLAN device will figure out :).\n\nThen how your WLAN device will figure out whether the AP support 802.11ac or not ? It is by decoding the special information signal from the AP called Beacon. If your AP support 802.11ac, it will broadcast Beancon signal containing following information.\n\nFollowing Beacon Signal is the one from a WLAN Test equipment, Anritsu MT8862. Anritsu kindly provided me a full sample log starting from Beacon through user data and it will be a great resource for my study. I will sharing more as I learn more from the log. You can see the test setup on how this log is captured.\n\nIt may look simple two lines of information, but it will contain a lot of details of the 802.11ac capability that the AP supports. Following is the full decoded information.\n\n.... .... .... .... .... .... .... ..10 = Maximum MPDU Length: 11 454 (0x00000002)\n\n.... .... .... .... .... .... .... 00.. = Supported Channel Width Set: Neither 160MHz\n\n.... .... .... .... .... .... .0.. .... = Short GI for 160MHz and 80+80MHz: Not supported\n\n.... .... .... .... 000. .... .... .... = Compressed Steering Number of Beamformer Antennas\n\n.... .... .... .000 .... .... .... .... = Number of Sounding Dimensions: 1 (0x00000000)\n\n.... .... .0.. .... .... .... .... .... = +HTC-VHT Capable (VHT variant HT Control field):\n\n.... ..11 1... .... .... .... .... .... = Max A-MPDU Length: 1 048 575 (0x00000007)\n\n.... 00.. .... .... .... .... .... .... = VHT Link Adaptation: No Feedback (0x00000000)\n\n...0 .... .... .... .... .... .... .... = Rx Antenna Pattern Consistency: Not supported\n\n..0. .... .... .... .... .... .... .... = Tx Antenna Pattern Consistency: Not supported\n\n...0 0000 0000 0000 = Rx Highest Long GI Data Rate (in Mb/s, 0 = subfield not in use):\n\n...0 0000 0000 0000 = Tx Highest Long GI Data Rate (in Mb/s, 0 = subfield not in use):\n\nCommunication is the exchange of information between two or more parties. The previous section showed how the device can figure out the 802.11ac capability of AP. Then you would ask how the AP can figure out 802.11ac capability of the device. The AP can figure out the device capability from [Probe Request] message from the device as shown below.\n\n.... .... .... .... .... .... .... ..0. = Receive Staggered Sounding: Not supported\n\n.... .... .... .... .00. .... .... .... = Receiver can return explicit uncompressed\n\n...0 0... .... .... .... .... .... .... = Maximum number of space time streams for\n\n.... .... .... .... .... .... .... ..10 = Maximum MPDU Length: 11 454 (0x00000002)\n\n.... .... .... .... 010. .... .... .... = Compressed Steering Number of Beamformer\n\n.... .... .0.. .... .... .... .... .... = +HTC-VHT Capable (VHT variant HT Control\n\n.... ..11 1... .... .... .... .... .... = Max A-MPDU Length:1 048 575 (0x00000007)\n\n...1 .... .... .... .... .... .... .... = Rx Antenna Pattern Consistency:Supported\n\n..1. .... .... .... .... .... .... .... = Tx Antenna Pattern Consistency:Supported\n\nOne of the most important keywords in 802.11ac would VHT. VHT stands for Very High Throughput. You would not need any additional explanation on what this means. The meaning is obvious and self-explanatory.\n\nThe question is how to achieve VHT and what kind of new frames and protocols are introduced to implement this.\n\nIn wireshark log, you may see this framing information from Radiotap Header as shown below.\n\n802.11ac support various types of bandwidth combination like 20 Mhz, 80 Mhz, 160 Mhz. Then the question would 'how do they allocate the bandwidth ?'. Statically or Dynamically ?\n\nStatic allocation means that Transmitter (Initiator) and Reciever(Responder) negotiate and determines the bandwidth during early stage of connection setup and keep it same until the end of communication (a session).\n\nDynamic allocation means that Transmitter and Reciever SOMEHOW negotiate/determine the bandwidth in very short interval even during a single session.\n\n802.11ac picked up the dynamic allocation approach. It allows the change of the bandwidth at every transmission.\n\nThen the question is 'HOW ?'. What kind of negotiation they use to determine/agree upon the bandwidth between Transmitter and Reciever ?\n\nBasic Idea is simple. As you see in Data Transmission in Detail section, basic channel acquisition process for all 802.11 is based on RTS/CTS mechanism. 802.11ac use the same mechanism to determine the avaiable bandwidth dynamically. The idea is to split the whole possible 802.11ac band into multiple blocks of basic segments (e.g, 20 Mhz, 40 Mhz, 80 Mhz etc) and perform the multiple RTS/CTS simulateneously across the multiple frequency block. (It is very similary for Carrier Aggregation in LTE). First, the initiator sends multiple RTS accross the multiple frequency block and wait for CTS. If the initiator recieves CTS accross the all the blocks, it can use all the frequency blocks (very wide aggregated bandwidth). If the initiator recieves only a few CTS for the all transmitted RTS, it uses the smaller bandwidth for which CTS is recieved. (Refer to Ref [9] for the details).\n\nLet me give you a couple of examples with illustration on how Dynamic Bandwidth goes. Here goes only two cases but there can be much more variations on this.\n\nThis is the case where there is no interference between Node A(initiator) and Node B(recipient) and the full bandwith is avaiable for both nodes. Of course, these nodes does not know anything about the bandwidth availability before it completes step 3. Step 0 : Right before Step 1, it is assumed that Node A split the whole 80 Mhz section into 4 contiguous 20 Mhz block and performed carrier sensing for each of these 20 Mhz block. And it is assumed that all of these 20 Mhz block turned out to be available. Step 1 : Node A wait for a certain time period called DIFS(DCF Inter Frame Space), assuming that the scheduling is done in DCF. Step 2 : Node A transmit RTS for each of 20 Mhz block to Node B using 802.11a frame and it is assumed that all of these RTS reached Node B successfully. Step 3 : (Assuming that Node B detected RTS for all of 20 Mhz blocks) Node B transmit CTS using 802.11a frame for every 20 Mhz subblocks. Step 4 : (Assuming that Node A detected CTS for all of 20 Mhz blocks) Node A assumes that all 80Mhz BW is clear/no-interference and transmit the data in 802.11ac mode utilizing the full 80 Mhz. Step 5 : (Assuming that Node B received and decoded the whole data) Node B sends Ack for every 20 Mhz blocks (40 Mhz in total).\n\nThis is the case where there is some interference in some spectrum blocks within the 80 Mhz block on Node B(recipient). Of course, these nodes does not know anything about the bandwidth availability before it completes step 3. Step 0 : Right before Step 1, it is assumed that Node A split the whole 80 Mhz section into 4 contiguous 20 Mhz block and performed carrier sensing for each of these 20 Mhz block. And it is assumed that all of these 20 Mhz block turned out to be available. Step 1 : Node A wait for a certain time period called DIFS(DCF Inter Frame Space), assuming that the scheduling is done in DCF. Step 2 : Node A transmit RTS for each of 20 Mhz block to Node B using 802.11a frame. Step 3 : (In various reason, e.g, Node B failed to receive RTS due to interference or Medium is busy based on carrier sensing ) Node B transmit CTS using 802.11a frame for only two consecutive 20 Mhz blocks. Step 4 : (Assuming that Node A detected CTS for the two 20 Mhz blocks) Node A assumes that only 40Mhz BW is clear/no-interference and transmit the data in 802.11ac mode utilizing the 40 Mhz. Step 5 : (Assuming that Node B received and decoded the whole data) Node B sends Ack for the two 20 Mhz blocks (40 Mhz in total).\n\nIn 802.11ac, Following new Frame Types are added to the existing type. Most of New Frametype is for impelementing Channel Measurement and Report to perform MU-MIMO Beamforming.\n\nThis frame is used for BeamFormer (AP) to initiate Channel Measurement Process. (Refer to 802.11ac 8.3.1.20 VHT NDP Announcement frame format for the details)\n\nIt indicates the number of columns, Nc, in the Compressed Beamforming Feedback Matrix\n\nThis frame is used for BeamFormee (user) to report channel measurement result (Refer to 802.11ac 8.5.23.2 VHT Compressed Beamforming frame format for the details)\n\nTo perform proper beamforming for specific devices, it is crucial to figure out accurate channel condition between BeamFormer and BeanFormee. To figure out the channel condition, BeamFormer and BeamFormee performs a specific sequence of calibration process and this process is called Channel Measurement or Sounding process. It goes as follows.\n\nRefer to 802.11ac 9.31.5.2 Rules for VHT sounding protocol sequences, Figure 9-41a and Figure 9-41a for the details.\n\nNOTE : The fundamental purpose of this complicated process is to figure out the charateristics (nature) of radio channel between the Access Point and Devices. This is also called 'Channel Sounding'. During this process, no user data is conveyed. It means this process can be a kind of overhead (throughput degradation factor). If AP can best optimize the communication by extracting the most suitable BeamForming parameters from this process, this process can give a overall throughput gain. However, if AP failed to get the best BeamForming parameters from this process, this would just create unncessary overhead.\n\nMU-MIMO stands for Multi User MIMO and this is adopted only in 802.11ac (not in 802.11n and lower). When we say MIMO(Multi Input Multi Output), it normally mean SU-MIMO(Single User MIMO), which is a MIMO targeted to only one device(user). On the contrary, MU-MIMO is the MIMO targeted to multiple user simulateneously. It mean that in MU-MIMO the transmitter (Access Point) can transmite the multiple stream of data targeted to multiple user.\n\nIt sounds fancy, right ? However, the implementation of this technology would not be as easy as it sound and real performance would not be as good as expected. Probably it would need to go through a long way of evolution. Let's think of some of the challenges and possible issues related to MU-MIMO\n\nPutting aside the practical feasibility of this MU-MIMO, the specification is done. In most case of technology (even though it is not all the case), once the specification is issued the technology continues to evolve and get better and better.\n\n802.11ac MU-MIMO Beamforming is expressed in a mathematical expression as follows (this is based on 802.11ac 22.3.11 SU-MIMO and DL-MU-MIMO Beamforming)\n\nWhenever a new version of any technology comes out, one of the most concerning thing is compatibility. Can this new stuff work with all of those old stuffs out there already ? You would have the same questions about 802.11ac. Is 802.11ac compatitle with the existing (previous) techology (e.g, 802.11a and 802.11n) ? The answer is Yes. 802.11ac is designed from beginning to be compatible with 802.11a / n both for Access point and devices.\n\n[12] How to validate the WI-FI Information within Wireshark Part I: Determining the WLAN capabilities",

In order to achieve wider bandwidth, carrier aggregation (CA) of up to 16 NR carriers is further supported. Both CA within a frequency band (intra-band CA) and CA across frequency bands (inter-band CA) are supported. For the case of inter-band CA, CA with different numerologies, e.g., CA between NR carrier in FR1 and NR carrier in FR2, is also supported.\n\nNR newly defines the concept of bandwidth part (BWP). A UE can be configured with up to four BWPs per NR carrier for DL and UL, respectively. Each BWP has its own parameters including bandwidth and numerology. The bandwidth of the BWP is configured for each UE according to the UE capability on supported maximum bandwidth, and hence multiple UEs having different bandwidth capabilities can be served in a single wideband NR carrier. Also, multiple BWPs with different numerologies can be multiplexed within a single NR carrier to support different types of services. The bandwidth of the BWP can be narrower than the supported maximum bandwidth for the UE so that UE power saving is achieved. In addition, BWP adaptation based on switching between BWPs having different bandwidths and/or numerologies is supported.\n\nFor EN-DC operation, simultaneous UL transmissions across LTE and NR are supported. However, for some band combinations, e.g., band combinations where simultaneous UL transmissions are difficult due to inter-modulation issue, an operation based on single UL transmission i.e., either LTE or NR UL transmission at a time is supported.",

The channel coding schemes for different UCI sizes are shown in Table 5.5.4.2-2.\n\nFor HARQ-ACK feedback of PDSCH with corresponding DCI, PUCCH resource set(s) containing one or more PUCCH resources are configured. One PUCCH resource is determined based on the UCI payload size and the PUCCH resource indicator field in the DL assignment. For HARQ-ACK feedback of PDSCH without corresponding DCI, SR, and CSI report, a PUCCH resource is configured for each. When multiple PUCCHs are overlapped fully or partially in time, the UCIs are multiplexed in a PUCCH. When a PUCCH is overlapped with a PUSCH fully or partially in time, the UCI is multiplexed (i.e. piggybacked) on the PUSCH.\n\nEach PUCCH resource is configured with a PUCCH format. Various PUCCH formats are specified as in Figure 5.5.4.6-1. Each PUCCH format supports either durations of 1 to 2 symbols, or durations of 4 to 14 symbols. PUCCH formats 0/2 are called as short-PUCCH, which can deliver UCI by 1 or 2 symbols. PUCCH formats 0/2 are beneficial to reduce latency. PUCCH formats 1/3/4 are called as long-PUCCH, which can deliver UCI with any of 4 to 14 symbols. PUCCH formats 1/3/4 are adopted to improve coverage. The frequency/time-domain resources for PUCCH transmissions in NR are flexibly configurable. In PUCCH format 0/1/4, multiple PUCCH resources can be CDMed on the same time/frequency resource. A short-PUCCH can be TDMed with a long-PUCCH or a short PUCCH within a slot.\n\nPUSCH is used to transmit one TB. A DCI in a PDCCH can schedule a PUSCH transmission with DM-RS (and other RS if any). The PUSCH is transmitted based on the information in the PDCCH, for example, time/frequency-domain resource including frequency-hopping, modulation, and layer.

The system consists of the major components TRAU and BTS on the network side and the MS. On the network side, speech encoder (SPE) and channel encoder (CHE) as well as channel decoder (CHD) and speech decoder (SPD) are connected via the serial A-bis interface. For each link, quality information is derived by estimating the current channel state. Based on the channel state,  and also taking into consideration possible constraints from network control, the codec mode control, which is located on the network side, selects the codec modes to be applied.\n\nThe channel mode to use (TCH/AFS, TCH/AHS, O-TCH/AHS, TCH/WFS, O-TCH/WFS or O-TCH/WHS) is controlled by the network. Uplink and downlink always apply the same channel mode.\n\nFor codec mode adaptation the receiving side performs link quality measurements of the incoming link. The measurements are processed yielding a Quality Indicator. For uplink adaptation, the Quality Indicator is directly fed into the UL mode control unit. This unit compares the Quality Indicator with certain thresholds and generates, also considering possible constraints from network control, a Codec Mode Command indicating the codec mode to be used on the uplink. The Codec Mode Command is then transmitted inband to the mobile side where the incoming speech signal is encoded in the corresponding codec mode. For downlink adaptation, the DL Mode Request Generator within the mobile compares the DL Quality indicator with certain thresholds and generates a Codec Mode Request indicating the preferred codec mode for the downlink. The Codec Mode Request is transmitted inband to the network side where it is fed into the DL Mode Control unit. This unit generally grants the requested mode. However, considering possible constraints from network control, it may also override the request. The resulting codec mode is then applied for encoding of the incoming speech signal in downlink direction. Both for uplink and downlink, the presently applied codec mode is transmitted inband as Codec Mode Indication together with the coded speech data. At the decoder, the Codec Mode Indication is decoded and applied for decoding of the received speech data.\n\nCodec mode selection is done from a set of codec modes (ACS, Active Codec Set), which may include 1 to 4 AMR codec modes. Associated with this set is a list of 1 to 3 switching thresholds and hysteresis used by the DL Mode Request Generator and the UL mode control unit to generate the Codec Mode Requests and Codec Mode Commands. These configuration parameters (ACS, thresholds, hysteresis) are defined at call set-up and can be modified at handover or during a call.\n\n3.1.2\tOperation with ongoing Tandem Free Operation\n\nIf tandem free operation is ongoing (see 3GPP TS 28.062) then the speech signal has to be transmitted over two radio links, first uplink (MS1 to BTS1)  and then downlink (BTS2 to MS2), respectively symmetrically in the reverse direction. The optimal Codec Mode in direction MS1 to MS2 shall be derived from the Codec Mode Command for the first uplink (CMC1, within BTS1) and the Codec Mode Request derived for the second downlink (CMR2 within MS2) in the following way: MS2 shall send the CMR2 back to BTS2 in the usual way. BTS2 shall either accept this CMR2 (default) or may modify it according to network control needs: CMR2´. Then BTS2 shall send the CMR2´ further uplink to its TRAU2, to TRAU1 and downlink to BTS1 (see 3GPP TS 28.062 on how this transmission shall be handled on Abis and A interfaces). BTS1 combines the received CMR2´ with its own derived CMC1 by taking the minimum of both values. If needed, BTS1 may modify this minimum value according to own network control (--> CMC1´´) and shall send it finally downlink to MS1 as CMC. The identical procedure shall be performed in the reverse direction. Annex C gives an informative description.\n\n3.1.3\tOperation at handover with ongoing Tandem Free Operation\n\nBefore and during an handover at one or both sides of the MS-to-MS connection, it may be needed to freeze the codec mode adaptation for a short while, e.g. to optimise the common Active Codec Set, or to allow fast (re-)synchronisation between BTS and TRAU or to optimise the CMI Phase in downlink. Both BTSs may therefore enable or disable the codec mode adaptation (see 3GPP TS 28.062). As long as the codec mode adaptation is frozen to a specific codec mode, then this codec mode shall be used in both directions as long as tandem free operation is ongoing, or tandem free operation shall be discontinued. The Codec Mode Requests from the MSs may be taken into account to decide whether to continue TFO or not, but not for codec mode adaptation.",

This scenario therefore supports location of emergency sessions from roamers and USIM-less and other non-registered UEs, and requires that identifying information for the UE and AMF have been provided to the GMLC/LRF as described in clauses 6.10.1 and 6.10.3.\n\n6.10.3\tLocation continuity for Handover of an Emergency session from NG-RAN\nFigure 6.10.3-1 shows support for location continuity for handover of an emergency session from NG-RAN on the source side to either NG-RAN or another 3GPP RAN on the target side. The procedure applies when control plane location according to Figures 6.10.1-1 and 6.10.2-1 is used for location of the UE on the source side. The procedure is based on the procedures for location continuity currently defined in TS 23.271 clause 9.4.5.4.",

The \"Yes\" branch results in the sending of \"Update Location Area Negative Response\" toward the MSC (and the MS), with cause \"National Roaming Not Allowed.\" However, subscriber data shall not be deleted from the VLR. This is to avoid unnecessary HLR updating should the subscriber be allowed subsequently to roam in other LAs of the same MSC.\nSheet 1: Decision \"Access-Restriction-Data permits current RAT?\" performs a check on the subscriber's AccessRestrictionData information received from the HLR and either allows the operation to continue or rejects the Location Update. The decision is taken according to the following:\n\n-If AccessRestrictionData value includes \"GERAN not allowed\" and the LA/RA, where the MS accesses the network, is served by GERAN, then the subscriber's access is not permitted.\n-If AccessRestrictionData value includes \"UTRAN not allowed\" and the LA/RA, where the MS accesses the network is served by UTRAN, then the subscriber's access is not permitted.\nSheet 1: When the Location Update is not allowed because the subscriber access is restricted due to Administrative Restriction of Subscribers' Access feature, the flow results in the sending of \"Update Location Area Negative Response\" toward the MSC (and the MS). The recommended cause code is \"RAT not allowed\", but cause codes \"PLMN not allowed\" or \"National Roaming Not allowed\" may also be used based on operator configuration and the required MS behaviour.\n\nNote: For the mapping of MAP Process cause code values to values on the MM protocol interface see 3GPP TS 29.010.\nFor the MS behaviour determined on the received cause code see 3GPP TS 24.008.\nSheet 1: Decision \"Roaming restriction due to Unsupported Feature received in subscriber data?\" distinguishes whether or not the subscriber data received from the HLR indicates \"roaming restriction due to unsupported feature.\" The \"Yes\" branch results in the sending of \"Update Location Area Negative Response\" toward the MSC (and the MS), with cause \"National Roaming Not Allowed.\" However, subscriber data shall not be deleted from the VLR. This is to avoid unnecessary HLR updating should the subscriber be allowed subsequently to roam in other LAs of the same MSC.\nSheet 1: Decision \"Regional subscription restriction\" distinguishes whether or not the subscriber is allowed service in the target LA, which the VLR deduces based on regional subscription information received from the HLR. The \"Yes\" branch results in the sending of \"Update Location Area Negative Response\" toward the MSC (and the MS), with cause \"location area not allowed.\" However, subscriber data shall not be deleted from the VLR. This is to avoid unnecessary HLR updating should the subscriber be allowed subsequently to roam in other LAs of the same MSC.\n\nSheet 1: Causes \"National Roaming Not Allowed\" and \"RAT not allowed\" lead to sending of cause #13 (roaming not allowed in the Location Area) and #15 (no suitable cells in Location Area) respectively to the MS (see 3GPP TS 29.010). On receipt of cause #13 or #15 the TMSI and LAI currently stored in the MS are not deleted (see 3GPP TS 24.008). As an option (referred-to as \"TMSI option\"), for these two reject causes, the VLR may forward a new TMSI (with the new LAI) together with the sending of \"Update Location Area Negative Response\" toward the MSC. The Location Updating Reject is sent to the MS after forwarding of the new TMSI (and new LAI) (see subclause 4.1.1.1).\nThis optional TMSI allocation (with new LAI) ensures that:\nSheet 2: If the MS performs a location update procedure in a VPLMN supporting Autonomous CSG Roaming and the HPLMN has enabled Autonomous CSG Roaming in the VPLMN (via Service Level Agreement) and if the VLR needs to retrieve the CSG Subscription Data of the MS from the CSS, the VLR shall initiate the Update VCSG Location Procedure with the CSS and store the CSG Subscription data if any received from the CSS. The stored CSG Subscription data is used by VLR to perform access control for the MS.\n\nIf the Update VCSG Location Procedure fails, the VLR continues the location update procedure.\nSheet 3: The procedure Check_IMEI_VLR is specified in 3GPP TS 23.018 [5a].",

A fallback operation to the legacy timing of n+4 is still supported by scheduling from the common search space (CSS), while the short processing time is applicable when scheduling from the user-specific search space (USS). The fallback results in possible collision between n+4 and n+3 timing in different/same DL subframe and/or same/different UL subframe. For example, the use of fallback results in possible uplink collision in the PUCCH format 1/1a/1b resource usage for the same UE when the two DL subframes have been scheduled targeting HARQ feedback in the same UL subframe. Collision handling has been specified to ensure a consistent UE behaviour.\n\nShort processing time is configured per component carrier (CC) by RRC and applies to both DL assignment to HARQ feedback and UL grant to UL transmission.\n\nShort processing time is associated with asynchronous HARQ operation on the UL, and hence PHICH is no longer considered for HARQ feedback of n+3 based scheduling (PHICH is still used for synchronous n+4 based scheduling). HARQ processes on DL are shared between n+4 and n+3 based scheduling, while there is no sharing of HARQ processes between synchronous (n+4) and asynchronous (n+3) HARQ on the UL. The HARQ content for a given UL subframe m can consist of HARQ bits for n+3 carriers as well as HARQ bits for n+4 carriers at the same time.\n\nSimilar to HARQ, shortened processing time also applies to CSI, so that a UE configured with shortened processing time for 1ms TTI will measure CSI on a reference resource no less than 3 subframes away (nCQI_ref greater or equal to 3) from the CSI report. For TM10, the legacy value of the delay between the CSI reference and the CSI report is reduced by 1 subframe (nCQI_ref = legacy value -1).\n\nSRS timing for UE configured with Short processing time is such that for a trigger received in subframe n, aperiodic SRS is transmitted in the first available subframe n+3 or later, subject to the given UL subframe being configured for SRS transmission.\n\nWhen the processing time is shortened, the timing advance takes up a proportionally larger part of the overall processing time available to the UE. A consequence of this is that the maximum timing advance for a CC configured with short processing time is reduced from 667 us to 200 us.",

It may use either the control- or user-plane protocols as underlying transport. In this specification, only control plane use of LPP is defined. User plane support of LPP is defined in [15] and [16].\n\nLPP messages are carried as transparent PDUs across intermediate network interfaces using the appropriate protocols (e.g., NGAP over the NG-C interface, NAS/RRC over the LTE-Uu and NR-Uu interfaces). The LPP protocol is intended to enable positioning for NR and LTE using a multiplicity of different position methods, while isolating the details of any particular positioning method and the specifics of the underlying transport from one another.\n\nThe protocol operates on a transaction basis between a target device and a server, with each transaction taking place as an independent procedure. More than one such procedure may be in progress at any given moment. An LPP procedure may involve a request/response pairing of messages or one or more \"unsolicited\" messages. Each procedure has a single objective (e.g., transfer of assistance data, exchange of LPP related capabilities, or positioning of a target device according to some QoS and use of one or more positioning methods). Multiple procedures, in series and/or in parallel, can be used to achieve more complex objectives (e.g., positioning of a target device in association with transfer of assistance data and exchange of LPP related capabilities). Multiple procedures also enable more than one positioning attempt to be ongoing at the same time (e.g., to obtain a coarse location estimate with low delay while a more accurate location estimate is being obtained with higher delay).\n\nAn LPP session is defined between a positioning server and the target device, the details of its relation with transactions are described in clause 4.1.2 of TS 36.355 [19].\n\nFor the 3GPP 5GS Control Plane solution defined in TS 23.501 [2] and TS 23.502 [26], the UE is the target device and the LMF is the server. For SUPL 2.0 support, the SUPL Enabled Terminal (SET) is the target device and the SUPL Location Platform (SLP) is the server. The operations controlled through LPP are described further in clause 7.1.\n\n6.2.2\tRadio Resource Control (RRC) for NR\n\nThe RRC protocol for NR is terminated between the gNB and the UE. It provides transport for LPP messages over the NR-Uu interface.\n\n6.2.3\tRadio Resource Control (RRC) for LTE\n\nThe RRC protocol for LTE is terminated between the ng-eNB and the UE. In addition to providing transport for LPP messages over the LTE-Uu interface, it supports transfer of measurements that may be used for positioning purposes through the existing measurement systems specified in TS 36.331 [13].",

The split of control plane and user plane via E1 interface enhances the split between gNB-CU (gNB central unit) and gNB-DU (gNB distributed unit) defined within the NR WI. It offers the possibility of:\n\n(1) optimizing the location of different RAN functions based on the deployment scenario, (2) support efficient radio resource isolation for network slicing, (3) independent scaling of CP and UP capacity.\n\nIn the NR WI, a split of the gNB into a gNB-CU and a gNB-DU is defined. The gNB-CU hosts the RRC, SDAP and PDCP radio protocols, while the gNB-DU hosts the PHY, MAC and RLC radio protocols. The gNB-CU and the gNB-DU are connected via the F1 interface. This WI complements the split defined in the NR WI by enabling to split the gNB-CU into a gNB-CU-CP and a gNB-CU-UP. The gNB-CU-CP hosts the RRC and the instance of the PDCP protocol serving the control plane, while the gNB-CU-UP hosts the SDAP and the instance of the PDCP protocol serving the user plane. The gNB-CU-CP and the gNB-CU-UP are connected via the E1 interface. The gNB-CU-CP is connected to the gNB-DU via the control plane part of the F1 interface (F1-C), while the gNB-CU-UP is connected to the gNB-DU via the user plane part of the F1 interface (F1-U). The resulting gNB architecture inclusive of both the CU-DU split and the CP-UP split, is illustrated in Figure 12.1-1.\n\nThe architecture shown in Figure 1 enables the following deployment scenarios [2]:\n\nThe call-flows showing the most relevant procedures involving the E1 interface (e.g., initial UE attach, handover, bearer context setup and release) are captured in TS 38.401 [3].

The E1 physical layer and the signalling transport, which is based on the SCTP/IP protocol stack, are described respectively in TS 38.461 [5] and TS 38.462 [6]. The E1 application protocol (E1AP) is specified in TS 38.463 [7] and includes the description of: (1) the E1 interface management procedures, which allow to setup the E1 interface and to exchange the relevant configuration data between a gNB-CU-CP and a gNB-CU-UP; (2) the bearer context management procedures, which allow to setup and configure user plane resources to serve UEs.\n\nReferences\n\n12.1.2\tManagement Enhancement for EPC Control and User Plane Separation (CUPS)\n\nSummary based on the input provided by Huawei in SP-190029.\n\nThis work item specified management enhancements to support EPC CUPS, including performance measurements related to split S/P-GW architecture in TS 32.426, EPC Network Resource Model (NRM) Integration Reference Point (IRP) Information Service (IS) and Solution Set (SS) modifications in TS 28.708 and TS 28.709.\n\nThis work item implemented the conclusion of the study on Management Enhancement of CUPS of EPC Nodes (FS_MECUPS).

The untruncated name and some of the metadata are to be retrieved from authoritative data sources by the terminating service provider.\n\nDescription\n\neCNAM does not deliver messages from the originator across multiple networks to the terminating user. eCNAM is a service that resides in the terminating service provider's (SP) network, most likely in the Telephony Application Server (TAS). However, it utilizes the identity information received in SIP signalling.\n\nThe untruncated name is delivered in the \"display-name\" parameter of the From header field and/or P-Asserted-Identity header field that the terminating Application Server sends to the terminating UE.\n\nThe metadata will be delivered in one or more Call-Info header field(s). The eCNAM service logic in the AS assembles and formats several data elements (subject to local policy). eCNAM metadata may include type of call, location of a business, or language of the originator. Furthermore, eCNAM metadata may include the results of robocalling analytics that are used to alert the subscriber of possible scams. Typically, service providers partner with analytics providers that offer risk indicators about incoming calls (e.g., known scammers). The results of such analytics are relayed to the user in the form of text strings and/or icons to be displayed on his/her UE. The eCNAM Call-Info header fields support the delivery of text and icons. Given the changing nature of scams, the results of the analytics are expected to vary. eCNAM provides the advantage of a flexible \"envelope\" - namely the Call-Info header field(s) - that delivers different types of payload without having to modify existing standards frequently.\n\nReferences",

Most of these main characteristics would lead to some addition / modification of PLDC and MAC frame structure. These detailed changes will be summarized in each corresponding sections. If you are not familiar with WLAN frame structure and basic operations I would recommend you to go through WLAN Frame structure and WLAN protocol page first.\n\nAs in almost every evolution of every communication technology (except IoT), the major motivation of 802.11ac is to achieve much higher throughput than the previous highest throughput technology (802.11n in this case). I am pretty sure that you will see another technology targeted for even higher throughput than 802.11ac (We are already hearing of 802.11ad).\n\nThen what is the technical strategy to achieve this high throughput ? Overall strategy is also same as other technology (If you have seen the evolution process of celluar technology (e.g, WCDMA -> HSPA -> DC HSPA or LTE -> LTE MIMO -> Carrier Aggregation etc), you will easily understand the strategy. Some of the technologies for this evolution can be listed as follows\n\nWith the list in mind, if you try to correlate each of these technologies to each items of specification of 802.11ac, it will be much easier to get the big picture or motivation of those specification.\n\nJust to give you more practical insight on this motivation, I would compare 802.11n (the most advanced technology before 802.11ac) and 802.11ac with the respect t the features/technologies listed above. (NOTE : I got most of these information from Ref [13]. I would recommend you to read through this document at least once if you have time)\n\nNo new technology can be invented overnight. We all understand this. However, we don't want to wait forever until everything is ready all at once. A common practice in this case is to split those requirement/wishlist into multiple chunks and attack them chunk by chunk. In some technology, they call these chunk as 'Stage' (like Stage 1, Stage 2 etc) and in some technology they call them as 'Phase' (e.g, Phase 1, Phase 2 etc). In 802.11ac, they call them as Wave (e.g, Wave 1, Wave 2 etc). 802.11ac has been evolved as two Waves (at least as of now, Aug 2016) as listed below.\n\nIf you have a 802.11ac WLAN Card (device), the first thing you have to do is to figure out the Access Point (AP) around the device support 802.11ac. (Actually you don't need to figure out this, your WLAN device will figure out :).\n\nThen how your WLAN device will figure out whether the AP support 802.11ac or not ? It is by decoding the special information signal from the AP called Beacon. If your AP support 802.11ac, it will broadcast Beancon signal containing following information.\n\nFollowing Beacon Signal is the one from a WLAN Test equipment, Anritsu MT8862. Anritsu kindly provided me a full sample log starting from Beacon through user data and it will be a great resource for my study. I will sharing more as I learn more from the log. You can see the test setup on how this log is captured.\n\nIt may look simple two lines of information, but it will contain a lot of details of the 802.11ac capability that the AP supports. Following is the full decoded information.\n\n.... .... .... .... .... .... .... ..10 = Maximum MPDU Length: 11 454 (0x00000002)\n\n.... .... .... .... .... .... .... 00.. = Supported Channel Width Set: Neither 160MHz\n\n.... .... .... .... .... .... .0.. .... = Short GI for 160MHz and 80+80MHz: Not supported\n\n.... .... .... .... 000. .... .... .... = Compressed Steering Number of Beamformer Antennas\n\n.... .... .... .000 .... .... .... .... = Number of Sounding Dimensions: 1 (0x00000000)\n\n.... .... .0.. .... .... .... .... .... = +HTC-VHT Capable (VHT variant HT Control field):\n\n.... ..11 1... .... .... .... .... .... = Max A-MPDU Length: 1 048 575 (0x00000007)\n\n.... 00.. .... .... .... .... .... .... = VHT Link Adaptation: No Feedback (0x00000000)\n\n...0 .... .... .... .... .... .... .... = Rx Antenna Pattern Consistency: Not supported\n\n..0. .... .... .... .... .... .... .... = Tx Antenna Pattern Consistency: Not supported\n\n...0 0000 0000 0000 = Rx Highest Long GI Data Rate (in Mb/s, 0 = subfield not in use):\n\n...0 0000 0000 0000 = Tx Highest Long GI Data Rate (in Mb/s, 0 = subfield not in use):\n\nCommunication is the exchange of information between two or more parties. The previous section showed how the device can figure out the 802.11ac capability of AP. Then you would ask how the AP can figure out 802.11ac capability of the device. The AP can figure out the device capability from [Probe Request] message from the device as shown below.\n\n.... .... .... .... .... .... .... ..0. = Receive Staggered Sounding: Not supported\n\n.... .... .... .... .00. .... .... .... = Receiver can return explicit uncompressed\n\n...0 0... .... .... .... .... .... .... = Maximum number of space time streams for\n\n.... .... .... .... .... .... .... ..10 = Maximum MPDU Length: 11 454 (0x00000002)\n\n.... .... .... .... 010. .... .... .... = Compressed Steering Number of Beamformer\n\n.... .... .0.. .... .... .... .... .... = +HTC-VHT Capable (VHT variant HT Control\n\n.... ..11 1... .... .... .... .... .... = Max A-MPDU Length:1 048 575 (0x00000007)\n\n...1 .... .... .... .... .... .... .... = Rx Antenna Pattern Consistency:Supported\n\n..1. .... .... .... .... .... .... .... = Tx Antenna Pattern Consistency:Supported\n\nOne of the most important keywords in 802.11ac would VHT. VHT stands for Very High Throughput. You would not need any additional explanation on what this means. The meaning is obvious and self-explanatory.\n\nThe question is how to achieve VHT and what kind of new frames and protocols are introduced to implement this.\n\nIn wireshark log, you may see this framing information from Radiotap Header as shown below.\n\n802.11ac support various types of bandwidth combination like 20 Mhz, 80 Mhz, 160 Mhz. Then the question would 'how do they allocate the bandwidth ?'. Statically or Dynamically ?\n\nStatic allocation means that Transmitter (Initiator) and Reciever(Responder) negotiate and determines the bandwidth during early stage of connection setup and keep it same until the end of communication (a session).\n\nDynamic allocation means that Transmitter and Reciever SOMEHOW negotiate/determine the bandwidth in very short interval even during a single session.\n\n802.11ac picked up the dynamic allocation approach. It allows the change of the bandwidth at every transmission.\n\nThen the question is 'HOW ?'. What kind of negotiation they use to determine/agree upon the bandwidth between Transmitter and Reciever ?\n\nBasic Idea is simple. As you see in Data Transmission in Detail section, basic channel acquisition process for all 802.11 is based on RTS/CTS mechanism. 802.11ac use the same mechanism to determine the avaiable bandwidth dynamically. The idea is to split the whole possible 802.11ac band into multiple blocks of basic segments (e.g, 20 Mhz, 40 Mhz, 80 Mhz etc) and perform the multiple RTS/CTS simulateneously across the multiple frequency block. (It is very similary for Carrier Aggregation in LTE). First, the initiator sends multiple RTS accross the multiple frequency block and wait for CTS. If the initiator recieves CTS accross the all the blocks, it can use all the frequency blocks (very wide aggregated bandwidth). If the initiator recieves only a few CTS for the all transmitted RTS, it uses the smaller bandwidth for which CTS is recieved. (Refer to Ref [9] for the details).\n\nLet me give you a couple of examples with illustration on how Dynamic Bandwidth goes. Here goes only two cases but there can be much more variations on this.\n\nThis is the case where there is no interference between Node A(initiator) and Node B(recipient) and the full bandwith is avaiable for both nodes. Of course, these nodes does not know anything about the bandwidth availability before it completes step 3. Step 0 : Right before Step 1, it is assumed that Node A split the whole 80 Mhz section into 4 contiguous 20 Mhz block and performed carrier sensing for each of these 20 Mhz block. And it is assumed that all of these 20 Mhz block turned out to be available. Step 1 : Node A wait for a certain time period called DIFS(DCF Inter Frame Space), assuming that the scheduling is done in DCF. Step 2 : Node A transmit RTS for each of 20 Mhz block to Node B using 802.11a frame and it is assumed that all of these RTS reached Node B successfully. Step 3 : (Assuming that Node B detected RTS for all of 20 Mhz blocks) Node B transmit CTS using 802.11a frame for every 20 Mhz subblocks. Step 4 : (Assuming that Node A detected CTS for all of 20 Mhz blocks) Node A assumes that all 80Mhz BW is clear/no-interference and transmit the data in 802.11ac mode utilizing the full 80 Mhz. Step 5 : (Assuming that Node B received and decoded the whole data) Node B sends Ack for every 20 Mhz blocks (40 Mhz in total).\n\nThis is the case where there is some interference in some spectrum blocks within the 80 Mhz block on Node B(recipient). Of course, these nodes does not know anything about the bandwidth availability before it completes step 3. Step 0 : Right before Step 1, it is assumed that Node A split the whole 80 Mhz section into 4 contiguous 20 Mhz block and performed carrier sensing for each of these 20 Mhz block. And it is assumed that all of these 20 Mhz block turned out to be available. Step 1 : Node A wait for a certain time period called DIFS(DCF Inter Frame Space), assuming that the scheduling is done in DCF. Step 2 : Node A transmit RTS for each of 20 Mhz block to Node B using 802.11a frame. Step 3 : (In various reason, e.g, Node B failed to receive RTS due to interference or Medium is busy based on carrier sensing ) Node B transmit CTS using 802.11a frame for only two consecutive 20 Mhz blocks. Step 4 : (Assuming that Node A detected CTS for the two 20 Mhz blocks) Node A assumes that only 40Mhz BW is clear/no-interference and transmit the data in 802.11ac mode utilizing the 40 Mhz. Step 5 : (Assuming that Node B received and decoded the whole data) Node B sends Ack for the two 20 Mhz blocks (40 Mhz in total).\n\nIn 802.11ac, Following new Frame Types are added to the existing type. Most of New Frametype is for impelementing Channel Measurement and Report to perform MU-MIMO Beamforming.\n\nThis frame is used for BeamFormer (AP) to initiate Channel Measurement Process. (Refer to 802.11ac 8.3.1.20 VHT NDP Announcement frame format for the details)\n\nIt indicates the number of columns, Nc, in the Compressed Beamforming Feedback Matrix\n\nThis frame is used for BeamFormee (user) to report channel measurement result (Refer to 802.11ac 8.5.23.2 VHT Compressed Beamforming frame format for the details)\n\nTo perform proper beamforming for specific devices, it is crucial to figure out accurate channel condition between BeamFormer and BeanFormee. To figure out the channel condition, BeamFormer and BeamFormee performs a specific sequence of calibration process and this process is called Channel Measurement or Sounding process. It goes as follows.\n\nRefer to 802.11ac 9.31.5.2 Rules for VHT sounding protocol sequences, Figure 9-41a and Figure 9-41a for the details.\n\nNOTE : The fundamental purpose of this complicated process is to figure out the charateristics (nature) of radio channel between the Access Point and Devices. This is also called 'Channel Sounding'. During this process, no user data is conveyed. It means this process can be a kind of overhead (throughput degradation factor). If AP can best optimize the communication by extracting the most suitable BeamForming parameters from this process, this process can give a overall throughput gain. However, if AP failed to get the best BeamForming parameters from this process, this would just create unncessary overhead.\n\nMU-MIMO stands for Multi User MIMO and this is adopted only in 802.11ac (not in 802.11n and lower). When we say MIMO(Multi Input Multi Output), it normally mean SU-MIMO(Single User MIMO), which is a MIMO targeted to only one device(user). On the contrary, MU-MIMO is the MIMO targeted to multiple user simulateneously. It mean that in MU-MIMO the transmitter (Access Point) can transmite the multiple stream of data targeted to multiple user.\n\nIt sounds fancy, right ? However, the implementation of this technology would not be as easy as it sound and real performance would not be as good as expected. Probably it would need to go through a long way of evolution. Let's think of some of the challenges and possible issues related to MU-MIMO\n\nPutting aside the practical feasibility of this MU-MIMO, the specification is done. In most case of technology (even though it is not all the case), once the specification is issued the technology continues to evolve and get better and better.\n\n802.11ac MU-MIMO Beamforming is expressed in a mathematical expression as follows (this is based on 802.11ac 22.3.11 SU-MIMO and DL-MU-MIMO Beamforming)\n\nWhenever a new version of any technology comes out, one of the most concerning thing is compatibility. Can this new stuff work with all of those old stuffs out there already ? You would have the same questions about 802.11ac. Is 802.11ac compatitle with the existing (previous) techology (e.g, 802.11a and 802.11n) ? The answer is Yes. 802.11ac is designed from beginning to be compatible with 802.11a / n both for Access point and devices.\n\n[12] How to validate the WI-FI Information within Wireshark Part I: Determining the WLAN capabilities",
