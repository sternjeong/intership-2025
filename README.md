Telecom Chatbot

An AI chatbot tailored for the telecommunications domain, developed to process and understand the massive volumes of data generated across diverse network environments. By fine-tuning on the TeleQnA (multiple-choice) and TeleQuAD (open-ended) datasets, it delivers highly accurate question-and-answer capabilities. It also employs a RAG system powered by a FAISS vector store for instant retrieval and utilization of technical documents. Finally, the complete solution can be easily deployed and managed as a Gradio application.
